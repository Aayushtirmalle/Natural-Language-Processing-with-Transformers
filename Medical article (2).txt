AB  - A potentially organizing goal of the brain and cognitive sciences is to 
      accurately explain domains of human intelligence as executable, neurally 
      mechanistic models. Years of research have led to models that capture 
      experimental results in individual behavioral tasks and individual brain regions. 
      We here advocate for taking the next step: integrating experimental results from 
      many laboratories into suites of benchmarks that, when considered together, push 
      mechanistic models toward explaining entire domains of intelligence, such as 
      vision, language, and motor control. Given recent successes of neurally 
      mechanistic models and the surging availability of neural, anatomical, and 
      behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative 
      benchmarking platforms that incentivize ambitious, unified models. This 
      perspective discusses the advantages and the challenges of this approach and 
      proposes specific steps to achieve this goal in the domain of visual intelligence 
      with the case study of an integrative benchmarking platform called Brain-Score.

TI  - g versus c: comparing individual and collective intelligence across two 
      meta-analyses.

AB  - Collective intelligence (CI) is said to manifest in a group's domain general 
      mental ability. It can be measured across a battery of group IQ tests and 
      statistically reduced to a latent factor called the "c-factor." Advocates have 
      found the c-factor predicts group performance better than individual IQ. We test 
      this claim by meta-analyzing correlations between the c-factor and nine group 
      performance criterion tasks generated by eight independent samples (N = 857 
      groups). Results indicated a moderate correlation, r, of .26 (95% CI .10, .40). 
      All but four studies comprising five independent samples (N = 366 groups) failed 
      to control for the intelligence of individual members using individual IQ scores 
      or their statistically reduced equivalent (i.e., the g-factor). A meta-analysis 
      of this subset of studies found the average IQ of the groups' members had little 
      to no correlation with group performance (r = .06, 95% CI -.08, .20). Around 80% 
      of studies did not have enough statistical power to reliably detect correlations 
      between the primary predictor variables and the criterion tasks. Though some of 
      our findings are consistent with claims that a general factor of group 
      performance may exist and relate positively to group performance, limitations 
      suggest alternative explanations cannot be dismissed. We caution against 
      prematurely embracing notions of the c-factor unless it can be independently and 
      robustly replicated and demonstrated to be incrementally valid beyond the 
      g-factor in group performance contexts.

AB  - Collective intelligence (CI) is critical to solving many scientific, business, 
      and other problems, but groups often fail to achieve it. Here, we analyze data on 
      group performance from 22 studies, including 5,279 individuals in 1,356 groups. 
      Our results support the conclusion that a robust CI factor characterizes a 
      group's ability to work together across a diverse set of tasks. We further show 
      that CI is predicted by the proportion of women in the group, mediated by average 
      social perceptiveness of group members, and that it predicts performance on 
      various out-of-sample criterion tasks. We also find that, overall, group 
      collaboration process is more important in predicting CI than the skill of 
      individual members.

AB  - Intelligence, as measured by standardised tests of cognitive function, such as 
      IQ-type tests, is predictive of psychiatric diagnosis and psychological 
      wellbeing. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, a measure of the 
      shared genetic effect across traits, can be quantified; because this can be done 
      across samples, the confounding effects of psychiatric diagnosis do not influence 
      the magnitude of these relationships. It is now known that there are genetic 
      effects that act across intelligence and psychiatric diagnoses, which provide a 
      partial explanation for the phenotypic link between intelligence and mental 
      health. Potential causal effects between intelligence and mental health have been 
      identified, and the regions of the genome responsible for some of these cross 
      trait associations have begun to be characterised.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health professionals maintain 
      the health of citizens through evidence-based medicine and caring. Students 
      enroled in health professional programmes are required to have successfully 
      attained all core learning outcomes by reaching key milestones throughout the 
      course of their studies, demonstrating they have developed the required graduate 
      skills and attributes upon completion of the programme. While some of the 
      knowledge, skills and competencies that make up these learning outcomes are very 
      discipline specific, there are more general professional skills across all 
      disciplines which are difficult to define, such as empathy, emotional 
      intelligence and interprofessional skills. These are at the heart of all health 
      professional programmes that once defined, can be mapped through curricula and 
      further evaluated. Literature will be presented on these three professional 
      skills: empathy, emotional intelligence, and interprofessional skills, based on 
      studies that focussed primarily in health professional programmes and highlight 
      some of the key findings and issues at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The 
      paper will present the need for these skills to be defined and then mapped 
      through curricula so that students are better supported in their professional 
      development. Empathy, emotional intelligence and interprofessional skills 
      transcend the discipline specific skills and as such it is important that all 
      educators consider how best these may be fostered. Efforts should also be made to 
      further the integration of these professional skills within curricula to produce 
      health professionals with an enhanced focus on person-centred care.

TI  - Neural Contributions to Reduced Fluid Intelligence across the Adult Lifespan.
PG  - 293-307
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0148-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines 
      steeply during healthy human aging. Using fMRI, fluid intelligence has been 
      repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and 
      impairment following focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid 
      intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that 
      age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the 
      reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge 
      Center for Ageing and Neuroscience data, a large, population-based cohort of 
      healthy males and females across the adult lifespan. The data support a model in 
      which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the 
      responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first 
      replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then 
      precisely localize the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is 
      specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not 
      with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this 
      result to potential unmodeled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of 
      the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of 
      age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of 
      regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. 
      An additional moderating role of the variety of nonphysical activities emerged 
      when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that 
      link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for 
      mitigating such decline.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Global populations are living 
      longer, driving urgency to understand age-related cognitive declines. Fluid 
      intelligence is of prime importance because it reflects performance across many 
      domains, and declines especially steeply during healthy aging. Despite consensus 
      that fluid intelligence is associated with particular frontoparietal brain 
      regions, little research has investigated suggestions that under-responsiveness 
      of these regions mediates age-related decline. We replicate a recent 
      demonstration of such mediation, showing specific association with brain regions 
      most activated by cognitive demand, and robustness to moderate confounding by 
      unmodeled variables. By showing that this mediation model is moderated by the 
      variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or 
      duration, we identify a potential modifiable lifestyle factor that may help 
      promote successful aging.

TI  - Predicting intelligence from brain gray matter volume.
PG  - 2111-2129
LID - 10.1007/s00429-020-02113-7 [doi]
AB  - A positive association between brain size and intelligence is firmly established, 
      but whether region-specific anatomical differences contribute to general 
      intelligence remains an open question. Results from voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 
      - one of the most widely used morphometric methods - have remained inconclusive 
      so far. Here, we applied cross-validated machine learning-based predictive 
      modeling to test whether out-of-sample prediction of individual intelligence 
      scores is possible on the basis of voxel-wise gray matter volume. Features were 
      derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging data (N = 308) using (a) a 
      purely data-driven method (principal component analysis) and (b) a domain 
      knowledge-based approach (atlas parcellation). When using relative gray matter 
      (corrected for total brain size), only the atlas-based approach provided 
      significant prediction, while absolute gray matter (uncorrected) allowed for 
      above-chance prediction with both approaches. Importantly, in all significant 
      predictions, the absolute error was relatively high, i.e., greater than ten IQ 
      points, and in the atlas-based models, the predicted IQ scores varied closely 
      around the sample mean. This renders the practical value even of statistically 
      significant prediction results questionable. Analyses based on the gray matter of 
      functional brain networks yielded significant predictions for the fronto-parietal 
      network and the cerebellum. However, the mean absolute errors were not reduced in 
      contrast to the global models, suggesting that general intelligence may be 
      related more to global than region-specific differences in gray matter volume. 
      More generally, our study highlights the importance of predictive statistical 
      analysis approaches for clarifying the neurobiological bases of intelligence and 
      provides important suggestions for future research using predictive modeling.

TI  - The role of prefrontal cortex in cognitive control and executive function.
PG  - 72-89
LID - 10.1038/s41386-021-01132-0 [doi]
AB  - Concepts of cognitive control (CC) and executive function (EF) are defined in 
      terms of their relationships with goal-directed behavior versus habits and 
      controlled versus automatic processing, and related to the functions of the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and related regions and networks. A psychometric approach 
      shows unity and diversity in CC constructs, with 3 components in the most 
      commonly studied constructs: general or common CC and components specific to 
      mental set shifting and working memory updating. These constructs are considered 
      against the cellular and systems neurobiology of PFC and what is known of its 
      functional neuroanatomical or network organization based on lesioning, 
      neurochemical, and neuroimaging approaches across species. CC is also considered 
      in the context of motivation, as "cool" and "hot" forms. Its Common CC component 
      is shown to be distinct from general intelligence (g) and closely related to 
      response inhibition. Impairments in CC are considered as possible causes of 
      psychiatric symptoms and consequences of disorders. The relationships of CC with 
      the general factor of psychopathology (p) and dimensional constructs such as 
      impulsivity in large scale developmental and adult populations are considered, as 
      well as implications for genetic studies and RDoC approaches to psychiatric 
      classification.

TI  - Imaginaries of omniscience: Automating intelligence in the US Department of 
      Defense.
PG  - 761-786
LID - 10.1177/03063127221104938 [doi]
AB  - The current reanimation of artificial intelligence includes a resurgence of 
      investment in automating military intelligence on the part of the US Department 
      of Defense. A series of programs set forth a technopolitical imaginary of fully 
      integrated, comprehensive and real-time 'situational awareness' across US 
      theaters of operation. Locating this imaginary within the history of 'closed 
      world' discourse, I offer a critical reading of dominant scholarship within 
      military circles that sets out the military's cybernetic model of situational 
      awareness in the form of the widely referenced Observe, Orient, Decide, Act or 
      OODA Loop. I argue that the loop's promise of dynamic homeostasis is held in 
      place by the enduring premise of objectivist knowledge, enabled through a war 
      apparatus that treats the contingencies and ambiguities of relations on the 
      ground as noise from which a stable and unambiguous signal can be extracted. In 
      contrast, recent challenges to the closed-world imaginary, based on critical 
      scholarship and investigative journalism, suggest that the aspiration to closure 
      is an engine for the continued destructiveness of US interventions and the 
      associated regeneration of enmity. To challenge these technopolitics of violence 
      we need a radically different kind of situational awareness, one that recognizes 
      the place of ignorance in perpetuating the project of militarism. Only that kind 
      of awareness can inform the public debate required to re-envision a future place 
      for the US in the world, founded in alternative investments in demilitarization 
      and commitments to our collective security.
