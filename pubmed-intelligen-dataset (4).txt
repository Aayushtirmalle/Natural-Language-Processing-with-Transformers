TI  - Large language models in radiology: fundamentals, applications, ethical 
      considerations, risks, and future directions.
LID - 10.4274/dir.2023.232417 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the artificial intelligence 
      revolution in medicine and radiology is now more tangible than ever. Every day, 
      an increasingly large number of articles are published that utilize LLMs in 
      radiology. To adopt and safely implement this new technology in the field, 
      radiologists should be familiar with its key concepts, understand at least the 
      technical basics, and be aware of the potential risks and ethical considerations 
      that come with it. In this review article, the authors provide an overview of the 
      LLMs that might be relevant to the radiology community and include a brief 
      discussion of their short history, technical basics, ChatGPT, prompt engineering, 
      potential applications in medicine and radiology, advantages, disadvantages and 
      risks, ethical and regulatory considerations, and future directions.

AB  - What is the educational challenge?Medical schools invest significant resources 
      into the creation of multiple-choice items for assessments. This process is 
      costly and requires faculty training. Recently ChatGPT has been used in various 
      areas to improve content creation efficiency, and it has otherwise been used to 
      answer USMLE-style assessment items.What are the proposed solutions?We proposed 
      the use of ChatGPT to create initial drafts of multiple-choice items.What are the 
      potential benefits to a wider global audience?The use of ChatGPT to generate 
      assessment items can decrease resources required, allowing for the creation of 
      more items, and freeing-up faculty time to perform higher level assessment 
      activities. ChatGPT is also able to consistently produce items using a standard 
      format while adhering to item writing guidelines, which can be very challenging 
      for faculty teams.What are the next steps?We plan to pilot ChatGPT drafted 
      questions and compare item statistics for those written by ChatGPT with those 
      written by our content experts. We also plan to further identify the types of 
      questions that ChatGPT is most appropriate for, and incorporate media into 
      assessment items (e.g. images, videos).

TI  - ChatGPT in pharmacy practice: a cross-sectional exploration of Jordanian 
      pharmacists' perception, practice, and concerns.
PG  - 115
LID - 10.1186/s40545-023-00624-2 [doi]
LID - 115
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to find out how much pharmacists know 
      and have used ChatGPT in their practice. We investigated the advantages and 
      disadvantages of utilizing ChatGPT in a pharmacy context, the amount of training 
      necessary to use it proficiently, and the influence on patient care using a 
      survey. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between May and June 
      2023 to assess the potential and problems that pharmacists observed while 
      integrating chatbots powered by AI (ChatGPT) in pharmacy practice. The 
      correlation between perceived benefits and concerns was evaluated using 
      Spearman's rho correlation due to the data's non-normal distribution.Any 
      pharmacists licensed by the Jordanian Pharmacists Association were included in 
      the study. A convenient sampling technique was used to choose the participants, 
      and the study questionnaire was distributed utilizing an online medium (Facebook 
      and WhatsApp). Anyone who expressed interest in taking part was given a link to 
      the study's instructions so they may read them before giving their electronic 
      consent and accessing the survey. RESULTS: The potential advantages of ChatGPT in 
      the pharmacy practice were widely acknowledged by the participants. The majority 
      of participants (69.9%) concurred that educational material about pharmacy items 
      or therapeutic areas can be provided using ChatGPT, with 66.9% of respondents 
      believing that ChatGPT is a machine learning algorithm. Concerns about the 
      accuracy of AI-generated responses were also prevalent. More than half of the 
      participants (55.7%) raised the possibility that AI systems such as ChatGPT could 
      pick up on and replicate prejudices and discriminatory patterns from the data 
      they were trained on. Analysis shows a statistically significant positive link, 
      albeit a minor one, between the perceived advantages of ChatGPT and its drawbacks 
      (r = 0.255, p < 0.001). However, concerns were strongly correlated with knowledge 
      of ChatGPT. In contrast to those who were either unsure or had not heard of 
      ChatGPT (64.2%), individuals who had heard of it were more likely to have strong 
      concerns (79.8%) (p = 0.002). Finally, the results show a statistically 
      significant association between the frequency of ChatGPT use and positive 
      perceptions of the tool (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although ChatGPT has shown 
      promise in health and pharmaceutical practice, its application should be 
      rigorously regulated by evidence-based law. According to the study's findings, 
      pharmacists support the use of ChatGPT in pharmacy practice but have concerns 
      about its use due to ethical reasons, legal problems, privacy concerns, worries 
      about the accuracy of the data generated, data learning, and bias risk.

TI  - plotnineSeqSuite: a Python package for visualizing sequence data using ggplot2 
      style.
PG  - 585
LID - 10.1186/s12864-023-09677-8 [doi]
LID - 585
AB  - BACKGROUND: The visual sequence logo has been a hot area in the development of 
      bioinformatics tools. ggseqlogo written in R language has been the most popular 
      API since it was published. With the popularity of artificial intelligence and 
      deep learning, Python is currently the most popular programming language. The 
      programming language used by bioinformaticians began to shift to Python. 
      Providing APIs in Python that are similar to those in R can reduce the learning 
      cost of relearning a programming language. And compared to ggplot2 in R, drawing 
      framework is not as easy to use in Python. The appearance of plotnine (ggplot2 in 
      Python version) makes it possible to unify the programming methods of 
      bioinformatics visualization tools between R and Python. RESULTS: Here, we 
      introduce plotnineSeqSuite, a new plotnine-based Python package provides a 
      ggseqlogo-like API for programmatic drawing of sequence logos, sequence alignment 
      diagrams and sequence histograms. To be more precise, it supports custom letters, 
      color themes, and fonts. Moreover, the class for drawing layers is based on 
      object-oriented design so that users can easily encapsulate and extend it. 
      CONCLUSIONS: plotnineSeqSuite is the first ggplot2-style package to implement 
      visualization of sequence -related graphs in Python. It enhances the uniformity 
      of programmatic plotting between R and Python. Compared with tools appeared 
      already, the categories supported by plotnineSeqSuite are much more complete. The 
      source code of plotnineSeqSuite can be obtained on GitHub ( 
      https://github.com/caotianze/plotnineseqsuite ) and PyPI ( 
      https://pypi.org/project/plotnineseqsuite ), and the documentation homepage is 
      freely available on GitHub at ( https://caotianze.github.io/plotnineseqsuite/ ).

AB  - Artificial intelligence has opened a new path of innovation in magnetic resonance 
      (MR) image reconstruction of undersampled k-space acquisitions. This review 
      offers readers an analysis of the current deep learning-based MR image 
      reconstruction methods. The literature in this field shows exponential growth, 
      both in volume and complexity, as the capabilities of machine learning in solving 
      inverse problems such as image reconstruction are explored. We review the latest 
      developments, aiming to assist researchers and radiologists who are developing 
      new methods or seeking to provide valuable feedback. We shed light on key 
      concepts by exploring the technical intricacies of MR image reconstruction, 
      highlighting the importance of raw datasets and the difficulty of evaluating 
      diagnostic value using standard metrics.Relevance statement Increasingly complex 
      algorithms output reconstructed images that are difficult to assess for 
      robustness and diagnostic quality, necessitating high-quality datasets and 
      collaboration with radiologists.Key points• Deep learning-based image 
      reconstruction algorithms are increasing both in complexity and performance.• The 
      evaluation of reconstructed images may mistake perceived image quality for 
      diagnostic value.• Collaboration with radiologists is crucial for advancing deep 
      learning technology.

TI  - An eXplainable Artificial Intelligence analysis of Raman spectra for thyroid 
      cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy shows great potential as a diagnostic tool for thyroid cancer 
      due to its ability to detect biochemical changes during cancer development. This 
      technique is particularly valuable because it is non-invasive and label/dye-free. 
      Compared to molecular tests, Raman spectroscopy analyses can more effectively 
      discriminate malignant features, thus reducing unnecessary surgeries. However, 
      one major hurdle to using Raman spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool is the 
      identification of significant patterns and peaks. In this study, we propose a 
      Machine Learning procedure to discriminate healthy/benign versus malignant 
      nodules that produces interpretable results. We collect Raman spectra obtained 
      from histological samples, select a set of peaks with a data-driven and label 
      independent approach and train the algorithms with the relative prominence of the 
      peaks in the selected set. The performance of the considered models, quantified 
      by area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, exceeds 0.9. To 
      enhance the interpretability of the results, we employ eXplainable Artificial 
      Intelligence and compute the contribution of each feature to the prediction of 
      each sample.

AB  - In this chapter, we discuss the potential role that artificial intelligence (AI) 
      may have in medical decision-making, the pros and cons, and the limitations and 
      biases that might be introduced when using these novel techniques. As computing 
      becomes more powerful and models continue to grow increasingly more complex, the 
      potential of AI to improve decision-making is increasingly promising. Within many 
      medical fields, however, at the time of this writing (September 2023), the 
      promise of AI is yet to translate into everyday reality. Here, we summarize the 
      role of AI in medical decision-making (diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment).

TI  - Improving diagnosis accuracy with an intelligent image retrieval system for lung 
      pathologies detection: a features extractor approach.
PG  - 16619
LID - 10.1038/s41598-023-42366-w [doi]
LID - 16619
AB  - Detecting lung pathologies is critical for precise medical diagnosis. In the 
      realm of diagnostic methods, various approaches, including imaging tests, 
      physical examinations, and laboratory tests, contribute to this process. Of 
      particular note, imaging techniques like X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans play a 
      pivotal role in identifying lung pathologies with their non-invasive insights. 
      Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, holds significant promise in 
      revolutionizing the detection and diagnosis of lung pathologies. By leveraging 
      expansive datasets, deep learning algorithms autonomously discern intricate 
      patterns and features within medical images, such as chest X-rays and CT scans. 
      These algorithms exhibit an exceptional capacity to recognize subtle markers 
      indicative of lung diseases. Yet, while their potential is evident, inherent 
      limitations persist. The demand for abundant labeled data during training and the 
      susceptibility to data biases challenge their accuracy. To address these 
      formidable challenges, this research introduces a tailored computer-assisted 
      system designed for the automatic retrieval of annotated medical images that 
      share similar content. At its core lies an intelligent deep learning-based 
      features extractor, adept at simplifying the retrieval of analogous images from 
      an extensive chest radiograph database. The crux of our innovation rests upon the 
      fusion of YOLOv5 and EfficientNet within the features extractor module. This 
      strategic fusion synergizes YOLOv5's rapid and efficient object detection 
      capabilities with EfficientNet's proficiency in combating noisy predictions. The 
      result is a distinctive amalgamation that redefines the efficiency and accuracy 
      of features extraction. Through rigorous experimentation conducted on an 
      extensive and diverse dataset, our proposed solution decisively surpasses 
      conventional methodologies. The model's achievement of a mean average precision 
      of 0.488 with a threshold of 0.9 stands as a testament to its effectiveness, 
      overshadowing the results of YOLOv5 + ResNet and EfficientDet, which achieved 
      0.234 and 0.257 respectively. Furthermore, our model demonstrates a marked 
      precision improvement, attaining a value of 0.864 across all pathologies-a 
      noteworthy leap of approximately 0.352 compared to YOLOv5 + ResNet and 
      EfficientDet. This research presents a significant stride toward enhancing 
      radiologists' workflow efficiency, offering a refined and proficient tool for 
      retrieving analogous annotated medical images.
