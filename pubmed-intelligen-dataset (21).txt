TI  - Dissecting the chain of information processing and its interplay with 
      neurochemicals and fluid intelligence across development.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.84086 [doi]
LID - e84086
AB  - Previous research has highlighted the role of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA) in perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks. However, the exact 
      involvement of these neurochemical mechanisms in the chain of information 
      processing, and across human development, is unclear. In a cross-sectional 
      longitudinal design, we used a computational approach to dissociate cognitive, 
      decision, and visuomotor processing in 293 individuals spanning early childhood 
      to adulthood. We found that glutamate and GABA within the intraparietal sulcus 
      (IPS) explained unique variance in visuomotor processing, with higher glutamate 
      predicting poorer visuomotor processing in younger participants but better 
      visuomotor processing in mature participants, while GABA showed the opposite 
      pattern. These findings, which were neurochemically, neuroanatomically and 
      functionally specific, were replicated ~21 mo later and were generalized in two 
      further different behavioral tasks. Using resting functional MRI, we revealed 
      that the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is 
      mediated by functional connectivity in the visuomotor network. We then extended 
      our findings to high-level cognitive behavior by predicting fluid intelligence 
      performance. We present evidence that fluid intelligence performance is explained 
      by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing. However, this 
      evidence was obtained using an uncorrected alpha and needs to be replicated in 
      future studies. These results provide an integrative biological and psychological 
      mechanistic explanation that links cognitive processes and neurotransmitters 
      across human development and establishes their potential involvement in 
      intelligent behavior.

TI  - Recent advancement in integrating artificial intelligence and information 
      technology with real-world data for clinical decision-making in China: A scoping 
      review.
PG  - 534-546
LID - 10.1111/jebm.12549 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Striking innovations and advancements have been achieved with the use 
      of artificial intelligence and healthcare information technology being integrated 
      into clinical real-world data. The current scoping review aimed to provide an 
      overview of the current status of artificial intelligence-/information 
      technology-based clinical decision support tools in China. METHODS: 
      PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, China National Knowledge Internet, and Wanfang data were 
      searched for both English and Chinese literature. The gray literature search was 
      conducted for commercially available tools. Original studies that focused on 
      clinical decision support tools driven by artificial intelligence or information 
      technology in China and were published between 2010 and February 2022 were 
      included. Information extracted from each article was further synthesized by 
      themes based on three types of clinical decision-making. RESULTS: A total of 37 
      peer-reviewed publications and 13 commercially available tools were included in 
      the final analysis. Among them, 32.0% were developed for disease diagnosis, 54.0% 
      for risk prediction and classification, and 14.0% for disease management. Chronic 
      diseases were the most popular therapeutic areas of exploration, with particular 
      emphasis on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Single-center electronic 
      medical records were the mainstream data sources leveraged to inform clinical 
      decision-making, with internal validation being predominately used for model 
      evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: To effectively promote the extensive use of real-world 
      data and drive a paradigm shift in clinical decision-making in China, 
      multidisciplinary collaboration of key stakeholders is urgently needed.

      Factorial Structure and Relationship with Health Variables.

LID - 10.1017/SJP.2023.25 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to conduct a preliminary study of the Stanford 
      Gender-Related Variables for Health Research (GVHR) adapted to the Spanish 
      population, testing its factor structure, sex factorial invariance and 
      relationship with health variables. Participants were 438 adults between 19-73 
      years old (M = 31.90, SD = 12.12) who completed the GVHR and measures of 
      health-related quality of life, psychological health, and health-risk behaviors. 
      The confirmatory factorial analysis of the GVHR indicated an acceptable fit to 
      the 7-factor structure as proposed for the North American population. Emotional 
      intelligence and independence factors had low internal consistency, therefore, a 
      five-factor model was tenable in the Spanish population. Sex scalar invariance 
      was tenable, indicating that the factors latent means can be meaningfully 
      compared across sex. Univariate logistic regressions indicated that women 
      reported worse mental and physical health and more health limitations, but this 
      effect dissipated when gender variables were considered. Caregiver and work 
      strain stood out as the variables related to gender that predicted worse 
      health-related quality of life, psychological health, and health-risk behaviors. 
      In conclusion, factorial structure of the GVHR may differ from one culture to 
      another. Additionally, the variables related to gender in the GVHR give a better 
      account of the differences in health compared to biological sex.

TI  - Electrophysiological signatures of visual temporal processing deficits in 
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - e14447
LID - 10.1111/psyp.14447 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 
      reading ability despite normal intelligence and education. In search of core 
      deficits, previous evidence has linked DD with impairments in temporal aspects of 
      perceptual processing, which might underlie phonological deficits as well as 
      inefficient graphemic parsing during reading. However, electrophysiological 
      evidence for atypical temporal processing in DD is still scarce in the visual 
      modality. Here, we investigated the efficiency of both temporal segregation and 
      integration of visual information by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). We 
      confirmed previous evidence of a selective segregation deficit in dyslexia for 
      stimuli presented in rapid succession (<80 ms), despite unaffected integration 
      performance. Importantly, we found a reduced N1 amplitude in DD, a component 
      related to the allocation of attentional resources, which was independent of task 
      demands (i.e., evident in both segregation and integration). In addition, the P3 
      amplitude, linked to working memory and processing load, was modulated by task 
      demands in controls but not in individuals with DD. These results suggest that 
      atypical attentional sampling in dyslexia might weaken the quality of information 
      stored in visual working memory, leading to behavioral and electrophysiological 
      signatures of atypical temporal segregation. These results are consistent with 
      some existing theories of dyslexia, such as the magnocellular theory and the 
      "Sluggish Attentional Shifting" framework, and represent novel evidence for 
      neural correlates of decreased visual temporal resolution in DD.

PG  - 14653125231203743
LID - 10.1177/14653125231203743 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) in treatment planning 
      and outcome prediction in orthognathic treatment (OGT) has not been 
      systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of AI in treatment 
      planning and soft tissue outcome prediction in OGT. DESIGN: Systematic review. 
      DATA SOURCES: Unrestricted search of indexed databases and reference lists of 
      included studies. DATA SELECTION: Clinical studies that addressed the focused 
      question 'Is AI useful for treatment planning and soft tissue outcome prediction 
      in OGT?' were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Study screening, selection and data 
      extraction were performed independently by two authors. The risk of bias (RoB) 
      was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RoB and ROBINS-I tools for 
      randomised and non-randomised clinical studies, respectively. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      Eight clinical studies (seven retrospective cohort studies and one randomised 
      controlled study) were included. Four studies assessed the role of AI for 
      treatment decision making; and four studies assessed the accuracy of AI in soft 
      tissue outcome prediction after OGT. In four studies, the level of agreement 
      between AI and non-AI decision making was found to be clinically acceptable (at 
      least 90%). In four studies, it was shown that AI can be used for soft tissue 
      outcome prediction after OGT; however, predictions were not clinically acceptable 
      for the lip and chin areas. All studies had a low to moderate RoB. LIMITATIONS: 
      Due to high methodological inconsistencies among the included studies, it was not 
      possible to conduct a meta-analysis and reporting biases assessment. CONCLUSION: 
      AI can be a useful aid to traditional treatment planning by facilitating clinical 
      treatment decision making and providing a visualisation tool for soft tissue 
      outcome prediction in OGT. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022366864.

TI  - Abnormal functional connectivity in radiologically isolated syndrome: A 
      resting-state fMRI study.
PG  - 1393-1405

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) patients might have 
      psychiatric and cognitive deficits, which suggests an involvement of major 
      resting-state functional networks. Notwithstanding, very little is known about 
      the neural networks involved in RIS. OBJECTIVE: To examine functional 
      connectivity differences between RIS and healthy controls using resting-state 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Resting-state fMRI data in 
      25 RIS patients and 28 healthy controls were analyzed using an independent 
      component analysis; in addition, seed-based correlation analysis was used to 
      obtain more information about specific differences in the functional connectivity 
      of resting-state networks. Participants also underwent neuropsychological 
      testing. RESULTS: RIS patients did not differ from the healthy controls regarding 
      age, sex, and years of education. However, in memory (verbal and visuospatial) 
      and executive functions, RIS patients' cognitive performance was significantly 
      worse than the healthy controls. In addition, fluid intelligence was also 
      affected. Twelve out of 25 (48%) RIS patients failed at least one cognitive test, 
      and six (24.0%) had cognitive impairment. Compared to healthy controls, RIS 
      patients showed higher functional connectivity between the default mode network 
      and the right middle and superior frontal gyri and between the central executive 
      network and the right thalamus (p(FDR) < 0.05; corrected). In addition, the 
      seed-based correlation analysis revealed that RIS patients presented higher 
      functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex, an important hub 
      in neural networks, and the right precuneus. CONCLUSION: RIS patients had 
      abnormal brain connectivity in major resting-state neural networks and worse 
      performance in neurocognitive tests. This entity should be considered not an 
      "incidental finding" but an exclusively non-motor (neurocognitive) variant of 
      multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Thirty years of emotional intelligence: A scoping review of emotional 
      intelligence training programme among nurses.
PG  - 37-51
LID - 10.1111/inm.13235 [doi]
AB  - The stressful environment of any healthcare setting can be detrimental to nurses' 
      mental and emotional health. In recent years, emotional intelligence (EI) has 
      emerged as a vital psychological resource that positively impacts mental and 
      emotional health and improves organizational functioning and success. This 
      scoping review aimed to collate, synthesize and outline the research conducted on 
      EI training programmes among nurses to assess their effectiveness in improving 
      staff nurses' EI. Electronic databases of MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, 
      Cochrane, ProQuest, Embase and Web of Science were comprehensively searched for 
      related studies published between 1990 and 2021 (updated in May 2022). Two 
      investigators independently screened the abstracts of the retrieved studies 
      against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Out of 728 initially retrieved 
      studies, only 7 were included in the final synthesis. The PRISMA-ScR (2018) 
      checklist was used to report the study findings. All the studies included in the 
      review reported a significant improvement in nurses' EI after a training 
      programme. The results also indicate that EI interventions are an effective way 
      to improve nurses' psychological resources (improve resilience and coping skills; 
      reduce anxiety and stress), leadership qualities, job performance and patient 
      experience of nursing care. As nurses are exposed to a wide range of emotions, 
      human pain and suffering, the results of this review suggest that improving the 
      EI skills of nurses through short training programmes is an effective way to 
      maintain their emotional and mental well-being. This scoping review is 
      preregistered in Prospero (CRD42020161084).

TI  - Application of artificial intelligence in colorectal cancer screening by 
      colonoscopy: Future prospects (Review).
LID - 199 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/or.2023.8636 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a severe global health concern, with the 
      third‑high incidence and second‑high mortality rate of all cancers. The burden of 
      CRC is expected to surge to 60% by 2030. Fortunately, effective early 
      evidence‑based screening could significantly reduce the incidence and mortality 
      of CRC. Colonoscopy is the core screening method for CRC with high popularity and 
      accuracy. Yet, the accuracy of colonoscopy in CRC screening is related to the 
      experience and state of operating physicians. It is challenging to maintain the 
      high CRC diagnostic rate of colonoscopy. Artificial intelligence (AI)‑assisted 
      colonoscopy will compensate for the above shortcomings and improve the accuracy, 
      efficiency, and quality of colonoscopy screening. The unique advantages of AI, 
      such as the continuous advancement of high‑performance computing capabilities and 
      innovative deep‑learning architectures, which hugely impact the control of 
      colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality expectancy, highlight its role in 
      colonoscopy screening.
