TI  - Generation of a Melanoma and Nevus Data Set From Unstandardized Clinical 
      Photographs on the Internet.
PG  - 1223-1231
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2023.3521 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Artificial intelligence (AI) training for diagnosing dermatologic 
      images requires large amounts of clean data. Dermatologic images have different 
      compositions, and many are inaccessible due to privacy concerns, which hinder the 
      development of AI. OBJECTIVE: To build a training data set for discriminative and 
      generative AI from unstandardized internet images of melanoma and nevus. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this diagnostic study, a total of 5619 (CAN5600 
      data set) and 2006 (CAN2000 data set; a manually revised subset of CAN5600) 
      cropped lesion images of either melanoma or nevus were semiautomatically 
      annotated from approximately 500 000 photographs on the internet using 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs), region-based CNNs, and large mask 
      inpainting. For unsupervised pretraining, 132 673 possible lesions (LESION130k 
      data set) were also created with diversity by collecting images from 18 482 
      websites in approximately 80 countries. A total of 5000 synthetic images (GAN5000 
      data set) were generated using the generative adversarial network (StyleGAN2-ADA; 
      training, CAN2000 data set; pretraining, LESION130k data set). MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for 
      determining malignant neoplasms was analyzed. In each test, 1 of the 7 
      preexisting public data sets (total of 2312 images; including Edinburgh, an SNU 
      subset, Asan test, Waterloo, 7-point criteria evaluation, PAD-UFES-20, and 
      MED-NODE) was used as the test data set. Subsequently, a comparative study was 
      conducted between the performance of the EfficientNet Lite0 CNN on the proposed 
      data set and that trained on the remaining 6 preexisting data sets. RESULTS: The 
      EfficientNet Lite0 CNN trained on the annotated or synthetic images achieved 
      higher or equivalent mean (SD) AUROCs to the EfficientNet Lite0 trained using the 
      pathologically confirmed public data sets, including CAN5600 (0.874 [0.042]; 
      P = .02), CAN2000 (0.848 [0.027]; P = .08), and GAN5000 (0.838 [0.040]; P = .31 
      [Wilcoxon signed rank test]) and the preexisting data sets 
      combined (0.809 [0.063]) by the benefits of increased size of the training data 
      set. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The synthetic data set in this diagnostic study 
      was created using various AI technologies from internet images. A neural network 
      trained on the created data set (CAN5600) performed better than the same network 
      trained on preexisting data sets combined. Both the annotated (CAN5600 and 
      LESION130k) and synthetic (GAN5000) data sets could be shared for AI training and 
      consensus between physicians.

TI  - Can ChatGPT Provide Quality Information on Integrative Oncology? A Brief Report.
LID - 10.1089/jicm.2023.0290 [doi]
AB  - This short report evaluated the accuracy and quality of information provided by 
      ChatGPT regarding the use of complementary and integrative medicine for cancer. 
      Using the QUality Evaluation Scoring Tool, a panel of 12 reviewers assessed 
      ChatGPT's responses to 8 questions. The study found that ChatGPT provided 
      moderate-quality responses that were relatively unbiased and not misleading. 
      However, the chatbot's inability to reference specific scientific studies was a 
      significant limitation. Patients with cancer should not rely on ChatGPT for 
      clinical advice until further systematic validation. Future studies should 
      examine how patients perceive ChatGPT's information and its impact on 
      communication with health care professionals.

TI  - A Fully Automatic Estimation of Tear Meniscus Height Using Artificial 
      Intelligence.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1167/iovs.64.13.7 [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - PURPOSE: Accurate quantification measurement of tear meniscus is vital for the 
      precise diagnosis of dry eye. In current clinical practice, the measurement of 
      tear meniscus height (TMH) relies on doctors' manual operation. This study aims 
      to propose a novel automatic artificial intelligence (AI) system to evaluate TMH. 
      METHODS: A total of 510 photographs obtained by the oculus camera were labeled. 
      Three thousand and five hundred images were finally attained by data enhancement 
      to train the neural network model parameters, and 60 were used to evaluate the 
      model performance in segmenting the cornea and tear meniscus region. One hundred 
      images were used to test generalization ability of the model. We modified a 
      segmentation model of the cornea and the tear meniscus based on the UNet-like 
      network. The output of the segmentation model is followed by a calculation module 
      that calculates and reports the TMH. RESULTS: Compared with ground truth (GT) 
      manually labeled by clinicians, our modified model achieved a Dice Similarity 
      Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over union (Iou) of 0.99/0.98 in the corneal 
      segmentation task and 0.92/0.86 for the detection of tear meniscus on the 
      validation set, respectively. On the test set, the TMH automatically measured by 
      our AI system strongly correlates with the results manually calculated by the 
      ophthalmologists. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a fully automated and reliable AI 
      system to obtain TMH. After large-scale clinical testing, our method could be 
      used for dry eye screening in clinical practice.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in Sudden Cardiac 
      Arrest Prediction and Management: A Comprehensive Review.
PG  - 1391-1396
LID - 10.1007/s11886-023-01964-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive 
      overview of the recent advances in prediction models and the deployment of AI and 
      ML in the prediction of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) success. The 
      objectives are to understand the role of AI and ML in healthcare, specifically in 
      medical diagnosis, statistics, and precision medicine, and to explore their 
      applications in predicting and managing sudden cardiac arrest outcomes, 
      especially in the context of prehospital emergency care. RECENT FINDINGS: The 
      role of AI and ML in healthcare is expanding, with applications evident in 
      medical diagnosis, statistics, and precision medicine. Deep learning is gaining 
      prominence in radiomics and population health for disease risk prediction. 
      There's a significant focus on the integration of AI and ML in prehospital 
      emergency care, particularly in using ML algorithms for predicting outcomes in 
      COVID-19 patients and enhancing the recognition of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
      (OHCA). Furthermore, the combination of AI with automated external defibrillators 
      (AEDs) shows potential in better detecting shockable rhythms during cardiac 
      arrest incidents. AI and ML hold immense promise in revolutionizing the 
      prediction and management of sudden cardiac arrest, hinting at improved survival 
      rates and more efficient healthcare interventions in the future. Sudden cardiac 
      arrest (SCA) continues to be a major global cause of death, with survival rates 
      remaining low despite advanced first responder systems. The ongoing challenge is 
      the prediction and prevention of SCA. However, with the rise in the adoption of 
      AI and ML tools in clinical electrophysiology in recent times, there is optimism 
      about addressing these challenges more effectively.

AB  - Atherosclerosis remains the main cause of death worldwide. Most important issues 
      concerning atherosclerosis are hemodynamics and how it affects plaque prevalence 
      and distribution, as well as the symmetry and asymmetry of vasculature and 
      plaques. To present the symmetry in the vascular system an analysis of PubMed and 
      MEDLINE databases was performed. As of February 21, 2023, the results were as 
      follows: for "symmetry" AND "atherosclerosis" there were 47 results; for 
      "symmetry" AND "atherosclerotic lesions" - 20 results; for "symmetry" AND "artery 
      stenosis" - 82 results; for "asymmetry" AND "atherosclerosis" - 87 results. Not 
      without meaning are preventive measures. In the light of the Fourth Industrial 
      Revolution artificial intelligence (AI) solutions help to develop new tools 
      outperforming already existing cardiovascular risk scales. The aim of this paper 
      is to present a current view on symmetry within vasculature and atherosclerosis 
      as well as present a new approach to assess individuals' cardiovascular risk in 
      accordance with precision medicine assumptions. Symmetry and asymmetry within the 
      human vascular system play a crucial role in understanding of arterial diseases, 
      including atherosclerosis. Moreover, it is unavoidable to use AI in 
      cardiovascular risk stratification. Int J Occup Med Environ Health.

AB  - Serial crystallography experiments at X-ray free-electron laser facilities 
      produce massive amounts of data but only a fraction of these data are useful for 
      downstream analysis. Thus, it is essential to differentiate between acceptable 
      and unacceptable data, generally known as 'hit' and 'miss', respectively. Image 
      classification methods from artificial intelligence, or more specifically 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs), classify the data into hit and miss 
      categories in order to achieve data reduction. The quantitative performance 
      established in previous work indicates that CNNs successfully classify serial 
      crystallography data into desired categories [Ke, Brewster, Yu, Ushizima, Yang & 
      Sauter (2018). J. Synchrotron Rad.25, 655-670], but no qualitative evidence on 
      the internal workings of these networks has been provided. For example, there are 
      no visualization methods that highlight the features contributing to a specific 
      prediction while classifying data in serial crystallography experiments. 
      Therefore, existing deep learning methods, including CNNs classifying serial 
      crystallography data, are like a 'black box'. To this end, presented here is a 
      qualitative study to unpack the internal workings of CNNs with the aim of 
      visualizing information in the fundamental blocks of a standard network with 
      serial crystallography data. The region(s) or part(s) of an image that mostly 
      contribute to a hit or miss prediction are visualized.

TI  - The Effects of Various Teaching Methods on Chest X-ray Interpretation Skills 
      Among Medical Students and Interns: A Systematic Review.

AB  - Chest X-ray (CXR) is a common tool used in medical practice. Medical students and 
      interns should acquire knowledge of CXR interpretation, as it is an essential 
      diagnostic tool for a large spectrum of diseases. This systematic review aimed to 
      compare the effect of different intervention techniques on the competency of 
      medical students and interns to demonstrate the level of confidence and 
      competence in interpreting common presentations of CXRs. The population, 
      intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) framework was used to formulate the 
      review question. All related articles in five databases (PubMed, Web of Science, 
      Scopus, Medline, and Embase) were retrieved and the search was completed in March 
      2023 with no limiters on date and time. The number of relevant studies was 469. A 
      multi-level approach through the Rayyan platform was used for the screening and 
      exclusion processes. Eleven articles were included in the systematic review 
      consisting of eight randomized controlled trials, one quasi-experimental study, 
      one cross-sectional study, and one interventional cohort. Results showed 
      significant effects of teaching methods utilizing deductive or inductive 
      approach, clinical history, patient care comfort survey, and SAFMEDS 
      (Say-All-Fast-Minute-Every-Day-Shuffled). Contrarily, no significant effect was 
      shown by flipped classroom models and mixed and blocked practice, peer-assisted 
      learning vs. expert-assisted learning, and Chester, an artificial intelligence 
      tool. This review identified beneficial approaches that may enhance the learning 
      outcomes of interpreting CXRs for medical students and interns, highlighting the 
      remarkable impact of SAFMEDS on medical students' ability to identify CXR 
      findings as well as the availability and practicality of online and e-learning 
      resources for students.
