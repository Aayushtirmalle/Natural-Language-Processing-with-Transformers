AB  - Developing an artificial visual sensory system requires optoelectronic materials 
      and devices that can mimic the behavior of biological synapses. Organic/polymeric 
      semiconductors have emerged as promising candidates for optoelectronic synapses 
      due to their tunable optoelectronic properties, mechanic flexibility, and 
      biological compatibility. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in 
      organic optoelectronic synaptic materials and devices, including their design 
      principles, working mechanisms, and applications. We also highlight the 
      challenges and opportunities in this field and provide insights into potential 
      applications of these materials and devices in next-generation artificial visual 
      systems. By leveraging the advances in organic optoelectronic materials and 
      devices, we can envision its future development in artificial intelligence.

AB  - Sleep deprivation is quite frequent in military during combat, intelligence 
      gathering or peacekeeping operations. Even one night of sleep deprivation leads 
      to accumulation of amyloid beta peptide burden that would lead to precipitation 
      of Alzheimer's disease over the years. Thus, efforts are needed to slow down or 
      neutralize accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (AβP) and associated Alzheimer's 
      disease brain pathology including phosphorylated tau (p-tau) within the brain 
      fluid environment. Sleep deprivation also alters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 
      metabolism in the brain microenvironment and impair upregulation of several 
      neurotrophic factors. Thus, blockade or neutralization of AβP, p-tau and 
      serotonin in sleep deprivation may attenuate brain pathology. In this 
      investigation this hypothesis is examined using nanodelivery of cerebrolysin- a 
      balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors and active peptide fragments 
      together with monoclonal antibodies against AβP, p-tau and serotonin 
      (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). Our observations suggest that sleep deprivation 
      induced pathophysiology is significantly reduced following nanodelivery of 
      cerebrolysin together with monoclonal antibodies to AβP, p-tau and 5-HT, not 
      reported earlier.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We propose a novel approach that uses spatial walking patterns 
      produced by real-time location systems to classify the severity of cognitive 
      impairment (CI) among residents of a memory care unit. METHODS: Each participant 
      was classified as "No-CI", "Mild-Moderate CI" or "Severe CI" based on their 
      Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The location data was distributed into 
      windows of various durations (5, 10, 15 and 30 min) and transformed into images 
      used to train a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) at each window size. 
      Class Activation Mapping was applied to the top-performing models to determine 
      the features of images associated with each class. RESULTS: The best performing 
      model achieved an accuracy of 87.38 % (30-min window length) with an overall 
      pattern that larger window sizes perform better. The class activation maps were 
      effectively consolidated into a Cognitive Impairment Classification Value (CICV) 
      score that distinguishes between No-CI, Mild-Moderate CI, and Severe CI. 
      CONCLUSION: The class activation maps show that the CNN made relevant and 
      intuitive distinctions for paths corresponding to each class. Future work should 
      validate the proposed techniques with participants who are well-characterized 
      clinically, over larger and diversified settings, and towards classification of 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms such as motor agitation, mood, or apathy.

AB  - Perioperative monitoring of cardiac function is beneficial for early detection of 
      cardiovascular complications. The standard of care for cardiac monitoring 
      performed by trained cardiologists and anesthesiologists involves a manual and 
      qualitative evaluation of ultrasound imaging, which is a time-demanding and 
      resource-intensive process with intraobserver- and interobserver variability. In 
      practice, such measures can only be performed a limited number of times during 
      the intervention. To overcome these difficulties, this study presents a robust 
      method for automatic and quantitative monitoring of cardiac function based on 3D 
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) B-mode ultrasound recordings of the left 
      ventricle (LV). Such an assessment obtains consistent measurements and can 
      produce a near real-time evaluation of ultrasound imagery. Hence, the presented 
      method is time-saving and results in increased accessibility. The mitral annular 
      plane systolic excursion (MAPSE), characterizing global LV function, is estimated 
      by landmark detection and cardiac view classification of two-dimensional images 
      extracted along the long-axis of the ultrasound volume. MAPSE estimation directly 
      from 3D TEE recordings is beneficial since it removes the need for manual 
      acquisition of cardiac views, hence decreasing the need for interference by 
      physicians. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained and tested on 
      acquired ultrasound data of 107 patients, and MAPSE estimates were compared to 
      clinically obtained references in a blinded study including 31 patients. The 
      proposed method for automatic MAPSE estimation had low bias and low variability 
      in comparison to clinical reference measures. The method accomplished a mean 
      difference for MAPSE estimates of (-0.16±1.06) mm. Thus, the results did not show 
      significant systematic errors. The obtained bias and variance of the method were 
      comparable to inter-observer variability of clinically obtained MAPSE measures on 
      2D TTE echocardiography. The novel pipeline proposed in this study has the 
      potential to enhance cardiac monitoring in perioperative- and intensive care 
      settings.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) offers opportunities but also challenges for 
      biomedical research and healthcare. This position paper shares the results of the 
      international conference "Fair medicine and AI" (online 3-5 March 2021). Scholars 
      from science and technology studies (STS), gender studies, and ethics of science 
      and technology formulated opportunities, challenges, and research and development 
      desiderata for AI in healthcare. AI systems and solutions, which are being 
      rapidly developed and applied, may have undesirable and unintended consequences 
      including the risk of perpetuating health inequalities for marginalized groups. 
      Socially robust development and implications of AI in healthcare require urgent 
      investigation. There is a particular dearth of studies in human-AI interaction 
      and how this may best be configured to dependably deliver safe, effective and 
      equitable healthcare. To address these challenges, we need to establish diverse 
      and interdisciplinary teams equipped to develop and apply medical AI in a fair, 
      accountable and transparent manner. We formulate the importance of including 
      social science perspectives in the development of intersectionally beneficent and

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for effective and non-intrusive methods 
      to monitor the well-being of elderly individuals in their homes, especially for 
      early detection of potential viral infections. Conspicuously, the present paper 
      develops a Multi-scaled Long Short Term Memory (Ms-LSTM) model for the routine 
      health monitoring of elderly patients to detect COVID-19. The proposed method 
      offers home-based health diagnostics through urine analysis by leveraging the 
      IoT-Fog-Cloud paradigm. Mainly, the proposed model constitutes a four-layered 
      architecture: data acquisition, fog layer, cloud layer, and interface layer. Each 
      layer serves distinct functionalities and provides specific services, thereby 
      collectively enhancing the overall effectiveness of the model. The statistical 
      results of the study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Ms-LSTM 
      model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, including Artificial Neural 
      Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random 
      Forest, and LSTM. Further, the proposed model attains a mean temporal efficiency 
      of 39.23 seconds. It exhibits high reliability (92.97%), stability (70.06%), and 
      predictive accuracy (93.25%).

AB  - The efficient reabsorption of essential nutrients by epithelial cells in the 
      proximal tubule of the kidney is crucial for maintaining homeostasis. This 
      process relies heavily on a complex ecosystem of vesicular trafficking pathways. 
      At the center of this network, the lysosome plays a pivotal role in processing 
      incoming molecules, sensing nutrient availability, sorting receptors and 
      transporters, and balancing differentiation and proliferation in the tubular 
      epithelial cells. Disruptions in these fundamental processes can lead to proximal 
      tubulopathy-a condition characterized by the dysfunction of the tubular cells 
      followed by the presence of low-molecular-weight proteins and solutes in urine. 
      If left untreated, proximal tubulopathy can progress to chronic kidney disease 
      and severe complications. Functional studies of rare inherited disorders 
      affecting the proximal tubule have gleaned actionable insights into fundamental 
      mechanisms of homeostasis while revealing drug targets for therapeutic discovery 
      and development. In this mini review, we explore hereditary proximal 
      tubulopathies as a paradigm of kidney homeostasis disorders, discussing the 
      factors contributing to tubular dysfunction. In addition, we shed light on the 
      current landscape of drug discovery approaches used to identify actionable 
      targets and summarize the preclinical pipeline of potential therapeutic agents. 
      These efforts may ultimately lead to new treatment avenues for proximal 
      tubulopathies, which are currently inadequately tackled by existing therapies. 
      Through this article, our hope is to promote academia-industry partnerships and 
      advocate for research consortia that can accelerate the effective translation of 
      knowledge advances into innovative therapies addressing the huge unmet needs of 
      individuals with these debilitating diseases.

AB  - As data-driven science, artificial intelligence (AI) has paved a promising path 
      toward an evolving health system teeming with thrilling opportunities for 
      precision oncology. Notwithstanding the tremendous success of oncological AI in 
      such fields as lung carcinoma, breast tumor and brain malignancy, less attention 
      has been devoted to investigating the influence of AI on gynecologic oncology. 
      Hereby, this review sheds light on the ever-increasing contribution of 
      state-of-the-art AI techniques to the refined risk stratification and 
      whole-course management of patients with gynecologic tumors, in particular, 
      cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancer, centering on information and features 
      extracted from clinical data (electronic health records), cancer imaging 
      including radiological imaging, colposcopic images, cytological and 
      histopathological digital images, and molecular profiling (genomics, 
      transcriptomics, metabolomics and so forth). However, there are still noteworthy 
      challenges beyond performance validation. Thus, this work further describes the 
      limitations and challenges faced in the real-word implementation of AI models, as 
      well as potential solutions to address these issues.

AB  - The rapid decline in both quality and availability of freshwater resources on our 
      planet necessitates their thorough assessment to ensure sustainable usage. The 
      growing demand for water in industrial, agricultural, and domestic sectors poses 
      significant challenges to managing both surface and groundwater resources. This 
      study tests and proposes a hybrid evaluation approach to determine Groundwater 
      Quality Indices (GQIs) for irrigation (IRRI), seawater intrusion (SWI), and 
      potability (POT), finalized to the spatial distribution of groundwater 
      suitability involving water quality indicator along with hydrogeological and 
      socio-economic factors. Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Information Gain Ratio 
      (IGR) were used to state the importance of chosen factors such as level of 
      groundwater above the sea, thickness of the aquifer, land cover, distance from 
      coastline, silt soil content, recharge, distance from river and lagoons, depth to 
      water table from ground, distance from agricultural wells, hydraulic 
      conductivity, and lithology for each quality index, separately. The results of 
      both methods showed that recharge is the most important parameter for GQI(IRRI) 
      and GQI(POT), while the distance from the coastline and the rivers, are the most 
      important for GQI(SWI). The spatial modelling of GQI(IRRI) and GQI(POT) in the 
      study area has been achieved applying three machine learning (ML) algorithms: the 
      Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), the Random Forest (RF), and the Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM). Validation results showed that RF has the highest prediction for 
      GQI(IRRI), while the SVM model has the highest prediction for the GQI(POT) index. 
      It is worth to mention that the future utilization and testing of new algorithms 
      could produce even better results. Finally, GQI(IRRI) and GQI(POT) were combined 
      and compared using two combine and overlay methods to prepare a hybrid map of 
      multi-GQIs. The results showed that 69% of the study area is suitable for 
      irrigation and potable use, due to both geogenic and anthropogenic activities 
      which contribute to make some water resources unsuitable for either use. 
      Specifically, the northern, western, and eastern portions of the study area are 
      in the "very high and high quality" classes while the southern portion shows 
      "very low and low quality" classes. In conclusion, the developed map and approach 
      can serve as a practical guide for enhancing groundwater management, identifying 
      suitable areas for various uses and pinpointing regions requiring improved 
      management practices.

TI  - Suspected Bronchiectasis and Mortality in Adults With a History of Smoking Who 
      Have Normal and Impaired Lung Function : A Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) is associated with greater mortality. However, whether suspected 
      bronchiectasis-defined as incidental bronchiectasis on computed tomography (CT) 
      images plus clinical manifestation-is associated with increased mortality in 
      adults with a history of smoking with normal spirometry and preserved ratio 
      impaired spirometry (PRISm) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association 
      between suspected bronchiectasis and mortality in adults with normal spirometry, 
      PRISm, and obstructive spirometry. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort. 
      SETTING: The COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
      Disease) study. PARTICIPANTS: 7662 non-Hispanic Black or White adults, aged 45 to 
      80 years, with 10 or more pack-years of smoking history. Participants who were 
      former and current smokers were stratified into normal spirometry (n = 3277), 
      PRISm (n = 986), and obstructive spirometry (n = 3399). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Bronchiectasis identified by CT was ascertained using artificial 
      intelligence-based measurements of an airway-to-artery ratio (AAR) greater than 1 
      (AAR >1), a measure of bronchial dilatation. The primary outcome of "suspected 
      bronchiectasis" was defined as an AAR >1 of greater than 1% plus 2 of the 
      following: cough, phlegm, dyspnea, and history of 2 or more exacerbations. 
      RESULTS: Among the 7662 participants (mean age, 60 years; 52% women), 1352 
      (17.6%) had suspected bronchiectasis. During a median follow-up of 11 years, 2095 
      (27.3%) died. Ten-year mortality risk was higher in participants with suspected 
      bronchiectasis, compared with those without suspected bronchiectasis (normal 
      spirometry: difference in mortality probability [Pr], 0.15 [95% CI, 0.09 to 
      0.21]; PRISm: Pr, 0.07 [CI, -0.003 to 0.15]; obstructive spirometry: Pr, 0.06 
      [CI, 0.03 to 0.09]). When only CT was used to identify bronchiectasis, the 
      differences were attenuated in the normal spirometry (Pr, 0.04 [CI, -0.001 to 
      0.08]). LIMITATIONS: Only 2 racial groups were studied. Only 1 measurement was 
      used to define bronchiectasis on CT. Symptoms of suspected bronchiectasis were 
      nonspecific. CONCLUSION: Suspected bronchiectasis was associated with a 
      heightened risk for mortality in adults with normal and obstructive spirometry.
