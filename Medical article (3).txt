AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in many areas of social 
      life is becoming widespread. The advantages of AI are being observed in medicine, 
      commerce, automobiles, customer service, agriculture and production in factory 
      settings, among others. Workers first encountered robots in the work environment 
      in the 1960s. Since then, intelligent systems have become much more advanced. The 
      expansion of AI functionality in the work environment exacerbates human health 
      risks. These can be physical (lack of adequate machine control, accidents) or 
      psychological (technostress, fear, automation leading to job exclusion, changes 
      in the labour market, widening social differences). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      purpose of this article is to identify, based on selected literature, possible 
      applications of AI and the potential benefits and risks for humans. RESULTS: The 
      main area of interest was the contemporary work environment and the health 
      consequences associated with access to smart technologies. A key research area 
      for us was the relationship between AI and increased worker control. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In the article, the authors emphasize the importance of relevant EU legislation 
      that guarantees respect for the rights of the employed. The authors put forward 
      the thesis that the new reality with the widespread use of AI, requires an 
      analysis of its impact on the human psycho-social and health situation. Thus, a 
      legal framework defining the scope of monitoring and collection of sensitive data 
      is necessary. Med Pr. 2023;74(3):227-33.

LID - 7521
AB  - Nowadays, emotional intelligence is not only understood as the recognition of our 
      own emotions but also the regulation of these emotions. In the field of sports, 
      the concept of sports leadership is increasingly relevant, understood as a 
      behavioral and cognitive process closely related to sports success, based on 
      interpersonal relationships, trust, respect and the feeling of coherence. In this 
      study, we intend to analyze the relationship between sports success and emotional 
      intelligence to verify their relationship and the influence of other variables 
      such as sports anxiety. As a sample, we took a total of 165 active sportsmen and 
      women studying for both undergraduate and master's degrees related to the 
      sciences of physical activity and sport. The expected results aim to demonstrate 
      the relationship between emotional intelligence, sports leadership and sports 
      anxiety.

PG  - 61-67
LID - 10.1007/s42977-023-00153-8 [doi]
AB  - Genomes of most RNA viruses are rarely larger than the size of an average human 
      gene (10-15 kb) and still code for a number of biologically active polypeptides 
      that modify the immune system and metabolism of the host organism in an amazingly 
      complex way. Prolonged coevolution developed tricks by which viruses can dodge 
      many protective mechanisms of the host and lead to the formation of molecular 
      mimicry patterns. Some viruses inhibit the interferon response, interfere with 
      the membrane destroying effects of the activated complement cascade. They can 
      replicate in cellular compartments formed by inner membranes of the cell hiding 
      their characteristic features from diverse pattern recognition receptors. In many 
      cases-and in this respect, the new coronavirus is a champion-they can exploit our 
      own defensive mechanisms to cause serious harm, severe symptoms and frequently 
      deadly disease.

TI  - Cross-cultural differences in visuo-spatial processing and the culture-fairness 
      of visuo-spatial intelligence tests: an integrative review and a model for 
      matrices tasks.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s41235-021-00350-w [doi]
LID - 11
AB  - Visuo-spatial reasoning tests, such as Raven's matrices, Cattell's culture-fair 
      test, or various subtests of the Wechsler scales, are frequently used to estimate 
      intelligence scores in the context of inter-racial comparisons. This has led to 
      several high-profile works claiming that certain ethnic groups have lower 
      intelligence than others, presumably due to genetic inferiority. This logic is 
      predicated on the assumption that such visuo-spatial tests, because they are 
      non-verbal, must be culture-fair: that their solution process does not 
      significantly draw on factors that vary from one culture to the next. This 
      assumption of culture-fairness is dubious at best and has been questioned by many 
      authors. In this article, I review the substantial body of psychological and 
      ethnographic literature which has demonstrated that the perception, manipulation 
      and conceptualization of visuo-spatial information differs significantly across 
      cultures, in a way that is relevant to intelligence tests. I then outline a model 
      of how these inter-cultural differences can affect seven major steps of the 
      solution process for Raven's matrices, with a brief discussion of other 
      visuo-spatial reasoning tests. Overall, a number of cultural assumptions appear 
      to be deeply ingrained in all visuo-spatial reasoning tests, to the extent that 
      it disqualifies the view of such tests as intrinsically culture-fair and makes it 
      impossible to draw clear-cut conclusions from average score differences between 
      ethnic groups.

PG  - e0270255

LID - e0270255
AB  - The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is filled with hype and inflated 
      expectations. Notwithstanding, AI is finding its way into numerous aspects of 
      humanity including the fast-growing helping profession of coaching. Coaching has 
      been shown to be efficacious in a variety of human development facets. The 
      application of AI in a narrow, specific area of coaching has also been shown to 
      work. What remains uncertain, is how the two compare. In this paper we compare 
      two equivalent longitudinal randomised control trial studies that measured the 
      increase in clients' goal attainment as a result of having received coaching over 
      a 10-month period. The first study involved human coaches and the replication 
      study used an AI chatbot coach. In both studies, human coaches and the AI coach 
      were significantly more effective in helping clients reach their goals compared 
      to the two control groups. Surprisingly however, the AI coach was as effective as 
      human coaches at the end of the trials. We interpret this result using AI and 
      goal theory and present three significant implications: AI coaching could be 
      scaled to democratize coaching; AI coaching could grow the demand for human 
      coaching; and AI could replace human coaches who use simplistic, model-based 
      coaching approaches. At present, AI's lack of empathy and emotional intelligence 
      make human coaches irreplicable. However, understanding the efficacy of AI 
      coaching relative to human coaching may promote the focused use of AI, to the 
      significant benefit of society.

LID - 346
AB  - The role of genetics in determining measured differences in mean IQ between 
      putative racial groups has been a focus of intense discussion and disagreement 
      for more than 50 years. While the last several decades of research have 
      definitively demonstrated that genetic variation can influence measures of 
      cognitive function, the inferences drawn by some participants in the controversy 
      regarding the implications of these findings for racial differences in cognitive 
      ability are highly dubious. Of equal importance, there is no compelling 
      scientific rationale for focusing on and devoting substantial effort to 
      determining mean differences in intelligence or other cognitive functions between 
      groups with incompletely defined and dynamic (and therefore not definitively 
      definable) boundaries.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph17217785 [doi]
LID - 7785
AB  - The strength named "social intelligence" in the Values in Action (VIA) 
      Classification of Character Strengths and Virtues represents emotional, personal, 
      and social intelligences, which are considered "hot intelligences". This work 
      contributed to the study of the mechanisms of influence of social intelligence on 
      mental health. A multiple mediation model was proposed to quantify the direct 
      effect of social intelligence on psychopathological symptoms, as well as its 
      indirect effect through its impact on components of subjective and psychological 
      well-being. This study involved 1407 university students who completed the Values 
      in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale 
      (SWLS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Psychological 
      Well-Being Scales (PWBS), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Social 
      intelligence was found to be significantly associated with life satisfaction (a = 
      0.33, p < 0.001), positive affect (a = 0.42, p < 0.001), and negative affect (a = 
      -0.21, p < 0.001), transmitting significant indirect effects on 
      psychopathological symptomatology through these components of subjective 
      well-being. Likewise, social intelligence was positively and significantly 
      related to psychological well-being (a-paths ranged from 0.31 to 0.43, p < 
      0.001), exerting significant and negative indirect effects on psychological 
      distress through the dimension of positive relations with other people. These 
      results could be useful in order to expand the explanatory models of the 
      influence of social intelligence on mental health and to design interventions 
      based on this strength for the promotion of well-being and the reduction in 
      psychological distress.

AB  - The associations between higher intelligence test scores from early life and 
      later good health, fewer illnesses, and longer life are recent discoveries. 
      Researchers are mapping the extent of these associations and trying to 
      understanding them. Part of the intelligence-health association has genetic 
      origins. Recent advances in molecular genetic technology and statistical analyses 
      have revealed that: intelligence and many health outcomes are highly polygenic; 
      and that modest but widespread genetic correlations exist between intelligence 
      and health, illness and mortality. Causal accounts of intelligence-health 
      associations are still poorly understood. The contribution of education and 
      socio-economic status - both of which are partly genetic in origin - to the 
      intelligence-health associations are being explored.

AB  - Objective. Pharmacists must be equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes 
      necessary to provide culturally intelligent and patient-centered care; however, 
      most are not trained to do so. In order to prepare culturally intelligent 
      pharmacists, standards and curricula for cultural intelligence must be defined 
      and implemented within pharmacy education. The objective of this study was to 
      create a cultural intelligence framework (CIF) for pharmacy education and 
      determine its alignment with Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) training.Methods. An 
      extensive literature analysis on current methods of cultural intelligence 
      education was used to construct a CIF, which integrates leading models of 
      cultural intelligence in health care education with Bloom's Taxonomy. Five 
      student focus groups were conducted to explore and map their cultural experiences 
      to the CIF. All focus groups were recorded, transcribed, deidentified and 
      deductively coded using the CIF.Results. The four CIF domains (awareness, 
      knowledge, practice, desire) were observed in all five focus groups; however, not 
      every participant expressed each domain when sharing their experiences. Most 
      students expressed cultural awareness, knowledge, and desire, however, only a few 
      students discussed cultural practice. Participant comments regarding their 
      experiences differed by race and year in the curriculum.Conclusion. This study 
      was a first step toward understanding cultural intelligence education and 
      experiences in pharmacy. The CIF represents an evidence-based approach to 
      cultural intelligence training that can help prepare pharmacy learners to be 
      socially responsible health care practitioners.

AB  - The world economy is developing rapidly. Behind the rapid development, the 
      management of economic regions is very important. In the process of economic 
      management, the government plays the role of macrocontrol and is responsible for 
      the management of various economic affairs and social and economic services. 
      While undertaking infrastructure construction, it creates a good environment for 
      economic development. However, with the deepening of economic development and the 
      more and more complex economic data, the current economic management has 
      gradually exposed a range of issues that arise during the process of economic 
      development, and these problems need to be solved urgently. At this time, the 
      application scope of artificial intelligence in the economic field is getting 
      wider and wider, and it has a great positive effect on economic development. 
      Therefore, in order to solve the problem of economic management in the process of 
      economic development, this paper proposes a development path that integrates AI 
      and economic management and provides intelligent technology support for the 
      development of economic management to help the smooth operation of economic 
      development. In addition, this paper shows through experiments that the path of 
      integration of AI and economic management can promote the development and smooth 
      operation of the economy, and AI has a positive impact on economic management.
