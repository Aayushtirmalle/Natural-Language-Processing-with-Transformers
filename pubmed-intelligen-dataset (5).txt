AB  - Artificial intelligence recommendations are sometimes erroneous and biased. In 
      our research, we hypothesized that people who perform a (simulated) medical 
      diagnostic task assisted by a biased AI system will reproduce the model's bias in 
      their own decisions, even when they move to a context without AI support. In 
      three experiments, participants completed a medical-themed classification task 
      with or without the help of a biased AI system. The biased recommendations by the 
      AI influenced participants' decisions. Moreover, when those participants, 
      assisted by the AI, moved on to perform the task without assistance, they made 
      the same errors as the AI had made during the previous phase. Thus, participants' 
      responses mimicked AI bias even when the AI was no longer making suggestions. 
      These results provide evidence of human inheritance of AI bias.

AB  - Computer-assisted systems are becoming broadly used in medicine. In endoscopy, 
      most research focuses on the automatic detection of polyps or other pathologies, 
      but localization and navigation of the endoscope are completely performed 
      manually by physicians. To broaden this research and bring spatial Artificial 
      Intelligence to endoscopies, data from complete procedures is needed. This paper 
      introduces the Endomapper dataset, the first collection of complete endoscopy 
      sequences acquired during regular medical practice, making secondary use of 
      medical data. Its main purpose is to facilitate the development and evaluation of 
      Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods in real endoscopy 
      data. The dataset contains more than 24 hours of video. It is the first 
      endoscopic dataset that includes endoscope calibration as well as the original 
      calibration videos. Meta-data and annotations associated with the dataset vary 
      from the anatomical landmarks, procedure labeling, segmentations, 
      reconstructions, simulated sequences with ground truth and same patient 
      procedures. The software used in this paper is publicly available.

AB  - Automating retrosynthesis with artificial intelligence expedites organic 
      chemistry research in digital laboratories. However, most existing deep-learning 
      approaches are hard to explain, like a "black box" with few insights. Here, we 
      propose RetroExplainer, formulizing the retrosynthesis task into a molecular 
      assembly process, containing several retrosynthetic actions guided by deep 
      learning. To guarantee a robust performance of our model, we propose three units: 
      a multi-sense and multi-scale Graph Transformer, structure-aware contrastive 
      learning, and dynamic adaptive multi-task learning. The results on 12 large-scale 
      benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RetroExplainer, which 
      outperforms the state-of-the-art single-step retrosynthesis approaches. In 
      addition, the molecular assembly process renders our model with good 
      interpretability, allowing for transparent decision-making and quantitative 
      attribution. When extended to multi-step retrosynthesis planning, RetroExplainer 
      has identified 101 pathways, in which 86.9% of the single reactions correspond to 
      those already reported in the literature. As a result, RetroExplainer is expected 
      to offer valuable insights for reliable, high-throughput, and high-quality 
      organic synthesis in drug development.

AB  - At present, due to the rapid progress of treatment technology in the acute phase 
      of ischaemic stroke, the mortality of patients has been greatly reduced but the 
      number of disabled survivors is increasing, and most of them are elderly 
      patients. Physicians and rehabilitation therapists pay attention to develop all 
      kinds of therapist techniques including physical therapy techniques, 
      robot-assisted technology and artificial intelligence technology, and study the 
      molecular, cellular or synergistic mechanisms of rehabilitation therapies to 
      promote the effect of rehabilitation therapy. Here, we discussed different animal 
      and in vitro models of ischaemic stroke for rehabilitation studies; the compound 
      concept and technology of neurological rehabilitation; all kinds of biological 
      mechanisms of physical therapy; the significance, assessment and efficacy of 
      neurological rehabilitation; the application of brain-computer interface, 
      rehabilitation robotic and non-invasive brain stimulation technology in stroke 
      rehabilitation.

AB  - The prevention of water-borne diseases requires the disinfection of water 
      consumed. Disinfection by-products, however, are an increasing concern, and they 
      require advanced knowledge of water treatment plants before their release for 
      human consumption. In this study, multivariate non-linear regression (MNR) and 
      adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS: Grid partition - GP and 
      Sub-clustering - SC) integrated with particle swarm optimization (PSO) were 
      proposed for the prediction of haloacetic acids (HAAs) in actual distribution 
      systems. PSO-ANFIS-GP and PSO-ANFIS-SC were trained and verified for a total of 
      64 sets of data with eight parameters (pH, Temperature, UVA(254), DOC, Br(-); 
      NH(4)(+)-N; NO(2)(-)-N, residual free chlorine). With MNR, R(2) is 
      0.5184<R(2)<0.8181 and average absolute error, AAE = 0.172-0.253%). Further, 
      PSO-ANFIS-GP and PSO-ANFIS-SC for HAAs (BCAA, DCAA, TCAA, HAA5, and HAA9) 
      prediction consistently show higher regression coefficients, with lower AAE, 
      (0.8825< R(2) < 0.9363 and AAE = 0.1031-0.1499%) and (0.8826< R(2) < 0.9322 and 
      AAE = 0.1108-0.1500%) respectively with). With the eight simple parameters, 
      PSO-ANFIS-GP provides an easy way for users to monitor and predict HAAs.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of diabetes, high avoidable morbidity and mortality due 
      to diabetes and diabetic complications, and related substantial economic burden 
      make diabetes a significant health challenge worldwide. A shortage of diabetes 
      specialists, uneven distribution of medical resources, low adherence to 
      medications, and improper self-management contribute to poor glycemic control in 
      patients with diabetes. Recent advancements in digital health technologies, 
      especially artificial intelligence (AI), provide a significant opportunity to 
      achieve better efficiency in diabetes care, which may diminish the increase in 
      diabetes-related health-care expenditures. Here, we review the recent progress in 
      the application of AI in the management of diabetes and then discuss the 
      opportunities and challenges of AI application in clinical practice. Furthermore, 
      we explore the possibility of combining and expanding upon existing digital 
      health technologies to develop an AI-assisted digital health-care ecosystem that 
      includes the prevention and management of diabetes.

AB  - Metabolic disorders are increasingly prevalent worldwide, leading to high rates 
      of morbidity and mortality. The variety of metabolic illnesses can be addressed 
      through personalized medicine. The goal of personalized medicine is to give 
      doctors the ability to anticipate the best course of treatment for patients with 
      metabolic problems. By analyzing a patient's metabolomic, proteomic, genetic 
      profile, and clinical data, physicians can identify relevant diagnostic, and 
      predictive biomarkers and develop treatment plans and therapy for acute and 
      chronic metabolic diseases. To achieve this goal, real-time modeling of clinical 
      data and multiple omics is essential to pinpoint underlying biological 
      mechanisms, risk factors, and possibly useful data to promote early diagnosis and 
      prevention of complex diseases. Incorporating cutting-edge technologies like 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning is crucial for consolidating diverse 
      forms of data, examining multiple variables, establishing databases of clinical 
      indicators to aid decision-making, and formulating ethical protocols to address 
      concerns. This review article aims to explore the potential of personalized 
      medicine utilizing omics approaches for the treatment of metabolic disorders. It 
      focuses on the recent advancements in genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, 
      metabolomics, and nutrigenomics, emphasizing their role in revolutionizing 
      personalized medicine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify and review key research advances from the literature 
      published between 2019 and 2023 on the diagnosis and microbiology of otitis media 
      (OM) including acute otitis media (AOM), recurrent AOM (rAOM), otitis media with 
      effusion (OME), chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and AOM complications 
      (mastoiditis). DATA SOURCES: PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine. 
      REVIEW METHODS: All relevant original articles published in Medline in English 
      between July 2019 and February 2023 were identified. Studies that were reviews, 
      case studies, relating to OM complications (other than mastoiditis), and studies 
      focusing on guideline adherence, and consensus statements were excluded. Members 
      of the panel drafted the report based on these search results. MAIN FINDINGS: For 
      the diagnosis section, 2294 unique records screened, 55 were eligible for 
      inclusion. For the microbiology section 705 unique records were screened and 137 
      articles were eligible for inclusion. The main themes that arose in OM diagnosis 
      were the need to incorporate multiple modalities including video-otoscopy, 
      tympanometry, telemedicine and artificial intelligence for accurate diagnoses in 
      all diagnostic settings. Further to this, was the use of new, cheap, readily 
      available tools which may improve access in rural and lowmiddle income (LMIC) 
      settings. For OM aetiology, PCR remains the most sensitive method for detecting 
      middle ear pathogens with microbiome analysis still largely restricted to 
      research use. The global pandemic response reduced rates of OM in children, but 
      post-pandemic shifts should be monitored. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE AND FUTURE 
      RESEARCH: Cheap, easy to use multi-technique assessments combined with artificial 
      intelligence and/or telemedicine should be integrated into future practice to 
      improve diagnosis and treatment pathways in OM diagnosis. Longitudinal studies 
      investigating the in-vivo process of OM development, timings and in-depth 
      interactions between the triad of bacteria, viruses and the host immune response 
      are still required. Standardized methods of collection and analysis for 
      microbiome studies to enable inter-study comparisons are required. There is a 
      need to target underlying biofilms if going to effectively prevent rAOM and OME 
      and possibly enhance ventilation tube retention.

AB  - The mass production of the graphics processing unit and the coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have provided the means and the motivation, 
      respectively, for rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and medical 
      imaging techniques. This has led to new opportunities to improve patient care but 
      also new challenges that must be overcome before these techniques are put into 
      practice. In particular, early AI models reported high performances but failed to 
      perform as well on new data. However, these mistakes motivated further innovation 
      focused on developing models that were not only accurate but also stable and 
      generalizable to new data. The recent developments in AI in response to the 
      COVID-19 pandemic will reap future dividends by facilitating, expediting, and 
      informing other medical AI applications and educating the broad academic audience 
      on the topic. Furthermore, AI research on imaging animal models of infectious 
      diseases offers a unique problem space that can fill in evidence gaps that exist 
      in clinical infectious disease research. Here, we aim to provide a focused 
      assessment of the AI techniques leveraged in the infectious disease imaging 
      research space, highlight the unique challenges, and discuss burgeoning 
      solutions.

TI  - Effects of sleep-corrected social jetlag on measures of mental health, cognitive 
      ability, and brain functional connectivity in early adolescence.

AB  - Approximately half of adolescents encounter a mismatch between their sleep 
      patterns on school days and free days, also referred to as "social jetlag." This 
      condition has been linked to various adverse outcomes, such as poor sleep, 
      cognitive deficits, and mental disorders. However, prior research was 
      unsuccessful in accounting for other variables that are correlated with social 
      jetlag, including sleep duration and quality. To address this limitation, we 
      applied a propensity score matching method on a sample of 6335 11-12-year-olds 
      from the 2-year follow-up (FL2) data of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive 
      Development study. We identified 2424 pairs of participants with high 
      sleep-corrected social jetlag (SJLsc, over 1 hour) and low SJLsc (<= 1 hour) at 
      FL2 (1728 pairs have neuroimaging data), as well as 1626 pairs at 3-year 
      follow-up (FL3), after matching based on 11 covariates including socioeconomic 
      status, demographics, and sleep duration and quality. Our results showed that 
      high SJLsc, as measured by the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, was linked to 
      reduced crystallized intelligence (CI), lower school performance-grades, and 
      decreased functional connectivity between cortical networks and subcortical 
      regions, specifically between cingulo-opercular network and right hippocampus. 
      Further mediation and longitudinal mediation analyses revealed that this 
      connection mediated the associations between SJLsc and CI at FL2, and between 
      SJLsc and grades at both FL2 and FL3. We validated these findings by replicating 
      these results using objective SJLsc measurements obtained via Fitbit watches. 
      Overall, our study highlights the negative association between social jetlag and 
      CI during early adolescence.
