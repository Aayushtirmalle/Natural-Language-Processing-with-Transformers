TI  - Mechanical Intelligence (MI): A Bioinspired Concept for Transforming Engineering 
      Design.

AB  - Despite significant scientific advances in the past decades, most structures 
      around us are static and ironically outdated from a technological perspective. 
      Static structures have limited efficiency and durability and typically perform 
      only a single task. Adaptive structures, in contrast, adjust to different 
      conditions, tasks, and functions. They not only offer multi-functionality but 
      also enhanced efficiency and durability. Despite their obvious advantages over 
      conventional structures, adaptive structures have only been limitedly used in 
      everyday life applications. This is because adaptive structures often require 
      sophisticated sensing, feedback, and controls, which make them costly, heavy, and 
      complicated. To overcome this problem, here the concept of Mechanical 
      Intelligence (MI) is introduced to promote the development of engineering systems 
      that adapt to circumstances in a passive-automatic way. MI will offer a new 
      paradigm for designing structural components with superior capabilities. As 
      adaptability has been rewarded throughout evolution, nature provides one of the 
      richest sources of inspiration for developing adaptive structures. MI explores 
      nature-inspired mechanisms for automatic adaptability and translates them into a 
      new generation of mechanically intelligent components. MI structures, presenting 
      widely accessible bioinspired solutions for adaptability, will facilitate more 
      inclusive and sustainable industrial development, reflective of Goal 9 of the 
      2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

AB  - Spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to realize brain-inspired intelligence on 
      neuromorphic chips with high energy efficiency by introducing neural dynamics and 
      spike properties. As the emerging spiking deep learning paradigm attracts 
      increasing interest, traditional programming frameworks cannot meet the demands 
      of the automatic differentiation, parallel computation acceleration, and high 
      integration of processing neuromorphic datasets and deployment. In this work, we 
      present the SpikingJelly framework to address the aforementioned dilemma. We 
      contribute a full-stack toolkit for preprocessing neuromorphic datasets, building 
      deep SNNs, optimizing their parameters, and deploying SNNs on neuromorphic chips. 
      Compared to existing methods, the training of deep SNNs can be accelerated 11×, 
      and the superior extensibility and flexibility of SpikingJelly enable users to 
      accelerate custom models at low costs through multilevel inheritance and 
      semiautomatic code generation. SpikingJelly paves the way for synthesizing truly 
      energy-efficient SNN-based machine intelligence systems, which will enrich the 
      ecology of neuromorphic computing.

TI  - Assessing trait emotional intelligence and its relationship with stress and 
      health behaviour in the education sector: An empirical study from Uttarakhand, 
      India.
PG  - 320
LID - 320
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emotional intelligence of teachers can affect their mental and 
      physical health as well their performance in school. Both emotional intelligence 
      and health behavior can have an impact on stress. The majority of Indian studies 
      have examined only one type of teachers, have used indigenous scales which are 
      not internationally valid, and have not studied health behaviour. The role of age 
      and gender on emotional intelligence is also a debatable subject which requires 
      larger studies The present study was undertaken to evaluate the trait emotional 
      intelligence, stress and health behaviour of teachers and to determine their 
      inter-relationship and to assess the role of demographic and professional 
      attributes on emotional intelligence. METHODS: Teachers from different schools, 
      colleges and professional institutes situated in Dehradun and nearby towns in the 
      state of Uttarakhand, India were evaluated by internationally valid tools for the 
      three parameters. RESULTS: Emotional Intelligence of teachers has no relation 
      with age, gender, educational qualification, level of teaching or type of 
      institute. It has a negative correlation with stress and a positive correlation 
      with health behaviour. Further, health behaviour is inversely related to stress. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of emotional intelligence and health behaviour of 
      teachers should be a part of their routine evaluation and training so that 
      specific interventions to reduce stress and to improve their overall health and 
      performance can be appropriately planned.

TI  - Empathy and Emotional Intelligence in Adolescent Cyberaggressors and 
      Cybervictims.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17134681 [doi]
LID - 4681
AB  - The main objective of the present research was to examine the role played by 
      emotional intelligence in its three dimensions-emotional attention, emotional 
      clarity, and emotion regulation-and by empathy in its four 
      dimensions-perspective-taking, empathic understanding, empathic stress, and 
      empathic joy-in cyber violence, both in aggressors and victims. A total sample of 
      1318 adolescents (47% boys; aged between 11 and 17 years), enrolled in four 
      secondary compulsory education schools in Spain, participated in the study. The 
      results indicated that, regarding emotional intelligence, cyberaggressors showed 
      statistically significant differences in the dimension of emotion regulation. 
      Participation in violent online behaviors is associated with a lower capacity to 
      regulate emotions; cybervictims showed statistically significant differences in 
      the three dimensions of emotional intelligence. Regarding empathy, 
      cyberaggressors obtained statistically significant group differences in three of 
      these dimensions: perspective-taking, empathetic joy, and empathic stress. 
      Finally, the empathy dimensions for the cybervictimization groups did not show 
      significant mean differences, indicating that there was no statistical 
      relationship between the degree of cybervictimization and the individual's 
      empathy. These findings stress the relevance of emotion regulation in 
      cyberviolence in students in adolescence and allow us to understand the different 
      roles it plays for offenders and victims.

TI  - When intelligence hurts and ignorance is bliss: Global pandemic as an 
      evolutionarily novel threat to happiness.
PG  - 971-987
LID - 10.1111/jopy.12709 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The savanna theory of happiness posits that it is not only the 
      current consequences of a given situation that affect happiness but also its 
      ancestral consequences, and that the effect of ancestral consequences on 
      happiness is stronger among less intelligent individuals. But what about 
      situations that did not exist in the ancestral environment and thus have no 
      ancestral consequences? Global pandemic is one such situation that has no 
      ancestral analog, and the theory predicts such evolutionarily novel threats to 
      have a negative effect disproportionately on the life satisfaction of more 
      intelligent individuals. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively longitudinal data 
      from population samples from the National Child Development Study (Study 1) and 
      the British Cohort Study (Study 2). RESULTS: Consistent with the theoretical 
      prediction, while more intelligent individuals were generally more satisfied with 
      their lives than less intelligent individuals were throughout adulthood (albeit 
      not because they were more intelligent but because they earned more money, were 
      more likely to be married, and healthier), more intelligent individuals were less 
      satisfied with their lives during the COVID-19 global pandemic because they were 
      more intelligent. CONCLUSION: Higher intelligence may have a downside in the 
      modern world, by allowing life satisfaction to be more vulnerable from being 
      better able to comprehend the severity of problems that did not exist in the 
      ancestral world.

TI  - Intelligence quotient decline following frequent or dependent cannabis use in 
      youth: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.
PG  - 194-200
LID - 10.1017/S0033291720005036 [doi]
AB  - Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cross-sectional data assessing 
      the effect of cannabis on cognitive functioning and intelligence show 
      inconsistent results. We hypothesized that frequent and dependent cannabis use in 
      youth would be associated with Intelligence Quotient (IQ) decline. This study is 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Embase, PubMed and PsychInfo 
      from inception to 24 January 2020. We included studies with non-treatment seeking 
      samples and pre- and post-exposure measures of IQ. We requested data from authors 
      if summary data was not available from published work. We preregistered our 
      review with PROSPERO (ID no. CRD42019125624). We found seven cohort studies 
      including 808 cases and 5308 controls. We found a significant effect for the 
      association between frequent or dependent cannabis use in youth and IQ change, 
      Cohen's d = -0.132 (95% CI -0.198 to -0.066) p < 0.001. Statistical heterogeneity 
      between studies was also low at I2 = 0.2%. Study quality was moderate to high. 
      This translates to an average decline of approximately 2 IQ points following 
      exposure to cannabis in youth. Future studies should have longer periods of 
      follow up to assess the magnitude of developmental impact.

TI  - Utilizing a Digital Swarm Intelligence Platform to Improve Consensus Among 
      Radiologists and Exploring Its Applications.
PG  - 401-413
LID - 10.1007/s10278-022-00662-3 [doi]
AB  - Radiologists today play a central role in making diagnostic decisions and 
      labeling images for training and benchmarking artificial intelligence (AI) 
      algorithms. A key concern is low inter-reader reliability (IRR) seen between 
      experts when interpreting challenging cases. While team-based decisions are known 
      to outperform individual decisions, inter-personal biases often creep up in group 
      interactions which limit nondominant participants from expressing true opinions. 
      To overcome the dual problems of low consensus and interpersonal bias, we 
      explored a solution modeled on bee swarms. Two separate cohorts, three 
      board-certified radiologists, (cohort 1), and five radiology residents (cohort 2) 
      collaborated on a digital swarm platform in real time and in a blinded fashion, 
      grading meniscal lesions on knee MR exams. These consensus votes were benchmarked 
      against clinical (arthroscopy) and radiological (senior-most radiologist) 
      standards of reference using Cohen's kappa. The IRR of the consensus votes was 
      then compared to the IRR of the majority and most confident votes of the two 
      cohorts. IRR was also calculated for predictions from a meniscal lesion detecting 
      AI algorithm. The attending cohort saw an improvement of 23% in IRR of swarm 
      votes (k = 0.34) over majority vote (k = 0.11). Similar improvement of 23% in IRR 
      (k = 0.25) in 3-resident swarm votes over majority vote (k = 0.02) was observed. 
      The 5-resident swarm had an even higher improvement of 30% in IRR (k = 0.37) over 
      majority vote (k = 0.07). The swarm consensus votes outperformed individual and 
      majority vote decision in both the radiologists and resident cohorts. The 
      attending and resident swarms also outperformed predictions from a 
      state-of-the-art AI algorithm.

TI  - Testing a Cognitive Control Model of Human Intelligence.
PG  - 2898

AB  - The definition of human intelligence and its underlying psychological constructs 
      have long been debated. Although previous studies have investigated the 
      fundamental cognitive functions determining intellectual abilities, such as the 
      broadly defined executive functions including working memory, the core process 
      has yet to be identified. A potential candidate for such a role might be 
      cognitive control, a psychological construct for the coordination of thoughts and 
      actions under conditions of uncertainty. In this study, we tested a cognitive 
      control model of intellectual ability by examining the association between 
      cognitive control, measured by a perceptual decision-making task and by the 
      attention network test, and general intelligence including components of fluid 
      intelligence (Gf, concerning the ability to solve problems by abstraction) and 
      crystalized intelligence (Gc, related to learning from prior knowledge and 
      experience) measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. We also examined 
      the potential role of cognitive control as a core process involved in another 
      determinant of intellectual abilities, the working memory, measured by the N-back 
      tasks and the working memory complex span tasks. The relationship among 
      intelligence, cognitive control, and working memory was examined using structural 
      equation modeling. Results showed that cognitive control shared a large amount of 
      variance with working memory and both measures were strongly associated with Gf 
      and Gc, with a stronger association with Gf than Gc. These findings suggest that 
      cognitive control, serving as a core construct of executive functions, 
      contributes substantially to general intellectual ability, especially fluid 
      intelligence.

AB  - Psychologists have investigated creativity for 70 years, and it is now seen as 
      being an important construct, both scientifically and because of its practical 
      value to society. However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, 
      including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric 
      tests to measure divergent thinking-an important component of creativity-in a way 
      that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is 
      designed to address. We administered two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and 
      figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an 
      intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We 
      then subjected the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to 
      examine which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. Results 
      show that none of the pre-registered models fit the data well, an ambiguous 
      result that leaves unanswered the question of whether intelligence and divergent 
      thinking tests measure the same construct. Exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) 
      measurement models of each test separately shows that the TTCT-F may not measure 
      a coherent, unitary construct-leading to model misspecification when TTCT-F 
      subtests were included in larger models. This study was conducted in accordance 
      with all open science practices, including pre-registration, open data and 
      syntax, and open materials (with the exception of copyrighted and confidential 
      test stimuli). Materials are available at https://osf.io/8rpfz/.

TI  - Understanding interdisciplinary perspectives of plant intelligence: Is it a 
      matter of science, language, or subjectivity?
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/s13002-022-00539-3 [doi]
LID - 41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that plants can behave intelligently by exhibiting 
      the ability to learn, make associations between environmental cues, engage in 
      complex decisions about resource acquisition, memorize, and adapt in flexible 
      ways. However, plant intelligence is a disputed concept in the scientific 
      community. Reasons for lack of consensus can be traced back to the history of 
      Western philosophy, interpretation of terminology, and due to plants lacking 
      neurons and a central nervous system. Plant intelligence thus constitutes a novel 
      paradigm in the plant sciences. Therefore, the perspectives of scientists in 
      plant-related disciplines need to be investigated in order to gain insight into 
      the current state and future development of this concept. METHODS: This study 
      analyzed opinions of plant intelligence held by scientists from different 
      plant-related disciplines, including ethnobiology and other biological sciences, 
      through an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Our findings show that respondents' 
      personal belief systems and the frequency of taking into account other types of 
      knowledge, such as traditional knowledge, in their own field(s) of study, were 
      associated with their opinions of plant intelligence. Meanwhile, respondents' 
      professional expertise, background (discipline), or familiarity with evidence 
      provided on plant intelligence did not affect their opinions. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study emphasizes the influential role of scientists' own subjective beliefs. In 
      response, two approaches could facilitate transdisciplinary understanding among 
      scientists: (1) effective communication designed to foster change in agreement 
      based on presented information; and (2) holding space for an interdisciplinary 
      dialogue where scientists can express their own subjectivities and open new 
      opportunities for collaboration.
