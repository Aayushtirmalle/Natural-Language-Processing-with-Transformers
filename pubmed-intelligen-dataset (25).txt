AB  - Infectious diseases present a global challenge, requiring accurate diagnosis, 
      effective treatments, and preventive measures. Artificial intelligence (AI) has 
      emerged as a promising tool for analysing complex molecular data and improving 
      the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diseases. Computer-aided 
      detection (CAD) using convolutional neural networks (CNN) has gained prominence 
      for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) and other infectious diseases such as COVID-19, 
      HIV, and viral pneumonia. The review discusses the challenges and limitations 
      associated with AI in this field and explores various machine-learning models and 
      AI-based approaches. Artificial neural networks (ANN), recurrent neural networks 
      (RNN), support vector machines (SVM), multilayer neural networks (MLNN), CNN, 
      long short-term memory (LSTM), and random forests (RF) are among the models 
      discussed. The review emphasizes the potential of AI to enhance the accuracy and 
      efficiency of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diseases, 
      highlighting the need for further research and development in this area.

AB  - Precision medicine for cancer is rapidly moving to an approach that integrates 
      multiple dimensions of the biology in order to model mechanisms of cancer 
      progression in each patient. The discovery of multiple drivers per tumor 
      challenges medical decision that faces several treatment options. Drug 
      sensitivity depends on the actionability of the target, its clonal or subclonal 
      origin and coexisting genomic alterations. Sequencing has revealed a large 
      diversity of drivers emerging at treatment failure, which are potential targets 
      for clinical trials or drug repurposing. To effectively prioritize therapies, it 
      is essential to rank genomic alterations based on their proven actionability. 
      Moving beyond primary drivers, the future of precision medicine necessitates 
      acknowledging the intricate spatial and temporal heterogeneity inherent in 
      cancer. The advent of abundant complex biological data will make artificial 
      intelligence algorithms indispensable for thorough analysis. Here, we will 
      discuss the advancements brought by the use of high-throughput genomics, the 
      advantages and limitations of precision medicine studies and future perspectives 
      in this field.

AB  - The increasing use of electronic health records (EHR) based computable phenotypes 
      in clinical research is providing new opportunities for development of 
      data-driven medical applications. Adopted widely in the United States and 
      globally, EHRs facilitate systematic collection of patients' longitudinal 
      information, which serves as one of the important foundations for artificial 
      intelligence applications in medicine. Harmonization of input variables and 
      outcome definitions is critically important for wider clinical applicability of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. In this review, we focused on 
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity machine learning prediction models 
      and explored the pipeline for standardizing future disease severity model 
      development using EHR information. We identified 2,967 studies published between 
      01/01/2020 and 02/15/2022 and selected 135 independent studies that had built 
      machine learning prediction models to predict severity related outcomes of 
      COVID-19 patients based on EHR data for the final review. These 135 studies 
      spanning across 27 counties covered a broad range of severity related prediction 
      outcomes. We observed substantial inconsistency in COVID-19 severity phenotype 
      definitions among models in these studies. Moreover, there was a gap between the 
      outcome of these models and clinician-recognized clinical concepts. Accordingly, 
      we recommend that robust clinical input metrics, with outcome definitions which 
      eliminate ambiguity in interpretation, to reduce algorithmic bias, mitigate model 
      brittleness and improve generalizability of a universal model for COVID-19 
      severity. This framework can potentially be extended to broader clinical 
      application.

LID - e072069
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve 
      efficiency and quality of care in healthcare settings. The lack of consideration 
      for equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in the lifecycle of AI within 
      healthcare settings may intensify social and health inequities, potentially 
      causing harm to under-represented populations. This article describes the 
      protocol for a scoping review of the literature relating to integration of EDI in 
      the AI interventions within healthcare setting. The objective of the review is to 
      evaluate what has been done on integrating EDI concepts, principles and practices 
      in the lifecycles of AI interventions within healthcare settings. It also aims to 
      explore which EDI concepts, principles and practices have been integrated into 
      the design, development and implementation of AI in healthcare settings. METHOD 
      AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review will be guided by the six-step methodological 
      framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley supplemented by Levac et al, and 
      Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping reviews. Relevant 
      literature will be identified by searching seven electronic databases in 
      engineering/computer science and healthcare, and searching the reference lists 
      and citations of studies that meet the inclusion criteria. Studies on AI in any 
      healthcare and geographical settings, that have considered aspects of EDI, 
      published in English and French between 2005 and present will be considered. Two 
      reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles 
      according to inclusion criteria. We will conduct a thematic analysis and use a 
      narrative description to describe the work. Any disagreements will be resolved 
      through discussion with the third reviewer. Extracted data will be summarised and 
      analysed to address aims of the scoping review. Reporting will follow the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for 
      Scoping Reviews. The study began in April 2022 and is expected to end in 
      September 2023. The database initial searches resulted in 5,745 records when 
      piloted in April 2022. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not 
      required. The study will map the available literature on EDI concepts, principles 
      and practices in AI interventions within healthcare settings, highlight the 
      significance of this context, and offer insights into the best practices for 
      incorporating EDI into AI-based solutions in healthcare settings. The results 
      will be disseminated through open-access peer-reviewed publications, conference 
      presentations, social media and 2-day workshops with relevant stakeholders.

TI  - Evaluating a large language model's ability to solve programming exercises from 
      an introductory bioinformatics course.

AB  - Computer programming is a fundamental tool for life scientists, allowing them to 
      carry out essential research tasks. However, despite various educational efforts, 
      learning to write code can be a challenging endeavor for students and researchers 
      in life-sciences disciplines. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have 
      made it possible to translate human-language prompts to functional code, raising 
      questions about whether these technologies can aid (or replace) life scientists' 
      efforts to write code. Using 184 programming exercises from an 
      introductory-bioinformatics course, we evaluated the extent to which one such 
      tool-OpenAI's ChatGPT-could successfully complete programming tasks. ChatGPT 
      solved 139 (75.5%) of the exercises on its first attempt. For the remaining 
      exercises, we provided natural-language feedback to the model, prompting it to 
      try different approaches. Within 7 or fewer attempts, ChatGPT solved 179 (97.3%) 
      of the exercises. These findings have implications for life-sciences education 
      and research. Instructors may need to adapt their pedagogical approaches and 
      assessment techniques to account for these new capabilities that are available to 
      the general public. For some programming tasks, researchers may be able to work 
      in collaboration with machine-learning models to produce functional code.

AB  - Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data has always been one of the main 
      concerns in the field of information security. Accordingly, various solutions 
      have been proposed to meet this requirement, among which encryption can be 
      considered as one of the first and most effective solutions. The continuous 
      increase in the computational power of computers and the rapid development of 
      artificial intelligence techniques have made many previous encryption solutions 
      not secure enough to protect data. Therefore, there is always a need to provide 
      new and more efficient strategies for encrypting information. In this article, a 
      two-way approach for information encryption based on chaos theory is presented. 
      To this end, a new chaos model is first proposed. This model, in addition to 
      having a larger key space and high sensitivity to slight key changes, can 
      demonstrate a higher level of chaotic behavior compared to previous models. In 
      the proposed method, first, the input is converted to a vector of bytes and first 
      diffusion is applied on it. Then, the permutation order of chaotic sequence is 
      used for diffusing bytes of data. In the next step, the chaotic sequence is used 
      for applying second diffusion on confused data. Finally, to further reduce the 
      data correlation, an iterative reversible rule-based model is used to apply final 
      diffusion on data. The performance of the proposed method in encrypting image, 
      text, and audio data was evaluated. The analysis of the test results showed that 
      the proposed encryption strategy can demonstrate a pattern close to a random 
      state by reducing data correlation at least 28.57% compared to previous works. 
      Also, the data encrypted by proposed method, show at least 14.15% and 1.79% 
      increment in terms of MSE and BER, respectively. In addition, key sensitivity of 
      10-28 and average entropy of 7.9993 in the proposed model, indicate its high 
      resistance to brute-force, statistical, plaintext and differential attacks.

AB  - Several studies have shown the relevance among students of the quality of their 
      interpersonal relationships for their academic achievement. Nevertheless, most 
      studies available have explored the relation between the cognitive functioning 
      and academic achievement without taking into account the quality of the 
      relationships experienced in the school environment. Furthermore, the studies 
      that have begun to consider the joint role of these factors in the prediction of 
      academic achievement are scant. Therefore, it appears of relevance to deepen the 
      relation between cognitive functioning and quality of school relationships in 
      order to support students' academic achievement and the potential of youth. In 
      this paper, we examined the moderating role of the quality of student-teacher 
      relationships and school bonding (STR-SB) in the associations of fluid 
      intelligence (Gf) with academic achievement among adolescents (N = 219). A 
      multiple-group structural equation modelling analysis revealed that STR-SB 
      quality moderated unexpectedly only the link between Gf and mathematics. The 
      findings support the idea that the quality of student-teacher relationships may 
      be a relevant dimension to be considered to clarify the association between 
      cognitive functioning and academic achievement.

TI  - Personalized laboratory medicine in the digital health era: recent developments 
      and future challenges.
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2023-0808 [doi]
AB  - Interpretation of laboratory data is a comparative procedure and requires 
      reliable reference data, which are mostly derived from population data but used 
      for individuals in conventional laboratory medicine. Using population data as a 
      "reference" for individuals has generated several problems related to diagnosing, 
      monitoring, and treating single individuals. This issue can be resolved by using 
      data from individuals' repeated samples, as their personal reference, thus 
      needing that laboratory data be personalized. The modern laboratory information 
      system (LIS) can store the results of repeated measurements from millions of 
      individuals. These data can then be analyzed to generate a variety of 
      personalized reference data sets for numerous comparisons. In this manuscript, we 
      redefine the term "personalized laboratory medicine" as the practices based on 
      individual-specific samples and data. These reflect their unique biological 
      characteristics, encompassing omics data, clinical chemistry, endocrinology, 
      hematology, coagulation, and within-person biological variation of all laboratory 
      data. It also includes information about individuals' health behavior, 
      chronotypes, and all statistical algorithms used to make precise decisions. This 
      approach facilitates more accurate diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of 
      diseases for each individual. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements and 
      future challenges of personalized laboratory medicine in the context of the 
      digital health era.

TI  - Artificial neural networks for performance prediction of full-scale wastewater 
      treatment plants: a systematic review.
PG  - 1447-1470
LID - 10.2166/wst.2023.276 [doi]
AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are complex systems that must maintain high 
      levels of performance to achieve adequate effluent quality to protect the 
      environment and public health. Artificial intelligence and machine learning 
      methods have gained attention in recent years for modeling complex problems, such 
      as wastewater treatment. Although artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been 
      identified as the most common of these methods, no study has investigated the 
      development and configuration of these models. We conducted a systematic 
      literature review on the use of ANNs to predict the effluent quality and removal 
      efficiencies of full-scale WWTPs. Three databases were searched, and 44 records 
      of the 667 identified were selected based on the eligibility criteria. The data 
      extracted from the papers showed that the majority of studies used the 
      feedforward neural network model with a backpropagation training algorithm to 
      predict the effluent quality of plants, particularly in terms of organic matter 
      indicators. The findings of this research may help in the search for an optimum 
      design modeling process for future studies of similar prediction problems.

TI  - Performance of ChatGPT on the Peruvian National Licensing Medical Examination: 
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e48039
LID - 10.2196/48039 [doi]
LID - e48039
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT has shown impressive performance in national medical 
      licensing examinations, such as the United States Medical Licensing Examination 
      (USMLE), even passing it with expert-level performance. However, there is a lack 
      of research on its performance in low-income countries' national licensing 
      medical examinations. In Peru, where almost one out of three examinees fails the 
      national licensing medical examination, ChatGPT has the potential to enhance 
      medical education. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT using 
      GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the Peruvian National Licensing Medical Examination (Examen 
      Nacional de Medicina [ENAM]). Additionally, we sought to identify factors 
      associated with incorrect answers provided by ChatGPT. METHODS: We used the ENAM 
      2022 data set, which consisted of 180 multiple-choice questions, to evaluate the 
      performance of ChatGPT. Various prompts were used, and accuracy was evaluated. 
      The performance of ChatGPT was compared to that of a sample of 1025 examinees. 
      Factors such as question type, Peruvian-specific knowledge, discrimination, 
      difficulty, quality of questions, and subject were analyzed to determine their 
      influence on incorrect answers. Questions that received incorrect answers 
      underwent a three-step process involving different prompts to explore the 
      potential impact of adding roles and context on ChatGPT's accuracy. RESULTS: 
      GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of 86% on the ENAM, followed by GPT-3.5 with 77%. The 
      accuracy obtained by the 1025 examinees was 55%. There was a fair agreement 
      (κ=0.38) between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moderate-to-high-difficulty questions were 
      associated with incorrect answers in the crude and adjusted model for GPT-3.5 
      (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.73-15.95) and GPT-4 (OR 33.23, 95% CI 4.3-257.12). 
      After reinputting questions that received incorrect answers, GPT-3.5 went from 41 
      (100%) to 12 (29%) incorrect answers, and GPT-4 from 25 (100%) to 4 (16%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can achieve 
      expert-level performance on the ENAM, outperforming most of our examinees. We 
      found fair agreement between both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Incorrect answers were 
      associated with the difficulty of questions, which may resemble human 
      performance. Furthermore, by reinputting questions that initially received 
      incorrect answers with different prompts containing additional roles and context, 
      ChatGPT achieved improved accuracy.
