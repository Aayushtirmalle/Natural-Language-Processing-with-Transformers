AB  - We assessed the accuracy of advice provided by ChatGPT for pre-travel 
      counselling. ChatGPT appears to be complementary to the physical pre-travel 
      consultation, giving appropriate advice and raising awareness. However, the 
      advice lacked specificity, and travel physicians can help to fine-tune the advice 
      provided to an individual's specific travel needs.

TI  - Assessing Serious Spinal Pathology Using Bayesian Network Decision Support: 
      Development and Validation Study.
PG  - e44187
LID - 10.2196/44187 [doi]
LID - e44187
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying and managing serious spinal pathology (SSP) such as cauda 
      equina syndrome or spinal infection in patients presenting with low back pain is 
      challenging. Traditional red flag questioning is increasingly criticized, and 
      previous studies show that many clinicians lack confidence in managing patients 
      presenting with red flags. Improving decision-making and reducing the variability 
      of care for these patients is a key priority for clinicians and researchers. 
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to improve SSP identification by constructing and validating 
      a decision support tool using a Bayesian network (BN), which is an artificial 
      intelligence technique that combines current evidence and expert knowledge. 
      METHODS: A modified RAND appropriateness procedure was undertaken with 16 experts 
      over 3 rounds, designed to elicit the variables, structure, and conditional 
      probabilities necessary to build a causal BN. The BN predicts the likelihood of a 
      patient with a particular presentation having an SSP. The second part of this 
      study used an established framework to direct a 4-part validation that included 
      comparison of the BN with consensus statements, practice guidelines, and recent 
      research. Clinical cases were entered into the model and the results were 
      compared with clinical judgment from spinal experts who were not involved in the 
      elicitation. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted and area under 
      the curve were calculated for accuracy statistics. RESULTS: The RAND 
      appropriateness procedure elicited a model including 38 variables in 3 domains: 
      risk factors (10 variables), signs and symptoms (17 variables), and judgment 
      factors (11 variables). Clear consensus was found in the risk factors and signs 
      and symptoms for SSP conditions. The 4-part BN validation demonstrated good 
      performance overall and identified areas for further development. Comparison with 
      available clinical literature showed good overall agreement but suggested certain 
      improvements required to, for example, 2 of the 11 judgment factors. Case 
      analysis showed that cauda equina syndrome, space-occupying lesion/cancer, and 
      inflammatory condition identification performed well across the validation 
      domains. Fracture identification performed less well, but the reasons for the 
      erroneous results are well understood. A review of the content by independent 
      spinal experts backed up the issues with the fracture node, but the BN was 
      otherwise deemed acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The RAND appropriateness procedure and 
      validation framework were successfully implemented to develop the BN for SSP. In 
      comparison with other expert-elicited BN studies, this work goes a step further 
      in validating the output before attempting implementation. Using a framework for 
      model validation, the BN showed encouraging validity and has provided avenues for 
      further developing the outputs that demonstrated poor accuracy. This study 
      provides the vital first step of improving our ability to predict outcomes in low 
      back pain by first considering the problem of SSP. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED

TI  - Conversational AI and Vaccine Communication: Systematic Review of the Evidence.
PG  - e42758
LID - 10.2196/42758 [doi]
LID - e42758
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the mid-2010s, use of conversational artificial intelligence 
      (AI; chatbots) in health care has expanded significantly, especially in the 
      context of increased burdens on health systems and restrictions on in-person 
      consultations with health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. One 
      emerging use for conversational AI is to capture evolving questions and 
      communicate information about vaccines and vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The objective 
      of this systematic review was to examine documented uses and evidence on the 
      effectiveness of conversational AI for vaccine communication. METHODS: This 
      systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, 
      PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Embase, 
      Epistemonikos, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, Academic Search Complete, and 
      the University of London library database were searched for papers on the use of 
      conversational AI for vaccine communication. The inclusion criteria were studies 
      that included (1) documented instances of conversational AI being used for the 
      purpose of vaccine communication and (2) evaluation data on the impact and 
      effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: After duplicates were removed, the 
      review identified 496 unique records, which were then screened by title and 
      abstract, of which 38 were identified for full-text review. Seven fit the 
      inclusion criteria and were assessed and summarized in the findings of this 
      review. Overall, vaccine chatbots deployed to date have been relatively simple in 
      their design and have mainly been used to provide factual information to users in 
      response to their questions about vaccines. Additionally, chatbots have been used 
      for vaccination scheduling, appointment reminders, debunking misinformation, and, 
      in some cases, for vaccine counseling and persuasion. Available evidence suggests 
      that chatbots can have a positive effect on vaccine attitudes; however, studies 
      were typically exploratory in nature, and some lacked a control group or had very 
      small sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The review found evidence of potential benefits 
      from conversational AI for vaccine communication. Factors that may contribute to 
      the effectiveness of vaccine chatbots include their ability to provide credible 
      and personalized information in real time, the familiarity and accessibility of 
      the chatbot platform, and the extent to which interactions with the chatbot feel 
      "natural" to users. However, evaluations have focused on the short-term, direct 
      effects of chatbots on their users. The potential longer-term and societal 
      impacts of conversational AI have yet to be analyzed. In addition, existing 
      studies do not adequately address how ethics apply in the field of conversational 
      AI around vaccines. In a context where further digitalization of vaccine 
      communication can be anticipated, additional high-quality research will be 
      required across all these areas.

AB  - Effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can improve the survival of patients 
      with locally progressive gastric cancer, but chemotherapeutics do not always 
      exhibit good efficacy in all patients. Therefore, accurate preoperative 
      evaluation of the effect of neoadjuvant therapy and the appropriate selection of 
      surgery time to minimize toxicity and complications while prolonging patient 
      survival are key issues that need to be addressed. This paper reviews the role of 
      three imaging methods, morphological, functional, radiomics, and artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based imaging, in evaluating NAC pathological reactions for 
      gastric cancer. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of each method and 
      the future application prospects are discussed.

TI  - AI-based hip prosthesis failure prediction through evolutional radiological 
      indices.
LID - 10.1007/s00402-023-05069-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop artificial intelligence models for 
      predicting hip implant failure from radiological features. Analyzing the 
      evolution of the periprosthetic bone and implant's position throughout the entire 
      follow-up period has shown the potential to be more relevant in outcome 
      prediction than simply considering the latest radiographic images. Thus, we 
      investigated an AI-based model employing a small set of evolutional parameters 
      derived from conventional radiological features to predict hip prosthesis 
      failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine radiological features were 
      annotated from historical anteroposterior and lateral radiographs for 162 total 
      hip arthroplasty patients, 32 of which later underwent implant failure. Linear 
      regression on each patient's chronologically sorted radiological features was 
      employed to derive 169 corresponding evolutional parameters per image. Three sets 
      of machine learning predictors were developed: one employing the original 
      features (standard model), one the evolutional ones (evolutional model), and the 
      last their union (hybrid model). Each set included a model employing all the 
      available features (full model) and a model employing the few most predictive 
      ones according to Gini importance (minimal model). RESULTS: The evolutional and 
      hybrid predictors resulted highly effective (area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 
      full models = 0.94), outperforming the standard one, whose AUC was only 0.82. The 
      minimal hybrid model, employing just four features, three of which evolutional, 
      scored an AUC of 0.95, proving even more accurate than the full one, exploiting 
      173 features. This tool could be shaped to be either highly specific 
      (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 98.6%) or highly sensitive (sensitivity: 90%, 
      specificity: 92.4%). CONCLUSION: The proposed predictor may represent a highly 
      sensitive screening tool for clinicians, capable to predict THA failure with an 
      advance between a few months and more than a year through only four radiological 
      parameters, considering either their value at the latest visit or their evolution 
      through time.

TI  - Prospective Evaluation of AI Triage of Pulmonary Emboli on CT Pulmonary 
      Angiograms.

LID - 10.1148/radiol.230702 [doi]
AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown high accuracy for 
      detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) studies 
      in academic studies. Purpose To determine whether use of an AI triage system to 
      detect PE on CTPA studies improves radiologist performance or examination and 
      report turnaround times in a clinical setting. Materials and Methods This 
      prospective single-center study included adult participants who underwent CTPA 
      for suspected PE in a clinical practice setting. Consecutive CTPA studies were 
      evaluated in two phases, first by radiologists alone (n = 31) (May 2021 to June 
      2021) and then by radiologists aided by a commercially available AI triage system 
      (n = 37) (September 2021 to December 2021). Sixty-two percent of radiologists (26 
      of 42 radiologists) interpreted studies in both phases. The reference standard 
      was determined by an independent re-review of studies by thoracic radiologists 
      and was used to calculate performance metrics. Diagnostic accuracy and turnaround 
      times were compared using Pearson χ(2) and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results 
      Phases 1 and 2 included 503 studies (participant mean age, 54.0 years ± 17.8 
      [SD]; 275 female, 228 male) and 1023 studies (participant mean age, 55.1 years ± 
      17.5; 583 female, 440 male), respectively. In phases 1 and 2, 14.5% (73 of 503) 
      and 15.9% (163 of 1023) of CTPA studies were positive for PE (P = .47). Mean wait 
      time for positive PE studies decreased from 21.5 minutes without AI to 11.3 
      minutes with AI (P < .001). The accuracy and miss rate, respectively, for 
      radiologist detection of any PE on CTPA studies was 97.6% and 12.3% without AI 
      and 98.6% and 6.1% with AI, which was not significantly different (P = .15 and P 
      = .11, respectively). Conclusion The use of an AI triage system to detect any PE 
      on CTPA studies improved wait times but did not improve radiologist accuracy, 
      miss rate, or examination and report turnaround times. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental

PG  - e14166
LID - 10.1002/acm2.14166 [doi]

AB  - PURPOSE: To validate a novel deep learning-based metal artifact correction (MAC) 
      algorithm for CT, namely, AI-MAC, in preclinical setting with comparison to 
      conventional MAC and virtual monochromatic imaging (VMI) technique. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: An experimental phantom was designed by consecutively inserting two sets 
      of pedicle screws (size Φ 6.5 × 30-mm and Φ 7.5 × 40-mm) into a vertebral 
      specimen to simulate the clinical scenario of metal implantation. The resulting 
      MAC, VMI, and AI-MAC images were compared with respect to the metal-free 
      reference image by subjective scoring, as well as by CT attenuation, image noise, 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and correction 
      accuracy via adaptive segmentation of the paraspinal muscle and vertebral body. 
      RESULTS: The AI-MAC and VMI images showed significantly higher subjective scores 
      than the MAC image (all p < 0.05). The SNRs and CNRs on the AI-MAC image were 
      comparable to the reference (all p > 0.05), whereas those on the VMI were 
      significantly lower (all p < 0.05). The paraspinal muscle segmented on the AI-MAC 
      image was 4.6% and 5.1% more complete to the VMI and MAC images for the Φ 
      6.5 × 30-mm screws, and 5.0% and 5.1% for the Φ 7.5 × 40-mm screws, respectively. 
      The vertebral body segmented on the VMI was closest to the reference, with only 
      3.2% and 7.4% overestimation for Φ 6.5 × 30-mm and Φ 7.5 × 40-mm screws, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using metal-free reference as the ground truth for 
      comparison, the AI-MAC outperforms VMI in characterizing soft tissue, while VMI 
      is useful in skeletal depiction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicidal Behaviors and Thoughts are a relevant public health issue 
      that includes suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-harm, attempted suicide, and 
      failed suicides. Since there is a progression of suicidal behaviors, whereby 
      suicide is more likely to be completed if there have already been previous 
      behaviors or attempts to harm oneself, WHO has highlighted the need to detect 
      early predictors of such suicidal behaviors, which can help identify individuals 
      at risk, plan prevention strategies and implement specific therapeutic 
      interventions, particularly in young people, thus reducing the number of deaths. 
      This retrospective observational study aimed to identify early predictors of 
      suicidal risk in 237 inpatients admitted for Suicidal Behaviors and Thoughts at 
      Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Emergency Unit of the Meyer Children's Hospital, 
      Florence, Italy. METHODS: The study was subdivided into three phases: data 
      collection, statistical analysis, and neural network. For each patient, we 
      collected epidemiological and psychopathological data. We stratified the 
      inpatients into two groups: "suicidal volition patients" and "suicidal motivation 
      patients." RESULTS: The hospitalization rate for suicidal behaviors and thoughts 
      showed a growing trend from 2016 to 2020 (27.69 to 45.28%). Under 12 years of 
      age, diagnosis of disruptive, impulse-control and conduct disorder, previous 
      specialist care, history of attempted suicide, and intoxication as methods of 
      suicide were statistically correlated to an increased risk of suicidal behaviors. 
      Artificial intelligence, with an accuracy of 86.7%, confirmed these risk factors. 
      LIMITATIONS: The most important limitation of the study is its retrospective 
      nature. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies new early predictors of suicidal risk: 
      age less than 12, diagnosis of disruptive, impulse-control and conduct disorder. 
      In addition, suicidal volition behavior emerges as an important and 
      underestimated risk factor. The use of artificial intelligence methods could be 
      supporting the clinician in assessing suicidal risk.
