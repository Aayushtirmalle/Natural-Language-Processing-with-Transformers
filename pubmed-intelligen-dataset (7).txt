AB  - Since the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, endoscopy 
      applications in gastroenterology have been at the forefront of innovations. The 
      ever-increasing number of studies necessitates the need to organize and classify 
      applications in a useful way. Separating AI capabilities by computer aided 
      detection (CADe), diagnosis (CADx), and quality assessment (CADq) allows for a 
      systematic evaluation of each application. CADe studies have shown promise in 
      accurate detection of esophageal, gastric and colonic neoplasia as well as 
      identifying sources of bleeding and Crohn's disease in the small bowel. While 
      more advanced CADx applications employ optical biopsies to give further 
      information to characterize neoplasia and grade inflammatory disease, diverse 
      CADq applications ensure quality and increase the efficiency of procedures. 
      Future applications show promise in advanced therapeutic modalities and 
      integrated systems that provide multimodal capabilities. AI is set to 
      revolutionize clinical decision making and performance of endoscopy.

TI  - Random tree algorithm to analyse the relation between type of traumatic dental 
      injuries and its demographic and predisposing factors - A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 114-118
LID - 10.4103/ijdr.ijdr_846_21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) have become the public 
      dental health problem worldwide in children and adolescents. These injuries are 
      complex and multifactorial in aetiology. This study was done with the aim to 
      analyse the association of 'type of TDI' with its demographic and various 
      predisposing factors in children by an advanced statistical method of machine 
      learning (ML) of artificial intelligence (AI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present 
      study's data were gathered by conducting the observational cross-sectional study 
      among index age-groups 12 and 15 years children of randomly selected schools of 
      different geographical regions. Structured interviews and dental examinations 
      performed were done to record the variables of TDIs in self-constructed proforma. 
      The gathered data were analysed by employing the random-tree model of machine 
      learning algorithm of IBM SPSS Modeler version-18 software. RESULTS: 
      Molar-relationship (2.5), age (1.75), sex (1.5) and geographical region/area 
      (~1.5) were the most important predictors (factors) for the determination of type 
      of dental injury as shown by the random tree model, whereas clinical factors like 
      overjet (0.75), lip-competence (0.5) and overbite (0.5) showed lesser importance 
      in the determination of type of TDIs. CONCLUSION: Demographic factors (age, sex 
      and geographical region) and one clinical factor (molar-relation) were found as 
      the stronger factors for determining the type of traumatic dental injury in 
      children.

TI  - Precision oncology: Artificial intelligence, circulating cell-free DNA, and the 
      minimally invasive detection of pancreatic cancer-A pilot study.
PG  - 19644-19655
LID - 10.1002/cam4.6604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the most lethal cancers. The lack of 
      effective tools for early detection results in late tumor detection and, 
      consequently, high mortality rate. Precision oncology aims to develop targeted 
      individual treatments based on advanced computational approaches of omics data. 
      Biomarkers, such as global alteration of cytosine (CpG) methylation, can be 
      pivotal for these objectives. In this study, we performed DNA methylation 
      profiling of pancreatic cancer patients using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
      and artificial intelligence (AI) including Deep Learning (DL) for minimally 
      invasive detection to elucidate the epigenetic pathogenesis of PC. METHODS: The 
      Illumina Infinium HD Assay was used for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 
      cfDNA in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients. Six AI algorithms were used to determine PC 
      detection accuracy based on cytosine (CpG) methylation markers. Additional 
      strategies for minimizing overfitting were employed. The molecular pathogenesis 
      was interrogated using enrichment analysis. RESULTS: In total, we identified 4556 
      significantly differentially methylated CpGs (q-valueâ<â0.05; Bonferroni 
      correction) in PC versus controls. Highly accurate PC detection was achieved with 
      all 6 AI platforms (Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve 
      [0.90-1.00]). For example, DL achieved AUC (95% CI): 1.00 (0.95-1.00), with a 
      sensitivity and specificity of 100%. A separate modeling approach based on 
      logistic regression-based yielded an AUC (95% CI) 1.0 (1.0-1.0) with a 
      sensitivity and specificity of 100% for PC detection. The top four biological 
      pathways that were epigenetically altered in PC and are known to be linked with 
      cancer are discussed. CONCLUSION: Using a minimally invasive approach, AI, and 
      epigenetic analysis of circulating cfDNA, high predictive accuracy for PC was 
      achieved. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that that early 
      detection leading to improved overall survival may be achievable in the future.

PG  - 5456-5474
LID - 10.1111/febs.16968 [doi]
AB  - More than 20âyears ago, signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and its homologues, the 
      signal peptide peptidase-like (SPPL) proteases have been identified based on 
      their sequence similarity to presenilins, a related family of intramembrane 
      aspartyl proteases. Other than those for the presenilins, no high-resolution 
      structures for the SPP/SPPL proteases are available. Despite this limitation, 
      over the years bioinformatical and biochemical data have accumulated, which 
      altogether have provided a picture of the overall structure and topology of these 
      proteases, their localization in the cell, the process of substrate recognition, 
      their cleavage mechanism, and their function. Recently, the artificial 
      intelligence-based structure prediction tool AlphaFold has added high-confidence 
      models of the expected fold of SPP/SPPL proteases. In this review, we summarize 
      known structural aspects of the SPP/SPPL family as well as their substrates. Of 
      particular interest are the emerging substrate recognition and catalytic 
      mechanisms that might lead to the prediction and identification of more potential 
      substrates and deeper insight into physiological and pathophysiological roles of 
      proteolysis.

TI  - Performance of a deep learning enhancement method applied to PET images acquired 
      with a reduced acquisition time.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.5603/nmr.94482 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the performance of a deep learning 
      enhancement method in PET images reconstructed with a shorter acquisition time, 
      and different reconstruction algorithms. The impact of the enhancement on 
      clinical decisions was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven subjects 
      underwent clinical whole-body [18F]FDG PET/CT exams with an acquisition time of 
      1.5 min per bed position. PET images were reconstructed with the OSEM algorithm 
      using 66% counts (imitating 1 min/bed acquisition time) and 100% counts (1.5 
      min/bed). Images reconstructed from 66% counts were subsequently enhanced using 
      the SubtlePETâ¢ (SP) deep-learning-based software, (Subtle Medical, USA) - with 
      two different software versions (SP1 and SP2). Additionally, images obtained with 
      66% counts were reconstructed with QClearâ¢ (GE, USA) algorithm and enhanced with 
      SP2. Volumes of interest (VOI) of the lesions and reference VOIs in the liver, 
      brain, bladder, and mediastinum were drawn on OSEM images and copied on SP 
      images. Quantitative SUVmax values per VOI of OSEM or QClearâ¢ and AI-enhanced 
      'shortened' acquisitions were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two VOIs 
      were identified (37 for each reference region, and 104 for the lesions) for OSEM, 
      SP1, SP2, and QClearâ¢ images AI-enhanced with SP2. SUVmax values on SP1 images 
      were lower than standard OSEM, but on SP2 differences were smaller (average 
      difference for SP1 11.6%, for SP2 -4.5%). For images reconstructed with QClearâ¢, 
      SUVmax values were higher (average +8.9%, median 6.1%, SD 18.9%). For small 
      lesions with SUVmax values range 2.0 to 4.0 decrease of measured SUVmax was much 
      less significant with SP2 (for liver average -6.5%, median -5.6% for lesions 
      average -5.6%, median - 6.0, SD 5.2%) and showed the best correlation with 
      original OSEM. While no artifacts and good general diagnostic confidence were 
      found in AI-enhanced images, SP1, the images were not equal to the original OSEM 
      - some lesions were hard to spot. SP2 produced images with almost the same 
      quality as the original 1.5 min/bed OSEM reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The studied 
      deep learning enhancement method can be used to accelerate PET acquisitions 
      without compromising quantitative SUVmax values. AI-based algorithms can enhance 
      the image quality of accelerated PET acquisitions, enabling the dose reduction to 
      the patients and improving the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT imaging.

TI  - A comparative evaluation of three consecutive artificial intelligence algorithms 
      released by Techcyte for identification of blasts and white blood cells in 
      abnormal peripheral blood films.
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.14180 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital pathology artificial intelligence (AI) platforms have the 
      capacity to improve over time through "deep machine learning." We have previously 
      reported on the accuracy of peripheral white blood cell (WBC) differential and 
      blast identification by Techcyte (Techcyte, Inc., Orem, UT, USA), a digital 
      scanner-agnostic web-based system for blood film reporting. The aim of the 
      current study was to compare AI protocols released over time to assess 
      improvement in cell identification. METHODS: WBC differentials were performed 
      using Techcyte's online AI software on the same 124 digitized abnormal peripheral 
      blood films (including 64 acute and 22 chronic leukaemias) in 2019 (AI1), 2020 
      (AI2), and 2022 (AI3), with no reassignment by a morphologist at any time point. 
      AI results were correlated to the "gold standard" of manual microscopy, and 
      comparison of Lin's concordance coefficients (LCC) and sensitivity and 
      specificity of blast identification were used to determine the superior AI 
      version. RESULTS: AI correlations (r) with manual microscopy for individual cell 
      types ranged from 0.50-0.90 (AI1), 0.66-0.86 (AI2) and 0.71-0.91 (AI3). AI3 
      concordance with manual microscopy was significantly improved compared to AI1 for 
      identification of neutrophils (LCC AI3â=â0.86 vs. AI1â=â0.77, pâ=â0.03), total 
      granulocytes (LCC AI3â=â0.92 vs. AI1â=â0.82, pâ=â0.0008), immature granulocytes 
      (LCC AI3â=â0.67 vs. AI1â=â0.38, pâ=â0.0014), and promyelocytes (LCC AI3â=â0.53 
      vs. AI1â=â0.16, pâ=â0.0008). Sensitivity for blast identification (nâ=â65 slides) 
      improved from 97% (AI1), to 98% (AI2), to 100% (AI3), while blast specificity 
      decreased from 24% (AI1), to 14% (AI2) to 12% (AI3). CONCLUSION: Techcyte AI has 
      shown significant improvement in cell identification over time and maintains high 
      sensitivity for blast identification in malignant films.

PG  - 285-287
LID - 10.1109/cai54212.2023.00127 [doi]
AB  - Current genomics interventions have limitations in accounting for cell stimuli 
      and the dynamic response to intervention. Although genomic sequencing and 
      analysis have led to significant advances in personalized medicine, the 
      complexity of cellular interactions and the dynamic nature of the cellular 
      response to stimuli pose significant challenges. These limitations can lead to 
      chronic disease recurrence and inefficient genomic interventions. Therefore, it 
      is necessary to capture the full range of cellular responses to develop effective 
      interventions. This paper presents a game-theoretic model of the fight between 
      the cell and intervention, demonstrating analytically and numerically why current 
      interventions become ineffective over time. The performance is analyzed using 
      melanoma regulatory networks, and the role of artificial intelligence in deriving 
      effective solutions is described.

TI  - Enhancing Luciferase Activity and Stability through Generative Modeling of 
      Natural Enzyme Sequences.
LID - 2023.09.18.558367 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.09.18.558367 [doi]
AB  - The availability of natural protein sequences synergized with generative 
      artificial intelligence (AI) provides new paradigms to create enzymes. Although 
      active enzyme variants with numerous mutations have been produced using 
      generative models, their performance often falls short compared to their 
      wild-type counterparts. Additionally, in practical applications, choosing fewer 
      mutations that can rival the efficacy of extensive sequence alterations is 
      usually more advantageous. Pinpointing beneficial single mutations continues to 
      be a formidable task. In this study, using the generative maximum entropy model 
      to analyze Renilla luciferase homologs, and in conjunction with biochemistry 
      experiments, we demonstrated that natural evolutionary information could be used 
      to predictively improve enzyme activity and stability by engineering the active 
      center and protein scaffold, respectively. The success rate of designed single 
      mutants is ~50% to improve either luciferase activity or stability. These finding 
      highlights nature's ingenious approach to evolving proficient enzymes, wherein 
      diverse evolutionary pressures are preferentially applied to distinct regions of 
      the enzyme, ultimately culminating in an overall high performance. We also reveal 
      an evolutionary preference in Renilla luciferase towards emitting blue light that 
      holds advantages in terms of water penetration compared to other light spectrum. 
      Taken together, our approach facilitates navigation through enzyme sequence space 
      and offers effective strategies for computer-aided rational enzyme engineering.
