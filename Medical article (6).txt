AB  - Navigating social systems efficiently is critical to our species. Humans appear 
      endowed with a cognitive system that has formed to meet the unique challenges 
      that emerge for highly social species. Bullshitting, communication characterised 
      by an intent to be convincing or impressive without concern for truth, is 
      ubiquitous within human societies. Across two studies (N = 1,017), we assess 
      participants' ability to produce satisfying and seemingly accurate bullshit as an 
      honest signal of their intelligence. We find that bullshit ability is associated 
      with an individual's intelligence and individuals capable of producing more 
      satisfying bullshit are judged by second-hand observers to be more intelligent. 
      We interpret these results as adding evidence for intelligence being geared 
      towards the navigation of social systems. The ability to produce satisfying 
      bullshit may serve to assist individuals in negotiating their social world, both 
      as an energetically efficient strategy for impressing others and as an honest 
      signal of intelligence.

TI  - Load Balancing Using Artificial Intelligence for Cloud-Enabled Internet of 
      Everything in Healthcare Domain.
LID - 10.3390/s23115349 [doi]
LID - 5349
AB  - The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its subsequent evolution into 
      the Internet of Everything (IoE) is a result of the rapid growth of information 
      and communication technologies (ICT). However, implementing these technologies 
      comes with certain obstacles, such as the limited availability of energy 
      resources and processing power. Consequently, there is a need for 
      energy-efficient and intelligent load-balancing models, particularly in 
      healthcare, where real-time applications generate large volumes of data. This 
      paper proposes a novel, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI)-based load 
      balancing model that employs the Chaotic Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm 
      (CHROA) and big data analytics (BDA) for cloud-enabled IoT environments. The 
      CHROA technique enhances the optimization capacity of the Horse Ride Optimization 
      Algorithm (HROA) using chaotic principles. The proposed CHROA model balances the 
      load, optimizes available energy resources using AI techniques, and is evaluated 
      using various metrics. Experimental results show that the CHROA model outperforms 
      existing models. For instance, while the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), 
      Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Whale Defense Algorithm with Firefly 
      Algorithm (WD-FA) techniques attain average throughputs of 58.247 Kbps, 59.957 
      Kbps, and 60.819 Kbps, respectively, the CHROA model achieves an average 
      throughput of 70.122 Kbps. The proposed CHROA-based model presents an innovative 
      approach to intelligent load balancing and energy optimization in cloud-enabled 
      IoT environments. The results highlight its potential to address critical 
      challenges and contribute to developing efficient and sustainable IoT/IoE 
      solutions.

      Understanding.

AB  - Computer audition (i.e., intelligent audio) has made great strides in recent 
      years; however, it is still far from achieving holistic hearing abilities, which 
      more appropriately mimic human-like understanding. Within an audio scene, a human 
      listener is quickly able to interpret layers of sound at a single time-point, 
      with each layer varying in characteristics such as location, state, and trait. 
      Currently, integrated machine listening approaches, on the other hand, will 
      mainly recognise only single events. In this context, this contribution aims to 
      provide key insights and approaches, which can be applied in computer audition to 
      achieve the goal of a more holistic intelligent understanding system, as well as 
      identifying challenges in reaching this goal. We firstly summarise the 
      state-of-the-art in traditional signal-processing-based audio pre-processing and 
      feature representation, as well as automated learning such as by deep neural 
      networks. This concerns, in particular, audio interpretation, decomposition, 
      understanding, as well as ontologisation. We then present an agent-based approach 
      for integrating these concepts as a holistic audio understanding system. Based on 
      this, concluding, avenues are given towards reaching the ambitious goal of 
      'holistic human-parity' machine listening abilities.

AB  - Although the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is still in its 
      early stages, it is important to understand the factors influencing its adoption. 
      Using a qualitative multi-case study of three hospitals in China, we explored the 
      research of factors affecting AI adoption from a social power perspective with 
      consideration of the learning algorithm abilities of AI systems. Data were 
      collected through semi-structured interviews, participative observations, and 
      document analysis, and analyzed using NVivo 11. We classified six social powers 
      into knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based power structures, revealing a social 
      power pattern related to the learning algorithm ability of AI.

AB  - AIM: Given the prolongation of the newly emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the 
      significance of caring for the patients by nursing staff, investigating and 
      planning for the different psychological dimensions of this group is of paramount 
      importance. Hence, this study investigated the role of spiritual intelligence in 
      predicting nurses' empathizing with COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This 
      descriptive-correlation study was conducted in 2021 on nurses caring for COVID-19 
      patients in three public hospitals. The researchers used two standard 
      questionnaires, including the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and Spiritual 
      Intelligence (SI), for data collection. The collected data were analyzed in 
      SPSS16 using descriptive statistics and the following: The Mann-Whitney U test, 
      Kruskal-Wallis test, Regression, chi-square test, and Pearson and Spearman 
      correlations. RESULTS: The statistical population consisted of 338 nurses with an 
      average age of 34 and ten years of work experience. There was a significant 
      positive relationship between the empathy scores and spiritual intelligence 
      scores of the nurses caring for COVID-19 patients (P¬†<¬†0.05). It was also 
      concluded from the regression analysis that, spiritual intelligence affect 
      empathy. Mean score of empathy was higher in hospitals where more nursing staff 
      had MSc degrees. There was a significant difference between the empathy scores of 
      the three hospitals (P¬†<¬†0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that there is a 
      positive relationship between empathy and spiritual intelligence. Therefor 
      improving spiritual intelligence is the appropriate strategy to ameliorate 
      empathy during the COVID19 pandemic. At the same time, study indicated attention 
      to the issue of nurses' mental health. Hence, it was suggested to incorporate 
      these issues in the training programs and national/international decisions.

AB  - In the vision of smart cities, everything is highly connected with the aid of 
      computational intelligence. Therefore, the cyber-physical society has been named 
      a computational social system for a long time. Due to the high relation with vast 
      populations' national livelihood, agriculture will still serve as a core industry 
      in the national economy. As a result, this study focused on an efficient 
      forecasting method for the agriculture economy. In recent years, the conception 
      of deep intelligence has received overall prevalence in academia because of its 
      excellent performance in implementing intelligent information processing tasks. 
      Hence, this paper utilized deep intelligence driven by neural networks and 
      managed to investigate an efficient prediction method for the agriculture economy 
      of computational social systems. To fit the time-series forecasting scene of the 
      long-term development of the agriculture economy, the convolutional neural 
      network model is slightly improved by revising its parallel structure into the 
      recurrent format. Finally, simulations on realistic datasets are carried out to 
      evaluate the proposed forecasting method.

TI  - Relationship between intelligence quotient measures and computerized 
      neurocognitive performance in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
PG  - e2221

AB  - Intelligence quotient (IQ) testing is standard for evaluating cognitive abilities 
      in genomic studies but requires professional expertise in administration and 
      interpretation, and IQ scores do not translate into insights on implicated brain 
      systems that can link genes to behavior. Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion 
      syndrome (22q11.2DS) often undergo IQ testing to address special needs, but 
      access to testing in resource-limited settings is challenging. The brief Penn 
      Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) provides measures of cognitive 
      abilities related to brain systems and can screen for cognitive dysfunction. To 
      examine the relation between CNB measures and IQ, we evaluated participants with 
      the 22q11.2DS from Philadelphia and Tel Aviv (N¬†=¬†117; 52 females; mean age 18.8) 
      who performed both an IQ test and the CNB with a maximum of 5 years between 
      administrations and a subsample (n¬†=¬†24) who had both IQ and CNB assessments at 
      two time points. We estimated domain-level CNB scores using exploratory factor 
      analysis (including bifactor for overall scores) and related those scores 
      (intraclass correlations (ICCs)) to the IQ scores. We found that the overall CNB 
      accuracy score showed similar correlations between time 1 and time 2 as IQ (0.775 
      for IQ and 0.721 for CNB accuracy), correlated well with the IQ scores 
      (ICC¬†=¬†0.565 and 0.593 for time 1 and time 2, respectively), and correlated 
      similarly with adaptive functioning (0.165 and 0.172 for IQ and CNB, 
      respectively). We provide a crosswalk (from linear equating) between standardized 
      CNB and IQ scores. Results suggest that one can substitute the CNB for IQ testing 
      in future genetic studies that aim to probe specific domains of brain-behavior 
      relations beyond IQ.

AB  - Patient-centered nursing holistic care is of utmost important to the nursing 
      profession, and humanistic care cultivation has become a global nursing education 
      concern. This study aimed to examine the relationship among emotional 
      intelligence, empathy and humanistic care ability in nursing students, and to 
      determine whether positive emotional intelligence could mediate the relationship 
      between empathy and humanistic care ability. This study used a cross-sectional, 
      descriptive design. A total of 323 nursing students was enrolled from one medical 
      university in Heilongjiang Province, China. The emotional intelligence 
      questionnaires, empathy scale and humanistic care ability scale were used to 
      quantify participants' responses. There was no significant difference in gender, 
      residence, single-child family and leader experience of nursing students' 
      humanistic care ability. However, the significant differences were found in grade 
      (t‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ4.55, P‚ÄÖ<‚ÄÖ.01) and major interests (t‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ7.06, P‚ÄÖ<‚ÄÖ.01). Obviously, there was 
      positive correlation between positive emotional intelligence and empathy 
      (R‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.37, P‚ÄÖ<‚ÄÖ.01), and positive correlation between humanistic care ability and 
      emotional intelligence (R‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.62, P‚ÄÖ<‚ÄÖ.01), and empathy (R‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.57, P‚ÄÖ<‚ÄÖ.01). 
      Furthermore, emotional intelligence (Œ≤‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ0.21, P‚ÄÖ<‚ÄÖ.01) had a significant 
      mediating effect on the relationship between humanistic care ability and empathy. 
      Nurse educators should improve the empathy of nursing students by developing and 
      implementing emotional intelligence programs, in order to improve their 
      humanistic care ability.
