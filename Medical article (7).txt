      captive parrots.

AB  - Understanding why some species thrive in captivity, while others struggle to 
      adjust, can suggest new ways to improve animal care. Approximately half of all 
      Psittaciformes, a highly threatened order, live in zoos, breeding centres and 
      private homes. Here, some species are prone to behavioural and reproductive 
      problems that raise conservation and ethical concerns. To identify risk factors, 
      we analysed data on hatching rates in breeding centres (115 species, 10 255 
      pairs) and stereotypic behaviour (SB) in private homes (50 species, 1378 
      individuals), using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs). Small captive 
      population sizes predicted low hatch rates, potentially due to genetic 
      bottlenecks, inbreeding and low availability of compatible mates. Species 
      naturally reliant on diets requiring substantial handling were most prone to 
      feather-damaging behaviours (e.g. self-plucking), indicating inadequacies in the 
      composition or presentation of feed (often highly processed). Parrot species with 
      relatively large brains were most prone to oral and whole-body SB: the first 
      empirical evidence that intelligence can confer poor captive welfare. Together, 
      results suggest that more naturalistic diets would improve welfare, and that 
      intelligent psittacines need increased cognitive stimulation. These findings 
      should help improve captive parrot care and inspire further PCM research to 
      understand species differences in responses to captivity.

TI  - LightFD: Real-Time Fault Diagnosis with Edge Intelligence for Power Transformers.
LID - 10.3390/s22145296 [doi]
LID - 5296
AB  - Power fault monitoring based on acoustic waves has gained a great deal of 
      attention in industry. Existing methods for fault diagnosis typically collect 
      sound signals on site and transmit them to a back-end server for analysis, which 
      may fail to provide a real-time response due to transmission packet loss and 
      latency. However, the limited computing power of edge devices and the existing 
      methods for feature extraction pose a significant challenge to performing 
      diagnosis on the edge. In this paper, we propose a fast Lightweight Fault 
      Diagnosis method for power transformers, referred to as LightFD, which integrates 
      several technical components. Firstly, before feature extraction, we design an 
      asymmetric Hamming-cosine window function to reduce signal spectrum leakage and 
      ensure data integrity. Secondly, we design a multidimensional spatio-temporal 
      feature extraction method to extract acoustic features. Finally, we design a 
      parallel dual-layer, dual-channel lightweight neural network to realize the 
      classification of different fault types on edge devices with limited computing 
      power. Extensive simulation and experimental results show that the diagnostic 
      precision and recall of LightFD reach 94.64% and 95.33%, which represent an 
      improvement of 4% and 1.6% over the traditional SVM method, respectively.

TI  - Utilizing geospatial intelligence and user modeling to allow for a customized 
      health awareness campaign during the pandemic: The case of COVID-19 in Saudi 
      Arabia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As of 2022, people are getting better at learning how to coexist with 
      the Covid-19 global pandemic. In Saudi Arabia, many attempts have been made to 
      raise public health awareness. However, most health awareness campaigns are 
      generic and might not influence the desired behavior among individuals. 
      OBJECTIVES: This study aims to apply geospatial intelligence and user modeling to 
      profile the districts of the city of Jeddah. This customized map can provide a 
      baseline for a customized health awareness campaign that targets the locals of 
      each district individually based on the virus spread level. METHODOLOGY: It is 
      ongoing research, which has resulted in the creation of a health messages library 
      in the first phase [1]. This paper focuses on a second phase of the research 
      study, which aims to provide a customized baseline for this campaign by applying 
      the geospatial artificial intelligence technique known as space-time cube (STC). 
      STC was applied to create a local map of the Saudi city of Jeddah, representing 
      three different profiles for the city's districts. The model is built using valid 
      COVID-19 clinical data obtained from one of Jeddah's general hospitals. RESULTS 
      AND IMPLICATIONS: When applied, STC displays three profiles for the districts of 
      Jeddah city: high infection, moderate infection, and low infection. To assess the 
      geo-intelligent map, a new instrument was created and validated. The usability 
      and practicality of this map were quantitatively evaluated in a cross-sectional 
      survey using the goal-question-metric measurement framework, and a total of 43 
      participants filled out the questionnaire. The results indicate that the 
      geo-intelligent map is suitable for everyday use, as evidenced by the 
      participants' responses. We argue that the developed instrument can also be used 
      to assess any geo-intelligence map. This research provides a legitimate approach 
      to customizing health awareness messages during pandemics.

AB  - Academic output of students is considered as a crucial element and it is affected 
      by various aspects. Teacher-class relationship, emotional intelligence and 
      generic competence are the elements which can have a considerable effect on the 
      academic output of the students. Current study was intended to find out the 
      moderating role of teacher-class relationship, emotional intelligence in the 
      academic output and generic competence of higher education students. All the 
      teachers and students of University of Sargodha were the population of the study. 
      The sample was taken from four departments of different faculties of University 
      of Sargodha i.e., Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, 
      Faculty of Arts and Humanities and Faculty of Social Sciences. For this study, a 
      sample of 21 teachers and 320 students from regular and self-support programs was 
      selected conveniently from University of Sargodha. For data collection, three 
      adapted instruments were used. Findings of current study concluded an 
      insignificant moderating role of teacher-class relationship and emotional 
      intelligence in the academic output and generic competence of students at higher 
      education. The results of present study provide guideline to curriculum 
      developers for developing the generic competence of students so that they can 
      progress in future prospects which will eventually make contribution towards 
      economy, moreover, stakeholder may take steps in order to develop the emotional 
      intelligence of students by providing them needful counseling and trainings which 
      will improve the academic output of students.

AB  - Based on the development background of the interweaving and integration of 
      computer technology and Internet technology, China's artificial intelligence 
      industry is quietly rising. In the social life of the information age, the 
      artificial intelligence industry represented by machine deep learning is playing 
      a very important role. This study in combination with the background of the new 
      health reform, in view of the reform of the medical industry, analyzes the 
      connotation of financial wisdom based on the important role of the hospital 
      financial development problems, puts forward the development direction of 
      artificial intelligence hospital financial wisdom development measures, designed 
      to meet the changing external environment demand, reduces human costs, and 
      improves the overall efficiency of hospital financial fund management. Based on 
      the evaluation results, this paper proposes the correct direction for the 
      development of hospital intelligence finance by using the BP neural network 
      model. After the analysis, it is found that the development of artificial 
      intelligence is an important measure to promote the development of hospital 
      intelligent finance. In other words, hospital intelligent financial management is 
      the product of the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology. At 
      the present stage, the intelligent financial management problems of hospitals are 
      mainly as follows: (1) lack of financial informatization, (2) lack of perfect 
      financial risk early warning system, and (3) the phenomenon of "information 
      island" in the financial system. After analyzing the above problems, the research 
      believes that the development of hospital intelligent finance based on artificial 
      intelligence needs to solve the above thorny problems, so as to improve the 
      outcome of hospital intelligent finance development. The following work should be 
      done: (1) strengthen the design of information sharing module, (2) intelligent 
      control of the cost of hospitals, and (3) intelligent treatment of hospital 
      accounting. Combining the development of artificial intelligence and hospital 
      intelligent finance theory, combined with the actual trend of financial 
      intelligence development under the background of artificial intelligence 
      development in the new era, it provides scientific basis for the development of 
      hospital intelligent finance.

LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhz091 [doi]
AB  - Fluid intelligence is the capacity to solve novel problems in the absence of 
      task-specific knowledge and is highly predictive of outcomes like educational 
      attainment and psychopathology. Here, we modeled the neurocognitive architecture 
      of fluid intelligence in two cohorts: the Centre for Attention, Leaning and 
      Memory sample (CALM) (N = 551, aged 5-17 years) and the Enhanced Nathan Kline 
      Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) (N = 335, aged 6-17 years). We used 
      multivariate structural equation modeling to test a preregistered watershed model 
      of fluid intelligence. This model predicts that white matter contributes to 
      intermediate cognitive phenotypes, like working memory and processing speed, 
      which, in turn, contribute to fluid intelligence. We found that this model 
      performed well for both samples and explained large amounts of variance in fluid 
      intelligence (R2CALM = 51.2%, R2NKI-RS = 78.3%). The relationship between 
      cognitive abilities and white matter differed with age, showing a dip in strength 
      around ages 7-12 years. This age effect may reflect a reorganization of the 
      neurocognitive architecture around pre- and early puberty. Overall, these 
      findings highlight that intelligence is part of a complex hierarchical system of 
      partially independent effects.

AB  - Much debate has concerned the separability of executive function abilities and 
      intelligence, with some evidence that the 2 constructs are genetically 
      indistinguishable in children and adolescents but phenotypically and genetically 
      distinct in older adolescents and adults. The current study leveraged data from 
      twin and adoption studies to examine executive function's genetic structure in 
      adulthood (M = 33.15 years, SD = 4.96) and its overlap with intelligence. 1,238 
      individuals (170 MZ twin pairs, 154 DZ twin pairs, 95 biological sibling pairs, 
      80 adoptive sibling pairs, and 240 unpaired individuals) completed 6 executive 
      function tasks as well as the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-III as part of 
      the Colorado Adoption/Twin study of Life span behavioral development and 
      cognitive aging (CATSLife). Results replicated the unity/diversity model of 
      executive function that distinguishes general executive function abilities 
      (Common EF) from abilities specific to working memory updating 
      (Updating-specific) and mental set shifting (Shifting-specific). In the final 
      model, broad-sense heritability was high for Common EF (h² = .72), 
      Updating-specific (h² = 1.0), and Shifting-specific (h² = .60) factors, as well 
      as for full-scale intelligence (h² = .74). Intelligence was phenotypically and 
      genetically correlated with Common EF (r = .49, broad-sense r(g) = .44) and 
      Updating-specific (r = .60, r(g) = .69) abilities. This study represents the 
      first executive function study to apply the adoption design. Leveraging the 
      combined twin and adoptive design allowed us to estimate both additive and 
      nonadditive genetic effects underlying these associations. These findings 
      highlight the commonality and separability of executive function and 
      intelligence. Common EF abilities are distinct from intelligence in adulthood, 
      with intelligence also strongly associated with Updating-specific abilities.

AB  - Understanding information processing in the brain-and creating general-purpose 
      artificial intelligence-are long-standing aspirations of scientists and engineers 
      worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level 
      cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, 
      which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of 
      building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science 
      and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical 
      formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and 
      inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of 
      internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy 
      principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal 
      computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human 
      behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol 
      emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers 
      of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like 
      intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking 
      consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of 
      learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like 
      artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of 
      how humans interact with their world.

TI  - The joint influence of intelligence and practice on skill development throughout 
      the life span.
PG  - 18363-18369
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1819086116 [doi]
AB  - The relative importance of different factors in the development of human skills 
      has been extensively discussed. Research on expertise indicates that focused 
      practice may be the sole determinant of skill, while intelligence researchers 
      underline the relative importance of abilities at even the highest level of 
      skill. There is indeed a large body of research that acknowledges the role of 
      both factors in skill development and retention. It is, however, unknown how 
      intelligence and practice come together to enable the acquisition and retention 
      of complex skills across the life span. Instead of focusing on the 2 factors, 
      intelligence and practice, in isolation, here we look at their interplay 
      throughout development. In a longitudinal study that tracked chess players 
      throughout their careers, we show that both intelligence and practice positively 
      affect the acquisition and retention of chess skill. Importantly, the nonlinear 
      interaction between the 2 factors revealed that more intelligent individuals 
      benefited more from practice. With the same amount of practice, they acquired 
      chess skill more quickly than less intelligent players, reached a higher peak 
      performance, and arrested decline in older age. Our research demonstrates the 
      futility of scrutinizing the relative importance of highly intertwined factors in 
      human development.

AB  - Sleep-wake patterns show substantial biological determination, but they are also 
      subject to individual choice and societal pressure. Some evidence suggests that 
      high IQ is associated with later sleep patterns. However, it is unclear whether 
      the relationship between IQ and later sleep is due to biological or social 
      effects, such as the timing of working hours. We investigated the association 
      between habitual sleep timing during work days and work-free days, working time 
      and membership in Mensa, an organization of highly intelligent individuals 
      (IQ  ≥130) using a sample of 1,172 adults split between Mensa members and age- 
      and sex-matched volunteers from a large web-based database. We found no 
      difference in chronotype, and the later sleep timing of Mensa members on work 
      days was fully accounted for by later work start times. Our results indicate that 
      later sleep timing in those with higher IQs is not due to physiological 
      differences, but rather due to later work schedules. Later working times and the 
      resulting lower social jetlag may be one of the reasons why higher IQ is 
      associated with lower prospective morbidity and mortality.
