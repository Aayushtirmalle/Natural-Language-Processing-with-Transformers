TI  - Developing an Artificial Intelligence-Based Pediatric and Adolescent Migraine 
      Diagnostic Model.
PG  - e44415
LID - 10.7759/cureus.44415 [doi]
LID - e44415
AB  - Introduction Misdiagnosis of pediatric and adolescent migraine is a significant 
      problem. The first artificial intelligence (AI)-based pediatric migraine 
      diagnosis model was made utilizing a database of questionnaires obtained from a 
      previous epidemiological study, the Itoigawa Benizuwaigani Study. Methods The 
      AI-based headache diagnosis model was created based on the internal validation 
      based on a retrospective investigation of 909 patients (636 training dataset for 
      model development and 273 test dataset for internal validation) aged six to 17 
      years diagnosed based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders 
      3rd edition. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was evaluated. Results 
      The dataset included 234/909 (25.7%) pediatric or adolescent patients with 
      migraine. The mean age was 11.3 (standard deviation 3.17) years. The model's 
      accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F-values for the test 
      dataset were 94.5%, 88.7%, 96.5%, 90.0%, and 89.4%, respectively. Conclusions The 
      AI model exhibited high diagnostic performance for pediatric and adolescent 
      migraine. It holds great potential as a powerful tool for diagnosing these 
      conditions, especially when secondary headaches are ruled out. Nonetheless, 
      further data collection and external validation are necessary to enhance the 
      model's performance and ensure its applicability in real-world settings.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Childcare: Assessing the Performance and Acceptance of 
      ChatGPT Responses.
PG  - e44484
LID - 10.7759/cureus.44484 [doi]
LID - e44484
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the performance and acceptance of responses 
      generated by ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to Japanese childcare-related questions to 
      assess their potential applicability and limitations in the childcare field, 
      specifically focusing on the accuracy, usefulness, and empathy of the generated 
      answers. Methods We evaluated answers in Japanese generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 
      for two types of childcare-related questions. ① For the written examination 
      questions of Japan's childcare worker national examination for 2023's fiscal 
      year, we calculated the correct answer rates using official answers. ② We 
      selected one question from each of the seven categories from the child-rearing 
      questions posted on the Japanese National Childcare Workers Association's website 
      and had GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 generate answers. These were evaluated alongside 
      existing childcare worker answers by human professionals. Five childcare workers 
      then blindly selected what they considered the best answer among the three and 
      rated them on a five-point scale for 'accuracy,' 'usefulness,' and 'empathy.' 
      Results In the examination consisting of 160 written questions, both GPT-3.5 and 
      GPT-4 produced responses to all 155 questions, excluding four questions omitted 
      due to copyright concerns and one question deemed invalid due to inherent flaws 
      in the question itself, with correct answer rates of 30.3% for GPT-3.5 and 47.7% 
      for GPT-4 (p<0.01). For the child-rearing Q&A questions, childcare worker answers 
      by human professionals were chosen as the best answer most frequently (45.7%), 
      followed by GPT-3.5 (31.4%) and GPT-4 (22.9%). While GPT-3.5 received the highest 
      average rating for accuracy (3.69 points), childcare worker answers by human 
      professionals received the highest average ratings for usefulness and empathy 
      (both 3.57 points). Conclusions Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 failed to meet the passing 
      criteria in Japan's childcare worker national examination, and for the 
      child-rearing questions, GPT-3.5 was rated higher in accuracy despite lower 
      correct answer rates. Over half of the childcare workers considered the 
      ChatGPT-generated answers to be the best ones, yet concerns about accuracy were 
      observed, highlighting the potential risk of incorrect information in the 
      Japanese context.

PG  - e20356
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20356 [doi]
LID - e20356
AB  - Emotional intelligence (EI) has been widely researched in different fields of 
      knowledge. This paper reviews the literature on emotional intelligence, 
      leadership, and teams in 104 peer-reviewed articles and reviews provided by the 
      Web of Science and Scopus databases from 1998 to 2022. It is a hybrid or mixed 
      review as it uses both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The aims 
      of this study are a performance analysis of the selected documents (years of 
      publication, country, sectors, techniques used, most cited authors, authors with 
      more publications, journals, journal quartiles, and scope of publication), as 
      well as a co-word analysis using Atlas. ti v8. The results of the quantitative 
      analysis indicate that the majority are empirical works. The qualitative analysis 
      is a co-word analysis providing the following results: (i) classification of 
      authors by major themes-categories (EI, leadership, team), (ii) classification of 
      themes within each major theme: three subcategories in EI, 17 subcategories in 
      leadership, and 19 subcategories in team and, lastly, (iii) classification 
      according to the chronological development of main objectives from the most cited 
      authors' articles we analyzed. Leadership (transformational, emergence, virtual, 
      effective, health, effectiveness) is the major theme we studied. Our in-depth 
      review of the articles has shown that emotionally intelligent leaders improve 
      both behaviors and business results and have an impact on work team performance. 
      It also highlighted a positive relationship between emotional competence and team 
      members' attitudes about work. The new trends focus on the impacts of COVID19, 
      the global crisis due to the Ukraine War, working in VUCA and BANI environments, 
      comparative studies between generations, the application of artificial 
      intelligence and the influence of mindfulness on organizations.

TI  - Benchmarking ChatGPT-4 on a radiation oncology in-training exam and Red Journal 
      Gray Zone cases: potentials and challenges for ai-assisted medical education and 
      decision making in radiation oncology.
PG  - 1265024
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2023.1265024 [doi]
LID - 1265024
AB  - PURPOSE: The potential of large language models in medicine for education and 
      decision-making purposes has been demonstrated as they have achieved decent 
      scores on medical exams such as the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) 
      and the MedQA exam. This work aims to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT-4 in 
      the specialized field of radiation oncology. METHODS: The 38th American College 
      of Radiology (ACR) radiation oncology in-training (TXIT) exam and the 2022 Red 
      Journal Gray Zone cases are used to benchmark the performance of ChatGPT-4. The 
      TXIT exam contains 300 questions covering various topics of radiation oncology. 
      The 2022 Gray Zone collection contains 15 complex clinical cases. RESULTS: For 
      the TXIT exam, ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 have achieved the scores of 62.05% and 
      78.77%, respectively, highlighting the advantage of the latest ChatGPT-4 model. 
      Based on the TXIT exam, ChatGPT-4's strong and weak areas in radiation oncology 
      are identified to some extent. Specifically, ChatGPT-4 demonstrates better 
      knowledge of statistics, CNS & eye, pediatrics, biology, and physics than 
      knowledge of bone & soft tissue and gynecology, as per the ACR knowledge domain. 
      Regarding clinical care paths, ChatGPT-4 performs better in diagnosis, prognosis, 
      and toxicity than brachytherapy and dosimetry. It lacks proficiency in in-depth 
      details of clinical trials. For the Gray Zone cases, ChatGPT-4 is able to suggest 
      a personalized treatment approach to each case with high correctness and 
      comprehensiveness. Importantly, it provides novel treatment aspects for many 
      cases, which are not suggested by any human experts. CONCLUSION: Both evaluations 
      demonstrate the potential of ChatGPT-4 in medical education for the general 
      public and cancer patients, as well as the potential to aid clinical 
      decision-making, while acknowledging its limitations in certain domains. Owing to 
      the risk of hallucinations, it is essential to verify the content generated by 
      models such as ChatGPT for accuracy.

TI  - Predicting Patients Requiring Treatment for Depression in the Postpartum Period 
      Using Common Electronic Medical Record Data Available Antepartum.
PG  - 100100

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depression requiring treatment in the postpartum period 
      significantly impacts maternal and neonatal health. Although preventive 
      management of depression in pregnancy has been shown to decrease the negative 
      impacts, current methods for identifying at-risk patients are insufficient. Given 
      the complexity of the diagnosis and interplay of clinical/demographic factors, we 
      tested whether machine learning techniques can accurately identify at-risk 
      patients in the postpartum period. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study 
      of the NIH Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be, which 
      enrolled 10,038 nulliparous people. The primary outcome was depression in the 
      postpartum period. We constructed and optimized 4 machine learning models using 
      distributed random forest modeling and 1 logistic regression model on the basis 
      of the NIH Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be 
      dataset. Model 1 utilized only readily obtainable sociodemographic data. Model 2 
      added maternal prepregnancy mental health data. Model 3 utilized recursive 
      feature elimination to construct a parsimonious model. Model 4 further titrated 
      the input data to simplify prepregnancy mental health variables. The logistic 
      regression model used the same input data as Model 3 as a proof of concept. 
      RESULTS: Of 8,454 births, 338 (4%) were complicated by depression in the 
      postpartum period. Model 3 was the highest performing, showing the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.91 (±0.02). Models 1-3 identified 
      the 9 variables most predictive of depression hierarchically, ranging from 
      depression history (highest), history of mental health condition, recent 
      psychiatric medication use, BMI, income, age, anxiety history, education, and 
      preparedness for pregnancy (lowest). In Model 4, the area under the receiver 
      operating characteristics curve remained at 0.79 (±0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Postpartum 
      depression can be predicted with high accuracy for individual patients using 
      antepartum information commonly found in electronic medical records. In addition, 
      baseline mental health status and sociodemographic factors have a larger role in 
      the postpartum period than previously understood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common 
      endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age and remains widely underdiagnosed 
      leading to significant morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
      learning (ML) hold promise in improving diagnostics. Thus, we performed a 
      systematic review of literature to identify the utility of AI/ML in the diagnosis 
      or classification of PCOS. METHODS: We applied a search strategy using the 
      following databases MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, the Web of Science, and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library using relevant 
      keywords. Eligible studies were identified, and results were extracted for their 
      synthesis from inception until January 1, 2022. RESULTS: 135 studies were 
      screened and ultimately, 31 studies were included in this study. Data sources 
      used by the AI/ML interventions included clinical data, electronic health 
      records, and genetic and proteomic data. Ten studies (32%) employed standardized 
      criteria (NIH, Rotterdam, or Revised International PCOS classification), while 17 
      (55%) used clinical information with/without imaging. The most common AI 
      techniques employed were support vector machine (42% studies), K-nearest neighbor 
      (26%), and regression models (23%) were the commonest AI/ML. Receiver operating 
      curves (ROC) were employed to compare AI/ML with clinical diagnosis. Area under 
      the ROC ranged from 73% to 100% (n=7 studies), diagnostic accuracy from 89% to 
      100% (n=4 studies), sensitivity from 41% to 100% (n=10 studies), specificity from 
      75% to 100% (n=10 studies), positive predictive value (PPV) from 68% to 95% (n=4 
      studies), and negative predictive value (NPV) from 94% to 99% (n=2 studies). 
      CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence and machine learning provide a high 
      diagnostic and classification performance in detecting PCOS, thereby providing an 
      avenue for early diagnosis of this disorder. However, AI-based studies should use 
      standardized PCOS diagnostic criteria to enhance the clinical applicability of 
      AI/ML in PCOS and improve adherence to methodological and reporting guidelines 
      for maximum diagnostic utility. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

      epileptic seizure prediction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by sudden, 
      unprovoked seizures. The unexpected nature of epileptic seizures is a major 
      component of the disease burden. Predicting seizure onset and alarming patients 
      may allow timely intervention, which would improve clinical outcomes and patient 
      quality of life. Currently, algorithms aiming to predict seizures suffer from a 
      high false alarm rate, rendering them unsuitable for clinical use. METHODS: We 
      adopted here a risk-controlling prediction calibration method called Learn then 
      Test to reduce false alarm rates of seizure prediction. This method calibrates 
      the output of a "black-box" model to meet a specified false alarm rate 
      requirement. The method was initially validated on synthetic data and 
      subsequently tested on publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) records from 
      15 patients with epilepsy by calibrating the outputs of a deep learning model. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Validation showed that the calibration method rigorously 
      controlled the false alarm rate at a user-desired level after our adaptation. 
      Real data testing showed an average of 92% reduction in the false alarm rate, at 
      the cost of missing four of nine seizures of six patients. Better-performing 
      prediction models combined with the proposed method may facilitate the clinical 
      use of real-time seizure prediction systems.

TI  - Machine learning based prediction of prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation 
      incorporating medication data.
LID - 2023.09.18.23295724 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.09.18.23295724 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Duration of mechanical ventilation is associated with adverse outcomes 
      in critically ill patients and increased use of resources. The increasing 
      complexity of medication regimens has been associated with increased mortality, 
      length of stay, and fluid overload but has never been studied specifically in the 
      setting of mechanical ventilation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis was to 
      develop prediction models for mechanical ventilation duration to test the 
      hypothesis that incorporating medication data may improve model performance. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted to the ICU and 
      undergoing mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hours from October 2015 to 
      October 2020. Patients were excluded if it was not their index ICU admission or 
      if the patient was placed on comfort care in the first 24 hours of admission. 
      Relevant patient characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, admission 
      diagnosis, morbidities, vital signs measurements, severity of illness, medication 
      regimen complexity as measured by the MRC-ICU, and medical treatments before 
      intubation were collected. The primary outcome was area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (AUROC) of prediction models for prolonged mechanical 
      ventilation (defined as greater than 5 days). Both logistic regression and 
      supervised learning techniques including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support 
      Vector Machine were used to develop prediction models. RESULTS: The 318 patients 
      [age 59.9 (SD 16.9), female 39.3%, medical 28.6%] had mean 24-hour MRC-ICU score 
      of 21.3 (10.5), mean APACHE II score of 21.0 (5.4), mean SOFA score of 9.9 (3.3), 
      and ICU mortality rate of 22.6% (n=72). The strongest performing logistic model 
      was the base model with MRC-ICU added, with AUROC of 0.72, positive predictive 
      value (PPV) of 0.83, and negative prediction value (NPV) of 0.92. The strongest 
      overall model was Random Forest with an AUROC of 0.78, a PPV of 0.53, and NPV of 
      0.90. Feature importance analysis using support vector machine and Random Forest 
      revealed severity of illness scores and medication related data were the most 
      important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Medication regimen complexity is significantly 
      associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill 
      patients, and prediction models incorporating medication information showed 
      modest improvement in this prediction.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in an increasing number of areas, with 
      recent interest in generative AI, such as using ChatGPT to generate programming 
      code or DALL-E to make illustrations. We describe the use of generative AI in 
      medical education. Specifically, we sought to determine whether generative AI 
      could help train pediatric residents to better recognize genetic conditions. From 
      publicly available images of individuals with genetic conditions, we used 
      generative AI methods to create new images, which were checked for accuracy with 
      an external classifier. We selected two conditions for study, Kabuki (KS) and 
      Noonan (NS) syndromes, which are clinically important conditions that 
      pediatricians may encounter. In this study, pediatric residents completed 208 
      surveys, where they each classified 20 images following exposure to one of 4 
      possible educational interventions, including with and without generative AI 
      methods. Overall, we find that generative images perform similarly but appear to 
      be slightly less helpful than real images. Most participants reported that images 
      were useful, although real images were felt to be more helpful. We conclude that 
      generative AI images may serve as an adjunctive educational tool, particularly 
      for less familiar conditions, such as KS.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence have paved the way for leveraging hematoxylin 
      and eosin (H&E)-stained tumor slides for precision oncology. We present 
      ENLIGHT-DeepPT, an approach for predicting response to multiple targeted and 
      immunotherapies from H&E-slides. In difference from existing approaches that aim 
      to predict treatment response directly from the slides, ENLIGHT-DeepPT is an 
      indirect two-step approach consisting of (1) DeepPT, a new deep-learning 
      framework that predicts genome-wide tumor mRNA expression from slides, and (2) 
      ENLIGHT, which predicts response based on the DeepPT inferred expression values. 
      DeepPT successfully predicts transcriptomics in all 16 TCGA cohorts tested and 
      generalizes well to two independent datasets. Our key contribution is showing 
      that ENLIGHT-DeepPT successfully predicts true responders in five independent 
      patients' cohorts involving four different treatments spanning six cancer types 
      with an overall odds ratio of 2.44, increasing the baseline response rate by 
      43.47% among predicted responders, without the need for any treatment data for 
      training. Furthermore, its prediction accuracy on these datasets is comparable to 
      a supervised approach predicting the response directly from the images, which 
      needs to be trained and tested on the same cohort. ENLIGHT-DeepPT future 
      application could provide clinicians with rapid treatment recommendations to an 
      array of different therapies and importantly, may contribute to advancing 
      precision oncology in developing countries.
