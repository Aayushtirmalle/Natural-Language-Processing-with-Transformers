Journal Title: Current anesthesiology reports
Publication Date: 2023 Jun
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current research and critically examine artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their applicability to the daily practice of anesthesiologists. RECENT FINDINGS: Novel AI tools are developed using data from electronic health records, imaging, waveforms, clinical notes, and wearables. These tools can accurately predict the perioperative risk for adverse outcomes, the need for blood transfusion, and the risk of difficult intubation. Intraoperatively, AI models can assist with technical skill augmentation, patient monitoring, and management. Postoperatively, AI technology can aid in preventing complications and discharge planning. While further prospective validation is needed, these early applications demonstrate promise in every area of perioperative care. SUMMARY: The practice of anesthesiology is at a precipice fueled by technological innovation. The clinical AI implementation would enable personalized and safer patient care by offering actionable insights from the wealth of perioperative data.

Title: Evaluating Progression Risk in Patients With Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy.
Author: ['Cattran DC', 'Floege J', 'Coppo R']
Journal Title: Kidney international reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: The highly variable rate of decline in kidney function in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) provides a major clinical challenge. Predicting which patients will progress to kidney failure, and how quickly, is difficult. Multiple novel therapies are likely to be approved in the short-term, but clinicians lack the tools to identify patients most likely to benefit from specific treatments at the right time. Noninvasive and validated markers for selecting at-risk patients and longitudinal monitoring are urgently needed. This review summarizes what is known about demographic, clinical, and histopathologic prognostic markers in the clinician's toolkit, including the International IgAN Prediction Tool. We also briefly review what is known on these topics in children and adolescents with IgAN. Although helpful, currently used markers leave clinicians heavily reliant on histologic features from the diagnostic kidney biopsy and standard clinical data to guide treatment choice, and very few noninvasive markers reflect treatment efficacy over time. Novel prognostic and predictive markers are under clinical investigation, with considerable progress being made in markers of complement activation. Other areas of research are the interplay between gut microbiota and galactose-deficient IgA1 expression; microRNAs; imaging; artificial intelligence; and markers of fibrosis. Given the rate of therapeutic advancement, the remaining gaps in biomarker research need to be addressed. We finish by describing our route to clinical utility of predictive and prognostic markers in IgAN. This route will provide us with the chance to improve IgAN prognosis by using robust, clinically practical markers to inform patient care.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, driven primarily by coronary artery disease (CAD). ASCVD risk estimators such as the pooled cohort equations (PCE) facilitate risk stratification and primary prevention of ASCVD but their accuracy is still suboptimal. METHODS: Using deep electronic health record data from 7,116,209 patients seen at 70+ hospitals and clinics across 5 states in the USA, we developed an artificial intelligence-based electrocardiogram analysis tool (ECG-AI) to detect CAD and assessed the additive value of ECG-AI-based ASCVD risk stratification to the PCE. We created independent ECG-AI models using separate neural networks including subjects without known history of ASCVD, to identify coronary artery calcium (CAC) score >/=300 Agatston units by computed tomography, obstructive CAD by angiography or procedural intervention, and regional left ventricular akinesis in >/=1 segment by echocardiogram, as a reflection of possible prior myocardial infarction (MI). These were used to assess the utility of ECG-AI-based ASCVD risk stratification in a retrospective observational study consisting of patients with PCE scores and no prior ASCVD. The study period covered all available digitized EHR data, with the first available ECG in 1987 and the last in February 2023. FINDINGS: ECG-AI for identifying CAC >/=300, obstructive CAD, and regional akinesis achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.94, respectively. An ensembled ECG-AI identified 3, 5, and 10-year risk for acute coronary events and mortality independently and additively to PCE. Hazard ratios for acute coronary events over 3-years in patients without ASCVD that tested positive on 1, 2, or 3 versus 0 disease-specific ECG-AI models at cohort entry were 2.41 (2.14-2.71), 4.23 (3.74-4.78), and 11.75 (10.2-13.52), respectively. Similar stratification was observed in cohorts stratified by PCE or age. INTERPRETATION: ECG-AI has potential to address unmet need for accessible risk stratification in patients in whom PCE under, over, or insufficiently estimates ASCVD risk, and in whom risk assessment over time periods shorter than 10 years is desired.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prognosis is crucial for personalized treatment and surveillance suggestion of the resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in stage I-III. Although the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is a powerful predictor, it is not perfect enough to accurately distinguish all the patients, especially within the same TNM stage. In this study, we developed an intelligent prognosis evaluation system (IPES) using pre-therapy CT images to assist the traditional TNM staging system for more accurate prognosis prediction of resected NSCLC patients. METHODS: 20,333 CT images of 6371 patients from June 12, 2009 to March 24, 2022 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Mianzhu People's Hospital, Peking University People's Hospital, Chengdu Shangjin Nanfu Hospital and Guangan Peoples' Hospital were included in this retrospective study. We developed the IPES based on self-supervised pre-training and multi-task learning, which aimed to predict an overall survival (OS) risk for each patient. We further evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the IPES and its ability to stratify NSCLC patients with the same TNM stage and with the same EGFR genotype. FINDINGS: The IPES was able to predict OS risk for stage I-III resected NSCLC patients in the training set (C-index 0.806; 95% CI: 0.744-0.846), internal validation set (0.783; 95% CI: 0.744-0.825) and external validation set (0.817; 95% CI: 0.786-0.849). In addition, IPES performed well in early-stage (stage I) and EGFR genotype prediction. Furthermore, by adopting IPES-based survival score (IPES-score), resected NSCLC patients in the same stage or with the same EGFR genotype could be divided into low- and high-risk subgroups with good and poor prognosis, respectively (p < 0.05 for all). INTERPRETATION: The IPES provided a non-invasive way to obtain prognosis-related information from patients. The identification of IPES for resected NSCLC patients with low and high prognostic risk in the same TNM stage or with the same EGFR genotype suggests that IPES have potential to offer more personalized treatment and surveillance suggestion for NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Pediatric brain and spinal cancers remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Advancements in clinical decision-support in pediatric neuro-oncology utilizing the wealth of radiology imaging data collected through standard care, however, has significantly lagged other domains. Such data is ripe for use with predictive analytics such as artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which require large datasets. To address this unmet need, we provide a multi-institutional, large-scale pediatric dataset of 23,101 multi-parametric MRI exams acquired through routine care for 1,526 brain tumor patients, as part of the Children's Brain Tumor Network. This includes longitudinal MRIs across various cancer diagnoses, with associated patient-level clinical information, digital pathology slides, as well as tissue genotype and omics data. To facilitate downstream analysis, treatment-naive images for 370 subjects were processed and released through the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative via the Cancer Data Service. Through ongoing efforts to continuously build these imaging repositories, our aim is to accelerate discovery and translational AI models with real-world data, to ultimately empower precision medicine for children.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact of dentofacial deformity on an individual's chances of being hired for a hypothetical job involving customer service. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Face photographs (frontal and lateral) of 15 patients with moderate to severe dentofacial deformity, taken before and after orthodontic-surgical correction, were selected and randomized between two different questionnaires. In addition, five patients without dentofacial deformity were used as controls in both questionnaires. These questionnaires were taken by adults responsible for hiring personnel to work in commerce and business activities, graduates or postgraduates in business administration, with experience in recruiting and hiring personnel. The evaluation took place using a Likert scale with values ranging from 0 to 10 (in which 0 corresponded to complete disagreement and 10 to complete agreement), considering the following variables in a first impression judgment: honesty, intelligence, productivity at work, and hiring chance. Data were tabulated and statistical analysis was performed using a linear regression model for the explanatory variables that showed statistical significance in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effect size through Cohen's d has been corrected for all comparisons performed. RESULTS: All re-examined domains demonstrated statistical differences even when included in a multivariate model (p < 0.05), with lower mean values for those requiring pre-treatment (presenting deformity), although the effect size was small for all comparisons. CONCLUSION: Dentofacial deformity influenced the hiring chance, although not appearing to be a preponderant factor for hiring, acting as a tiebreaker among the candidates adopted.

Title: The influence of conversational agents' role and communication style on user experience.
Author: ['Poivet R', 'Lopez Malet M', 'Pelachaud C', 'Auvray M']
Journal Title: Frontiers in psychology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Conversational Agents (CAs) are characterized by their roles within a narrative and the communication style they adopt during conversations. Within computer games, users' evaluation of the narrative is influenced by their estimation of CAs' intelligence and believability. However, the impact of CAs' roles and communication styles on users' experience remains unclear. This research investigates such influence of CAs' roles and communication styles through a crime-solving textual game. Four different CAs were developed and each of them was assigned to a role of either witness or suspect and to a communication style than can be either aggressive or cooperative. Communication styles were simulated through a Wizard of Oz method. Users' task was to interact, through real-time written exchanges, with the four CAs and then to identify the culprit, assess the certainty of their judgments, and rank the CAs based on their conversational preferences. In addition, users' experience was evaluated using perceptual measures (perceived intelligence and believability scales) and behavioral measures (including analysis of users' input length, input delay, and conversation length). The results revealed that users' evaluation of CAs' intelligence and believability was primarily influenced by CAs' roles. On the other hand, users' conversational behaviors were mainly influenced by CAs' communication styles. CAs' communication styles also significantly determined users' choice of the culprit and conversational preferences.

Journal Title: Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel imaging method for detecting iron content in the brain. The study aimed determine whether the iron deposition in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is correlated with freezing of gait (FOG). METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 24 patients with PD from the Movement Disorders Program and 36 healthy controls (HCs) from January 2021 to December 2021. Clinical assessments included mental intelligence scales, Parkinson rating scales, motor-related scales, and clinical gait assessments. All exercise scales and gait assessments were performed in the "ON" and "OFF" states. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected using 3-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequences. We chose the bilateral red nucleus, substantia nigra, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus as regions of interest for QSM analysis. RESULTS: The iron deposition in the substantia nigra of the PD group was significantly higher than that of the HC group (P<0.01). In the PD group, the iron deposition in the substantia nigra of patients with FOG was significantly higher than that in patients without FOG (P=0.04). The iron deposition in the substantia nigra was positively correlated with the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (P=0.03). The scores for depression and anxiety of the PD group were significantly higher than those of the HC group, while the Berg balance scale score was significantly lower (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The iron deposition in the substantia nigra of patients with PD is increased compared with that of controls and is associated with FOG. QSM can be used to detect brain iron deposition in patients with PD, which would help to explore the mechanism of abnormal neurobiological activity in FOG.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pericoronary artery coronary tissue (PACT) is a type of epicardial fat that can reflect the state of the coronary artery (inflammation, etc.). However, it cannot be reasonably and efficiently utilized in routine computed tomography (CT) examination. The aim of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) software to analyze coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and measure the coronary perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) of patients. The relationship between FAI and the occurrence of coronary adverse events and the degree of coronary stenosis were further analyzed. METHODS: This study involved patients who experienced CCTA in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 2012 to December 2012. These patients were followed up to 2020 and classified according to the occurrence of coronary adverse events and the degree of stenosis of the lumen. For all patients, AI software was used to analyze the CCTA images of patients, and the FAI of 3 coronary arteries, the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA), was measured. Moreover, the relationship between FAI and patients with different degrees of coronary stenosis and adverse coronary events was determined. RESULTS: Comparisons between any 2 groups showed that the differences in the FAI among the 4 groups for the LAD were significant (all P values <0.05). There were no significant differences between the group with less-than-moderate stenosis (Mb) without adverse events and the group with moderate-or-above stenosis (M) with no adverse events for the LCX (P>0.05). For the remaining groups, FAI values exhibited statistically significant differences (P<0.05). According to the degree of lumen stenosis, the patients were divided into groups according to LAD, LCX, and RCA and the sum of the 3 vessels. There were significant differences in coronary FAI among the groups with different degrees of lumen stenosis for the sum of the 3 vessels, the LAD, and the LCX (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FAI can reflect the state of the coronary artery, which is related to inflammation of the coronary lumen. Moreover, there is a relationship between FAI and the degree of stenosis in the coronary lumen: the narrower the coronary lumen is, the higher the FAI around the lumen.

Journal Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Computational analysis of paratope-epitope interactions between antibodies and their corresponding antigens can facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying humoral immunity and boost the design of new therapeutics for many diseases. The recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence has made it possible to predict protein-protein interactions and model their structures. Unfortunately, detecting antigen-binding sites associated with a specific antibody is still a challenging problem. To tackle this challenge, we implemented a deep learning model to characterize interaction patterns between antibodies and their corresponding antigens. With high accuracy, our model can distinguish between antibody-antigen complexes and other types of protein-protein complexes. More intriguingly, we can identify antigens from other common protein binding regions with an accuracy of higher than 70% even if we only have the epitope information. This indicates that antigens have distinct features on their surface that antibodies can recognize. Additionally, our model was unable to predict the partnerships between antibodies and their particular antigens. This result suggests that one antigen may be targeted by more than one antibody and that antibodies may bind to previously unidentified proteins. Taken together, our results support the precision of antibody-antigen interactions while also suggesting positive future progress in the prediction of specific pairing.

Journal Title: Research square
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: While artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), offers significant potential for medicine, it raises critical concerns due to the possibility of generating factually incorrect information, leading to potential long-term risks and ethical issues. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the faithfulness problem in existing research on AI in healthcare and medicine, with a focus on the analysis of the causes of unfaithful results, evaluation metrics, and mitigation methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using PRISMA methodology, we sourced 5,061 records from five databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar) published between January 2018 to March 2023. We removed duplicates and screened records based on exclusion criteria. RESULTS: With 40 leaving articles, we conducted a systematic review of recent developments aimed at optimizing and evaluating factuality across a variety of generative medical AI approaches. These include knowledge-grounded LLMs, text-to-text generation, multimodality-to-text generation, and automatic medical fact-checking tasks. DISCUSSION: Current research investigating the factuality problem in medical AI is in its early stages. There are significant challenges related to data resources, backbone models, mitigation methods, and evaluation metrics. Promising opportunities exist for novel faithful medical AI research involving the adaptation of LLMs and prompt engineering. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive review highlights the need for further research to address the issues of reliability and factuality in medical AI, serving as both a reference and inspiration for future research into the safe, ethical use of AI in medicine and healthcare.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A range of rare mutations involving micro-deletion or -duplication of genetic material (copy number variants (CNVs)) have been associated with high neurodevelopmental and psychiatric risk (ND-CNVs). Irritability is frequently observed in childhood neurodevelopmental conditions, yet its aetiology is largely unknown. Genetic variation may play a role, but there is a sparsity of studies investigating presentation of irritability in young people with ND-CNVs. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in irritability in young people with rare ND-CNVs compared to those without ND-CNVs, and to what extent irritability is associated with psychiatric diagnoses and cognitive ability (IQ). METHODS: Irritability and broader psychopathology was assessed in 485 young people with ND-CNVs and 164 sibling controls, using the child and adolescent psychiatric assessment (CAPA). Autism was assessed using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). RESULTS: 54% of young people with ND-CNVs met the threshold for irritability; significantly more than controls (OR = 3.77, CI = 3.07-7.90, p= 5.31 x 10(-11)). When controlling for the presence of other psychiatric comorbidities, ND-CNV status was still associated with irritability. There was no evidence for a relationship between irritability and IQ. CONCLUSIONS: Irritability is an important aspect of the clinical picture in young people with ND-CNVs. This work shows that genetic variation is associated with irritability in young people with ND-CNVs, independent of psychiatric comorbidities or IQ impairment. Clinicians should be aware of this increased risk to inform management and interventions.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Skeletal muscle fat infiltration progresses with aging and is worsened among individuals with a history of cigarette smoking. Many negative impacts of smoking on muscles are likely reversible with smoking cessation. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the progression of skeletal muscle fat infiltration with aging is altered by smoking cessation among lung cancer screening participants. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis based on the National Lung Screening Trial. Skeletal muscle attenuation in Hounsfield unit (HU) was derived from the baseline and follow-up low-dose CT scans using a previously validated artificial intelligence algorithm. Lower attenuation indicates greater fatty infiltration. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to evaluate the associations between smoking status and the muscle attenuation trajectory. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 19,019 included participants (age: 61 years, 5 [SD]; 11,290 males), 8,971 (47.2%) were actively smoking cigarettes. Accounting for body mass index, pack-years, percent emphysema, and other confounding factors, actively smoking predicted a lower attenuation in both males (beta(0) =-0.88 HU, P<.001) and females (beta(0) =-0.69 HU, P<.001), and an accelerated muscle attenuation decline-rate in males (beta(1)=-0.08 HU/y, P<.05). Age-stratified analyses indicated that the accelerated muscle attenuation decline associated with smoking likely occurred at younger age, especially in females. CONCLUSIONS: Among lung cancer screening participants, active cigarette smoking was associated with greater skeletal muscle fat infiltration in both males and females, and accelerated muscle adipose accumulation rate in males. These findings support the important role of smoking cessation in preserving muscle health.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Pain is a challenging multifaceted symptom reported by most cancer patients, resulting in a substantial burden on both patients and healthcare systems. This systematic review aims to explore applications of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in predicting pain-related outcomes and supporting decision-making processes in pain management in cancer. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was conducted using terms including "Cancer", "Pain", "Pain Management", "Analgesics", "Opioids", "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning", and "Neural Networks" published up to September 7, 2023. The screening process was performed using the Covidence screening tool. Only original studies conducted in human cohorts were included. AI/ML models, their validation and performance and adherence to TRIPOD guidelines were summarized from the final included studies. RESULTS: This systematic review included 44 studies from 2006-2023. Most studies were prospective and uni-institutional. There was an increase in the trend of AI/ML studies in cancer pain in the last 4 years. Nineteen studies used AI/ML for classifying cancer patients' pain development after cancer therapy, with median AUC 0.80 (range 0.76-0.94). Eighteen studies focused on cancer pain research with median AUC 0.86 (range 0.50-0.99), and 7 focused on applying AI/ML for cancer pain management decisions with median AUC 0.71 (range 0.47-0.89). Multiple ML models were investigated with. median AUC across all models in all studies (0.77). Random forest models demonstrated the highest performance (median AUC 0.81), lasso models had the highest median sensitivity (1), while Support Vector Machine had the highest median specificity (0.74). Overall adherence of included studies to TRIPOD guidelines was 70.7%. Lack of external validation (14%) and clinical application (23%) of most included studies was detected. Reporting of model calibration was also missing in the majority of studies (5%). CONCLUSION: Implementation of various novel AI/ML tools promises significant advances in the classification, risk stratification, and management decisions for cancer pain. These advanced tools will integrate big health-related data for personalized pain management in cancer patients. Further research focusing on model calibration and rigorous external clinical validation in real healthcare settings is imperative for ensuring its practical and reliable application in clinical practice.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a rare but lethal cancer. Recent evidence reveals that pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), the microscopic precursor lesions in the pancreatic ducts that can give rise to invasive pancreatic cancer, are significantly larger and more prevalent than previously believed. Better understanding of the growth law dynamics of PanINs may improve our ability to understand how a miniscule fraction of these lesions makes the transition to invasive cancer. Here, using artificial intelligence (AI)-based three-dimensional (3D) tissue mapping method, we measured the volumes of >1,000 PanIN and found that lesion size is distributed according to a power law with a fitted exponent of -1.7 over > 3 orders of magnitude. Our data also suggest that PanIN growth is not very sensitive to the pancreatic microenvironment or an individual's age, family history, and lifestyle, and is rather shaped by general growth behavior. We analyze several models of PanIN growth and fit the predicted size distributions to the observed data. The best fitting models suggest that both intraductal spread of PanIN lesions and fusing of multiple lesions into large, highly branched structures drive PanIN growth patterns. This work lays the groundwork for future mathematical modeling efforts integrating PanIN incidence, morphology, genomic, and transcriptomic features to understand pancreas tumorigenesis, and demonstrates the utility of combining experimental measurement of human tissues with dynamic modeling for understanding cancer tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Profiling the binding of T cell receptors (TCRs) of T cells to antigenic peptides presented by MHC proteins is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern immunology. Experimental methods to probe TCR-antigen interactions are slow, labor-intensive, costly, and yield moderate throughput. To address this problem, we developed pMTnet-omni, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system based on hybrid protein sequence and structure information, to predict the pairing of TCRs of alphabeta T cells with peptide-MHC complexes (pMHCs). pMTnet-omni is capable of handling peptides presented by both class I and II pMHCs, and capable of handling both human and mouse TCR-pMHC pairs, through information sharing enabled this hybrid design. pMTnet-omni achieves a high overall Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operator Characteristics (AUROC) of 0.888, which surpasses competing tools by a large margin. We showed that pMTnet-omni can distinguish binding affinity of TCRs with similar sequences. Across a range of datasets from various biological contexts, pMTnet-omni characterized the longitudinal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of TCR-pMHC interactions and their functional impact. We successfully developed a biomarker based on pMTnet-omni for predicting immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in a cohort of 57 ICI-treated patients. pMTnet-omni represents a major advance towards developing a clinically usable AI system for TCR-pMHC pairing prediction that can aid the design and implementation of TCR-based immunotherapeutics.

Journal Title: Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 17
Abstract: The increasing breadth and depth of resolution in biological and clinical data, including -omics and real-world data, requires advanced analytical techniques like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to fully appreciate the impact of multi-dimensional population variability in intrinsic and extrinsic factors on disease progression and treatment outcomes. Integration of advanced data analytics in Quantitative Pharmacology is crucial for drug-disease knowledge management, enabling precise, efficient and inclusive drug development and utilization - an application we refer to as Model-Informed Precision Medicine. AI/ML enables characterization of the molecular and clinical sources of heterogeneity in disease trajectory, advancing endpoint qualification and biomarker discovery, and informing patient enrichment for Proof-of-Concept studies as well as trial designs for efficient evidence generation incorporating digital twins and virtual control arms. Explainable ML methods are valuable in elucidating predictors of efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments, thereby informing response monitoring and risk mitigation strategies. In oncology, emerging opportunities exist for development of the next generation of disease models via ML-assisted joint longitudinal modeling of high-dimensional biomarker data such as circulating tumor DNA and radiomics profiles as predictors of survival outcomes. Finally, mining real world data leveraging ML algorithms enables understanding of the impact of exclusion criteria on clinical outcomes, thereby informing rational design of appropriately inclusive clinical trials through data-driven broadening of eligibility criteria. Herein, we provide an overview of the aforementioned contexts of use of ML in drug-disease modeling based on examples across multiple therapeutic areas including neurology, rare diseases, autoimmune diseases, oncology and immuno-oncology.

Abstract: Adhesion is a critical quality attribute and performance characteristic for transdermal and topical delivery systems (TDS). Regulatory agencies recommend in vivo skin adhesion studies to support the approval of TDS in both new drug applications and abbreviated new drug applications. The current assessment approach in such studies is based on the visual observation of the percent adhesion, defined as the ratio of the area of TDS attached to the skin to the total area of the TDS. Visually estimated percent adhesion by trained clinicians or trial participants creates variability and bias. In addition, trial participants are typically confined to clinical centers during the entire product wear period, which may lead to challenges when translating adhesion performance to the real world setting. In this work we propose to use artificial intelligence and mobile technologies to aid and automate the collection of photographic evidence and estimation of percent adhesion. We trained state-of-art deep learning models with advanced techniques and in-house curated data. Results indicate good performance from the trained models and the potential use of such models in clinical practice is further explored.

Abstract: Establishing appropriate trust and maintaining a balanced reliance on digital resources are vital for accurate optical diagnoses and effective integration of computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) in colonoscopy. Active learning using diverse polyp image datasets can help in developing precise CADx systems. Enhancing doctors' digital literacy and interpreting their results is crucial. Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) addresses opacity, and textual descriptions, along with AI-generated content, deepen the interpretability of AI-based findings by doctors. AI conveying uncertainties and decision confidence aids doctors' acceptance of results. Optimal AI-doctor collaboration requires improving algorithm performance, transparency, addressing uncertainties, and enhancing doctors' optical diagnostic skills.
