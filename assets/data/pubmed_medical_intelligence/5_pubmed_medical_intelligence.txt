Author: ['Nicoara AI', 'Sas LM', 'Bita CE', 'Dinescu SC', 'Vreju FA']
Journal Title: Frontiers in medicine
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Early diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is essential to initiate timely interventions, such as medication and lifestyle changes, preventing irreversible joint damage, reducing symptoms, and improving long-term outcomes for patients. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist and hand, in case of RA and MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) in case of axSpA can identify inflammation before it is clinically discernible, this modality may be crucial for early diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, together with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have quickly evolved in the medical field, having an important role in improving diagnosis, prognosis, in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and monitoring the activity of rheumatic diseases through MRI. The improvements of AI techniques in the last years regarding imaging interpretation have demonstrated that a computer-based analysis can equal and even exceed the human eye. The studies in the field of AI have investigated how specific algorithms could distinguish between tissues, diagnose rheumatic pathology and grade different signs of early inflammation, all of them being crucial for tracking disease activity. The aim of this paper is to highlight the implementation of AI models in MRI with focus on diagnosis of RA and axSpA through a literature review.

Title: Joint deep autoencoder and subgraph augmentation for inferring microbial responses to drugs.
Author: ['Zhou Z', 'Zhuo L', 'Fu X', 'Zou Q']
Journal Title: Briefings in bioinformatics
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: Exploring microbial stress responses to drugs is crucial for the advancement of new therapeutic methods. While current artificial intelligence methodologies have expedited our understanding of potential microbial responses to drugs, the models are constrained by the imprecise representation of microbes and drugs. To this end, we combine deep autoencoder and subgraph augmentation technology for the first time to propose a model called JDASA-MRD, which can identify the potential indistinguishable responses of microbes to drugs. In the JDASA-MRD model, we begin by feeding the established similarity matrices of microbe and drug into the deep autoencoder, enabling to extract robust initial features of both microbes and drugs. Subsequently, we employ the MinHash and HyperLogLog algorithms to account intersections and cardinality data between microbe and drug subgraphs, thus deeply extracting the multi-hop neighborhood information of nodes. Finally, by integrating the initial node features with subgraph topological information, we leverage graph neural network technology to predict the microbes' responses to drugs, offering a more effective solution to the 'over-smoothing' challenge. Comparative analyses on multiple public datasets confirm that the JDASA-MRD model's performance surpasses that of current state-of-the-art models. This research aims to offer a more profound insight into the adaptability of microbes to drugs and to furnish pivotal guidance for drug treatment strategies.

Journal Title: Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: AIM: A high level of directly measured small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) is a strong risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A method for estimating sdLDL-C by using Sampson's equation that includes levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C and triglycerides (TG) has recently been proposed. We investigated the validation and exploration of estimated sdLDL-C level. METHODS: The associations between measured and estimated sdLDL-C levels were investigated in 605 Japanese subjects (men/women: 280/325; mean age: 65+/-15 years) who received annual health check-ups in the Tanno Sobetsu Study, a population-based cohort. RESULTS: Estimated sdLDL-C level was highly correlated with measured sdLDL-C level in all subjects (R(2) =0.701), nondiabetic subjects without any medication (n=254, R (2)=0.686) and subjects with diabetes mellitus (n=128, R(2)=0.721). Multivariable regression analysis showed that levels of non-HDL-C, TG and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGTP) were independent predictors of measured sdLDL-C level. In a stratification of the LDL window, all of the subjects with a combination of high non-HDL-C (>/= 170 mg/dL) and high TG (>/= 150 mg/dL) had high levels of measured and estimated sdLDL-C (>/= 35 mg/dL). Furthermore, machine learning-based estimation of sdLDL-C level by artificial intelligence software, Prediction One, was substantially improved by using components of Sampson's equation (R(2)=0.803) and by using those components with the addition of gammaGTP and deletion of TC (R(2)=0.929). CONCLUSIONS: sdLDL-C level estimated by Sampson's equation can be used instead of measured sdLDL-C level in general practice. By building multiple machine learning models of artificial intelligence, a more accurate and practical estimation of sdLDL-C level might be possible.

The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.2% in recognizing urinary tract activity, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the recognition technology. Furthermore, the motion analysis technology for preventing neurogenic bladder, which also employed CNN-based AI, showed promising results with an average accuracy of 83%. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a urination disease monitoring system aimed at predicting and managing risks for patients with urination issues. The system is designed to support the entire care cycle of a patient by leveraging AI technology that processes various image and signal data. We anticipate that this system will evolve into digital treatment products, ultimately providing therapeutic benefits to patients.

Journal Title: Computers in biology and medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: To improve the detection of COVID-19, this paper researches and proposes an effective swarm intelligence algorithm-driven multi-threshold image segmentation (MTIS) method. First, this paper proposes a novel RIME structure integrating the Co-adaptive hunting and dispersed foraging strategies, called CDRIME. Specifically, the Co-adaptive hunting strategy works in coordination with the basic search rules of RIME at the individual level, which not only facilitates the algorithm to explore the global optimal solution but also enriches the population diversity to a certain extent. The dispersed foraging strategy further enriches the population diversity to help the algorithm break the limitation of local search and thus obtain better convergence. Then, on this basis, a new multi-threshold image segmentation method is proposed by combining the 2D non-local histogram with 2D Kapur entropy, called CDRIME-MTIS. Finally, the results of experiments based on IEEE CEC2017, IEEE CEC2019, and IEEE CEC2022 demonstrate that CDRIME has superior performance than some other basic, advanced, and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of global search, convergence performance, and escape from local optimality. Meanwhile, the segmentation experiments on COVID-19 X-ray images demonstrate that CDRIME is more advantageous than RIME and other peers in terms of segmentation effect and adaptability to different threshold levels. In conclusion, the proposed CDRIME significantly enhances the global optimization performance and image segmentation of RIME and has great potential to improve COVID-19 diagnosis.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: AIMS: The increasing use of insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) produces a high rate of false positive (FP) diagnoses. Their verification results in a high workload for caregivers. We evaluated the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ILR-ECG Analyzer (ILR-ECG-A). This machine-learning algorithm reclassifies ICM-transmitted events to minimize the rate of FP diagnoses, while preserving device sensitivity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 546 recipients of ICM followed by the Implicity monitoring platform. To avoid clusterization, a single episode per ICM abnormal diagnosis (e.g. asystole, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia (AT)/atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia, artefact) was selected per patient, and analyzed by the ILR-ECG-A, applying the same diagnoses as the ICM. All episodes were reviewed by an adjudication committee (AC) and the results were compared. Among 879 episodes classified as abnormal by the ICM, 80 (9.1%) were adjudicated as 'Artefacts', 283 (32.2%) as FP, and 516 (58.7%) as 'abnormal' by the AC. The algorithm reclassified 215 of the 283 FP as normal (76.0%), and confirmed 509 of the 516 episodes as abnormal (98.6%). Seven undiagnosed false negatives were adjudicated as AT or non-specific abnormality. The overall diagnostic specificity was 76.0% and the sensitivity was 98.6%. CONCLUSION: The new AI-based ILR-ECG-A lowered the rate of FP ICM diagnoses significantly while retaining a > 98% sensitivity. This will likely alleviate considerably the clinical burden represented by the review of ICM events.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Based Diagnostic Support System for Functional Dyspepsia Based on Brain Activity and Food Preference.
Author: ['Katsumata R', 'Hosokawa T', 'Kamada T']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Background and aim Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are disorders where no organic clinical abnormalities are detected such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The brain activity of individuals with FD and IBS differs from that of healthy controls. Artificial intelligence can distinguish healthy controls from individuals with DGBI using several biomarkers. This study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support system using food preferences and brain activity in patients with DGBI. Methods ROME IV criteria were used to diagnose patients with FD and IBS. Their food preference was scored using a visual analog scale, and brain activity in the prefrontal cortex was investigated using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The diagnostic model was developed based on the brain activity and visual analog scale scores for food using an artificial neural network model. Results Forty-one participants, including 25 patients with DGBI were enrolled in the study. The accuracy of the artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using an artificial neural network in differentiating between healthy controls and patients with DGBI and between healthy controls and those with FD were 72.3% and 77.1%, respectively. Conclusions The artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using brain activity and preference to food images showed sufficiently high accuracy in distinguishing patients with DGBI from healthy controls, and those with FD from healthy controls. Therefore, the fNIRS system provides objective evidence for diagnosing DGBI.

Title: Asymptotic Properties of Neural Network Sieve Estimators.
Author: ['Shen X', 'Jiang C', 'Sakhanenko L', 'Lu Q']
Journal Title: Journal of nonparametric statistics
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Neural networks have become one of the most popularly used methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Due to the universal approximation theorem (Hornik et al., 1989), a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on compact support as long as the number of hidden units is sufficiently large. Statistically, a neural network can be classified into a nonlinear regression framework. However, if we consider it parametrically, due to the unidentifiability of the parameters, it is difficult to derive its asymptotic properties. Instead, we consider the estimation problem in a nonparametric regression framework and use the results from sieve estimation to establish the consistency, the rates of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the neural network estimators. We also illustrate the validity of the theories via simulations.

Author: ['Hoover B', 'Zaengle D', 'Mark-Moser M', 'Wingo P', 'Suhag A', 'Rose K']
Journal Title: Frontiers in big data
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Subsurface interpretations and models rely on knowledge from subject matter experts who utilize unstructured information from images, maps, cross sections, and other products to provide context to measured data (e. g., cores, well logs, seismic surveys). To enhance such knowledge discovery, we advanced the National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL) Subsurface Trend Analysis (STA) workflow with an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning approach for image embedding. NETL's STA method offers a validated science-based approach of combining geologic systems knowledge, statistical modeling, and datasets to improve predictions of subsurface properties. The STA image embedding tool quickly extracts images from unstructured knowledge products like publications, maps, websites, and presentations; categorically labels the images; and creates a repository for geologic domain postulation. Via a case study on geographic and subsurface literature of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), results show the STA image embedding tool extracts images and correctly labels them with ~90 to ~95% accuracy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Childhood cognitive abilities are a predictor of health outcomes and adult income potential. Identifying factors associated with childhood intelligence and their interactions is essential in behavioral research. We assessed the impact of genetic variants and early child stimulation (ECS) on child intelligence and examined their possible interaction as potential modifiers of IQ in a population-based longitudinal study. METHODS: Participants of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study (N = 4231) underwent intelligent quotient (IQ) by WISC-III assessment at 6 years of age. At 24 and 48-months, mothers answered five ECS marker questions, whose sum was used to create a score. The polygenic score for intelligence (IQ-PGS) was constructed from the GWAS-weighted estimate of cognition. Association was assessed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for maternal, family, and child confounding variables. To explore the possible influence of skin color and ethnoracial classification, the regression models were stratified according to the skin color variable, as a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, IQ-PGS (beta = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.26;1.31) as well as ECS (beta = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.76;2.92) were associated with IQ in this sample. The association between IQ-PGS and IQ was significant only in the white Brazilian group in the sensitivity analysis. However, there was no interaction between IQ-PGS and ECS on IQ (p((IQ-PGS x ECS)) = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: ECS did not modify the impact of genetic potential on intellectual development during childhood, suggesting that genetic factors and ECS exert independent effects on the IQ levels of children.

Abstract: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may progress to ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (iIBC), but often never will. Because DCIS is treated as early breast cancer, many women with harmless DCIS face overtreatment. To identify these women that may forego treatment, we hypothesized that DCIS morphometric features relate to the risk of subsequent iIBC. We developed an artificial intelligence-based DCIS morphometric analysis pipeline (AIDmap) to detect DCIS as a pathologist and measure morphological structures in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. These were from a case-control study of patients diagnosed with primary DCIS, treated by breast-conserving surgery without radiotherapy. We analyzed 689 WSIs of DCIS of which 226 were diagnosed with subsequent iIBC (cases) and 463 were not (controls). The distribution of 15 duct morphological measurements in each H&E was summarized in 55 morphometric variables. A ridge regression classifier with cross validation predicted 5-years-free of iIBC with an area-under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.76). A morphometric signature based on the 30 variables most associated with outcome, identified lesions containing small-sized ducts, low number of cells and low DCIS/stroma area ratio. This signature was associated with lower iIBC risk in a multivariate regression model including grade, ER, HER2 and COX-2 expression (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-0.78). AIDmap has potential to identify harmless DCIS that may not need treatment.

Abstract: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them, typically during periods of rest. The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS are incompletely understood. Here, we present a whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (n = 9,851) and controls (n = 38,957) in three population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE). Genome-wide association analysis identified nine independent risk loci, of which eight had been previously reported, and one was a novel risk locus (LMX1B, rs35196838, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-1.19, p-value = 2.2 x 10(-9)). A genome-wide, gene-based common variant analysis identified GLO1 as an additional risk gene (p-value = 8.45 x 10(-7)). Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study also identified GLO1 and a previously unreported gene, ELFN1. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (r(g) = 0.40, se = 0.08, p-value = 5.4 x 10(-7)), depression (r(g) = 0.35, se = 0.06, p-value = 2.17 x 10(-8)), and intelligence (r(g) = -0.20, se = 0.06, p-value = 4.0 x 10(-4)). Our study expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS and highlights the contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: The US drug labeling document contains essential information on drug efficacy and safety, making it a crucial regulatory resource for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug reviewers. Due to its extensive volume and the presence of free-text, conventional text mining analysis have encountered challenges in processing these data. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for natural language processing (NLP) have provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify key information from drug labeling, thereby enhancing safety reviews and support for regulatory decisions. We developed RxBERT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model pretrained on FDA human prescription drug labeling documents for an enhanced application of drug labeling documents in both research and drug review. RxBERT was derived from BioBERT with further training on human prescription drug labeling documents. RxBERT was demonstrated in several tasks using regulatory datasets, including those involved in the National Institutes of Technology Text Analysis Challenge Dataset (NIST TAC dataset), the FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Dataset (ADE Eval dataset), and the classification of texts from submission packages into labeling sections (US Drug Labeling dataset). For all these tasks, RxBERT reached 86.5 F1-scores in both TAC and ADE Eval classification, respectively, and prediction accuracy of 87% for the US Drug Labeling dataset. Overall, RxBERT was shown to be as competitive or have better performance compared to other NLP approaches such as BERT, BioBERT, etc. In summary, we developed RxBERT, a transformer-based model specific for drug labeling that outperformed the original BERT model. RxBERT has the potential to be used to assist research scientists and FDA reviewers to better process and utilize drug labeling information toward the advancement of drug effectiveness and safety for public health. This proof-of-concept study also demonstrated a potential pathway to customized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the sensitive regulatory documents for internal application.

Abstract: Purpose To evaluate the performance of a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool by comparing the quantified stenosis severity at coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with a reference standard derived from invasive quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Materials and Methods This secondary, post hoc analysis included 120 participants (mean age, 59.7 years +/- 10.8 [SD]; 73 [60.8%] men, 47 [39.2%] women) from three large clinical trials (AFFECTS, P3, REFINE) who underwent CCTA and invasive coronary angiography with QCA. Quantitative analysis of coronary stenosis severity at CCTA was performed using an AI-based coronary stenosis quantification (AI-CSQ) software service. Blinded comparison between QCA and AI-CSQ was measured on a per-vessel and per-patient basis. Results The per-vessel AI-CSQ diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80%, 88%, 86%, 65%, and 94%, respectively, for diameter stenosis (DS) 50% or greater; and 78%, 92%, 91%, 47%, and 98%, respectively, for DS 70% or greater. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or greater on a per-vessel basis were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.95; P < .001) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.97; P < .001), respectively. The AUCs to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or greater on a per-patient basis were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.97; P < .001) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; P < .001), respectively. Conclusion AI-CSQ at CCTA demonstrated a high diagnostic performance compared with QCA both on a per-patient and per-vessel basis, with high sensitivity for stenosis detection.

Abstract: Medical education assessment faces multifaceted challenges, including data complexity, resource constraints, bias, feedback translation, and educational continuity. Traditional approaches often fail to adequately address these issues, creating stressful and inequitable learning environments. This article introduces the concept of precision education, a data-driven paradigm aimed at personalizing the educational experience for each learner. It explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its subsets Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), can augment this model to tackle the inherent limitations of traditional assessment methods.AI can enable proactive data collection, offering consistent and objective assessments while reducing resource burdens. It has the potential to revolutionize not only competency assessment but also participatory interventions, such as personalized coaching and predictive analytics for at-risk trainees. The article also discusses key challenges and ethical considerations in integrating AI into medical education, such as algorithmic transparency, data privacy, and the potential for bias propagation.AI's capacity to process large datasets and identify patterns allows for a more nuanced, individualized approach to medical education. It offers promising avenues to not only improve the efficiency of educational assessments but also to make them more equitable. However, the ethical and technical challenges must be diligently addressed. The article concludes that embracing AI in medical education assessment is a strategic move toward creating a more personalized, effective, and fair educational landscape. This necessitates collaborative, multidisciplinary research and ethical vigilance to ensure that the technology serves educational goals while upholding social justice and ethical integrity.
