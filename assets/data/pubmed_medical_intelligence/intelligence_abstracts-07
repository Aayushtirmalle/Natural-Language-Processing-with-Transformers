The study developed a framework to investigate the impact of multiple spatial 
and temporal resolutions on urban growth simulation. The research utilized the 
convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model and three regular models 
and data from 2009 to 2017 to simulate the urban area of Liangjiang New District 
in 2018 and determine the optimal spatiotemporal resolution for urban expansion 
models. The results indicated that the ConvLSTM model has the best simulation 
result and the ideal temporal resolution for Liangjiang district is to include 
the previous two years of data, with an optimal spatial resolution of 90 m and a 
spatiotemporal simulation zone within a two-year time step and 100 × 100 spatial 
information filter. At this combination, the kappa value of the ConvLSTM is 0.87 
which is about 5% higher than others. Our findings revealed that the 
characteristics of input data can have a significant impact on simulation 
results and should be carefully considered during the simulation process.

A quarter of children with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) have a comorbid 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which impacts the testing of 
intelligence. ADHD is therefore treated before proceeding with the assessment of 
intelligence. It is expected that the treatment of ADHD will mitigate its 
effects on intelligence testing. Though this is frequently done in clinical 
practice, we could not find any study comparing IQ profiles of children having 
SLD with and without ADHD after treating ADHD to look for any changes between 
them. Therefore, we planned this study to compare the cognitive profiles of 
children having SLD with and without ADHD and describe any difference in their 
profiles. It was a retrospective cross-sectional study. We compared 695 children 
having SLD with treated ADHD to 721 children having SLD without ADHD on their 
WISC III profiles. We found that children having SLD with treated ADHD scored 
significantly lower on Digit Span and Coding. We suggest routine use of 
Cognitive Working Memory Training, peer tutoring, and task modifications in 
children having SLD with ADHD along with medicines and remedial education for 
better outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Investigating the core component of social cognition, known as the 
theory of mind (ToM), becomes imperative in patients with moderate-to-severe 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) as they may present with social cognitive 
deficit-related disability interfering with patients' functional and behavioral 
status.
AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the neurocognitive and behavioral 
predictors of the ToM in patients with traumatic brain injury (PtTBI).
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Thirty PtTBI and 30 healthy controls (HCs) were assessed on 
a set of tasks.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: The assessment included ToM tasks (cognitive and 
affective, verbal and nonverbal, and first-order and second-order) along with 
various neuropsychological (NP) assessments to explore their memory, executive 
functioning, and intelligence. Further, TBI participants also underwent 
behavioral and functional outcome measures using the Functional Status 
Examination (FSE) and the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive 
statistics and regression analyses.
RESULTS: Findings confirmed ToM deficit across all modes of ToM tasks in PtTBI 
and implicated the role of executive function and working memory in the 
expression of ToM in this group. While cognitive faux pas (FPC) and first-order 
false belief together could explain poor performance on NBRS, the nonverbal ToM 
task predicts functional outcome in PtTBI.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have practical implications as they promote 
cognitive remediation intervention focused on restoring ToM, which may improve 
functional limitations and resulting disability in PtTBI.

Medical advancements in the diagnosis, surgical techniques, perioperative care, 
and continued care throughout childhood have transformed the outlook for 
individuals with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), improving survival and shifting the 
perspective towards lifelong care. However, with a growing population of 
survivors, longstanding challenges have been accentuated, and new challenges 
have surfaced, necessitating a re-evaluation of TOF care. Availability of 
prenatal diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging 
techniques, previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding 
optimal timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. 
To address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and 
machine learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize 
patient management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with 
TOF. Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning 
have spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and 
diagnosis, automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk 
stratification, and planning and performing cardiac interventions. By embracing 
these advancements and incorporating them into routine clinical practice, 
personalized medicine could be delivered, leading to the best possible outcomes 
for patients. In this review, we provide an overview of these evolving 
applications and emphasize the challenges, limitations, and future potential for 
integrating them into clinical care.

Publisher: De grandes avancées médicales touchant le diagnostic de la tétralogie 
de Fallot (TF), les techniques chirurgicales, les soins périopératoires ainsi 
que les soins continus au cours de l’enfance ont transformé le pronostic de 
cette maladie et prolongé la survie des patients, d’où la nécessité d’adopter 
une approche thérapeutique à long terme. Compte tenu du nombre croissant de 
survivants, certains défis prennent une plus grande ampleur et de nouvelles 
difficultés s’y ajoutent. Il convient donc de réévaluer les soins pour les 
patients atteints de TF. L’accès limité au diagnostic prénatal, les informations 
fragmentaires obtenues avec les techniques d’imagerie traditionnelles, les 
complications médicales inattendues et les débats sur les indications et le 
moment approprié pour les interventions chirurgicales subséquentes sont de 
nouveaux enjeux. Pour y faire face, l’intégration des outils d’intelligence 
artificielle (IA) et d’apprentissage automatique (AA) est prometteuse et 
pourrait réinventer la prise en charge des patients atteints de TF en plus 
d’améliorer leurs résultats à long terme. L’utilisation innovante de l’IA et de 
l’AA touche de nombreux aspects des soins offerts à ces patients, par exemple le 
dépistage et le diagnostic, l’analyse et l’interprétation automatiques d’images, 
la stratification du risque clinique de même que la planification et la 
réalisation d’interventions cardiaques. L’adoption de ces avancées 
technologiques et leur intégration dans la pratique clinique courante ouvrent la 
voie à une approche de médecine personnalisée dans l’espoir d’obtenir les 
meilleurs résultats possibles pour les patients. Notre article de synthèse 
présente ces applications en pleine évolution et met en évidence leurs 
perspectives d’intégration aux soins cliniques, mais aussi les défis et les 
limites qui accompagnent cette approche.

Liability for harm caused by AI in healthcare: an overview of the core legal 
concepts.

Bottomley D(1), Thaldar D(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Law, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare in Africa 
presents transformative opportunities but also raises profound legal challenges, 
especially concerning liability. As AI becomes more autonomous, determining who 
or what is responsible when things go wrong becomes ambiguous. This article aims 
to review the legal concepts relevant to the issue of liability for harm caused 
by AI in healthcare. While some suggest attributing legal personhood to AI as a 
potential solution, the feasibility of this remains controversial. The 
principal-agent relationship, where the physician is held responsible for AI 
decisions, risks reducing the adoption of AI tools due to potential liabilities. 
Similarly, using product law to establish liability is problematic because of 
the dynamic learning nature of AI, which deviates from static products. This 
fluidity complicates traditional definitions of product defects and, by 
extension, where responsibility lies. Exploring alternatives, risk-based 
determinations of liability, which focus on potential hazards rather than on 
specific fault assignments, emerges as a potential pathway. However, these, too, 
present challenges in assigning accountability. Strict liability has been 
proposed as another avenue. It can simplify the compensation process for victims 
by focusing on the harm rather than on the fault. Yet, concerns arise over the 
economic impact on stakeholders, the potential for unjust reputational damage, 
and the feasibility of a global application. Instead of approaches based on 
liability, reconciliation holds much promise to facilitate regulatory sandboxes. 
In conclusion, while the integration of AI systems into healthcare holds vast 
potential, it necessitates a re-evaluation of our legal frameworks. The central 
challenge is how to adapt traditional concepts of liability to the novel and 
unpredictable nature of AI-or to move away from liability towards 
reconciliation. Future discussions and research must navigate these complex 
waters and seek solutions that ensure both progress and protection.

OBJECTIVES: Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a potentially devastating 
complication of neurologic injury. Developing an ICP prediction algorithm to 
help the clinician adjust treatments and potentially prevent elevated ICP 
episodes.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Three hundred thirty-five ICUs at 208 hospitals in the United States.
SUBJECTS: Adults patients from the electronic ICU (eICU) Collaborative Research 
Database was used to train an ensemble machine learning model to predict the ICP 
30 minutes in the future. Predictive performance was evaluated using a left-out 
test dataset and externally evaluated on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) Matched Waveform Database.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Predictors included age, assigned sex, 
laboratories, medications and infusions, input/output, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
components, and time-series vitals (heart rate, ICP, mean arterial pressure, 
respiratory rate, and temperature). Each patient ICU stay was divided into 
successive 95-minute timeblocks. For each timeblock, the model was trained on 
nontime-varying covariates as well as on 12 observations of time-varying 
covariates at 5-minute intervals and asked to predict the 5-minute median ICP 30 
minutes after the last observed ICP value. Data from 931 patients with ICP 
monitoring in the eICU dataset were extracted (46,207 timeblocks). The root mean 
squared error was 4.51 mm Hg in the eICU test set and 3.56 mm Hg in the 
MIMIC-III dataset. The most important variables driving ICP prediction were 
previous ICP history, patients' temperature, weight, serum creatinine, age, GCS, 
and hemodynamic parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: IntraCranial pressure prediction AlgoRithm using machinE learning, 
an ensemble machine learning model, trained to predict the ICP of a patient 30 
minutes in the future based on baseline characteristics and vitals data from the 
past hour showed promising predictive performance including in an external 
validation dataset.

Artificial intelligence (AI) describes the application of computer algorithms to 
the solution of problems that have traditionally required human intelligence. 
Although formal work in AI has been slowly advancing for almost 70 years, 
developments in the last decade, and particularly in the last year, have led to 
an explosion of AI applications in multiple fields. Neuro-oncology has not 
escaped this trend. Given the expected integration of AI-based methods to 
neuro-oncology practice over the coming years, we set to provide an overview of 
existing technologies as they are applied to the neuropathology and 
neuroradiology of brain tumors. We highlight current benefits and limitations of 
these technologies and offer recommendations on how to appraise novel AI-tools 
as they undergo consideration for integration into clinical workflows.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into 
regenerative orthopedics heralds a paradigm shift in clinical methodologies and 
patient management. This review article scrutinizes AI's role in augmenting 
diagnostic accuracy, refining predictive models, and customizing patient care in 
orthopedic medicine. Focusing on innovations such as KeyGene and CellNet, we 
illustrate AI's adeptness in navigating complex genomic datasets, cellular 
differentiation, and scaffold biodegradation, which are critical components of 
tissue engineering. Despite its transformative potential, AI's clinical adoption 
remains in its infancy, contending with challenges in validation, ethical 
oversight, and model training for clinical relevance. This review posits AI as a 
vital complement to human intelligence (HI), advocating for an interdisciplinary 
approach that merges AI's computational prowess with medical expertise to 
fulfill precision medicine's promise. By analyzing historical and contemporary 
developments in AI, from the foundational theories of McCullough and Pitts to 
sophisticated neural networks, the paper emphasizes the need for a synergistic 
alliance between AI and HI. This collaboration is imperative for improving 
surgical outcomes, streamlining therapeutic modalities, and enhancing the 
quality of patient care. Our article calls for robust interdisciplinary 
strategies to overcome current obstacles and harness AI's full potential in 
revolutionizing patient outcomes, thereby significantly contributing to the 
advancement of regenerative orthopedics and the broader field of scientific 
research.

Background This study aims to explore the factors associated with artificial 
intelligence (AI) and patient autonomy in obesity treatment decision-making. 
Methodology A cross-sectional, online, descriptive survey design was adopted in 
this study. The survey instrument incorporated the Ideal Patient Autonomy Scale 
(IPAS) and other factors affecting patient autonomy in the AI-patient 
relationship. The study participants included 74 physicians, 55 dieticians, and 
273 obese patients. Results Different views were expressed in the scales AI 
knows the best (μ = 2.95-3.15) and the patient should decide (μ = 2.95-3.16). 
Ethical concerns (μ = 3.24) and perceived privacy risks (μ = 3.58) were 
identified as having a more negative influence on patient autonomy compared to 
personal innovativeness (μ = 2.41) and trust (μ = 2.85). Physicians and 
dieticians expressed significantly higher trust in AI compared to patients (p < 
0.05). Conclusions Patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship is 
significantly affected by privacy, trust, and ethical issues. As trust is a 
multifaceted factor and AI is a novel technology in healthcare, it is essential 
to fully explore the various factors influencing trust and patient autonomy.

Medical education has ventured into a new arena of computer-assisted teaching 
powered by artificial intelligence (AI). In medical institutions, AI can serve 
as an intelligent tool facilitating the decision-making process effectively. AI 
can enhance teaching by assisting in developing new strategies for educators. 
Similarly, students also benefit from intelligent systems playing the role of 
competent teachers. Thus, AI-integrated medical education paves new 
opportunities for advanced teaching and learning experiences and improved 
outcomes. On the other hand, optical mark recognition and automated scoring are 
ways AI can also transform into a real-time assessor and evaluator in medical 
education. This review summarizes the AI tools and their application in medical 
teaching or learning, assessment, and administrative support. This article can 
aid medical institutes in planning and implementing AI according to the needs of 
the educators.

AIM AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to analyze the various influencing 
factors affecting the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled virtual 
assistants (VAs) for self-management of leukemia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design is adopted in this study. The 
questionnaire included eight factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, trust, 
perceived privacy risk, and personal innovativeness) affecting the acceptance of 
AI-enabled virtual assistants. A total of 397 leukemia patients participated in 
the online survey.
RESULTS: Performance expectancy (μ = 3.14), effort expectancy (μ = 3.05), and 
personal innovativeness (μ = 3.14) were identified to be the major influencing 
factors of AI adoption. Statistically significant differences (p < .05) were 
observed between the gender-based and age groups of the participants in relation 
to the various factors. In addition, perceived privacy risks were negatively 
correlated with all other factors.
CONCLUSION: Although there are negative factors such as privacy risks and 
ethical issues in AI adoption, perceived effectiveness and ease of use among 
individuals are leading to greater adoption of AI-enabled VAs.

Prior authorization is a cumbersome process that requires clinicians to create 
an individualized letter that includes detailed information about the patient's 
medical condition, proposed treatment plan, and any supplemental information 
required to obtain approval from a patient's insurance company before any 
services or procedures may be provided to the patient. However, drafting 
authorization letters is time-consuming clerical work that not only places an 
increased administrative burden on orthopedic surgeons and office staff but also 
concurrently takes time away from patient care. Therefore, there is a need to 
improve this process by streamlining workflows for healthcare providers in order 
to prioritize direct patient care. In this report, we present a case utilizing 
OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, L.L.C., San Francisco, CA, USA) to draft a prior 
authorization request letter for the use of matrix-induced autologous 
chondrocyte implantation to treat a cartilage injury of the knee.

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a gradually maturing medical imaging 
technique that relies on computational algorithms for reconstructing and 
visualizing internal conductivity distributions within the human body. To 
provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the current state and 
trends in the EIT algorithm research, we conducted bibliometric analysis on a 
25-year EIT algorithm research dataset sourced from Web of Science Core 
Collections. We visualized publication characteristics, collaboration patterns, 
keywords, and co-cited references. The results indicate a steady increase in 
annual publications over recent decades. The United States, United Kingdom, 
China, and South Korea contributed 60% of the articles collaboratively. Keyword 
analysis unveiled three distinct stages in the evolution of EIT algorithm 
research: the establishment of fundamental algorithm frameworks, optimization 
for improved imaging performance, and the development of algorithms for clinical 
applications. Additionally, there has been a shift in research focus from 
traditional theories to the incorporation of new methods, such as artificial 
intelligence. Co-cited references suggest that integrating EIT with other 
established imaging techniques may emerge as a new trend in EIT algorithm 
research. In summary, EIT algorithms have been a consistent research focus, with 
current efforts centered on optimizing algorithms to enhance imaging 
performance. The emerging research trend involves utilizing more diverse and 
intersecting algorithms.

The medical profession has experienced a significant increase in the number of 
women practitioners in recent decades, leading to a reduction in the gender gap. 
According to the United States Medical Association, approximately 25% of 
physicians in the United States are now women. Although this progress is evident 
in the clinical setting, women's representation in academic medicine remains 
disproportionately low. The underrepresentation of women in academia has various 
consequences, including limited access to academic resources and hindered career 
growth. Previous studies have attempted to analyze these disparities, but 
results have been inconsistent, and the issue's complexity has not been fully 
understood. This study aims to examine the disparity in the gender of first 
authors in academic publications related to " Artificial intelligence (AI) and 
Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD)" between 2010 and 2023. Analysis 
was conducted on June 21st, 2023, using the database PubMed. The search term 
"AI" AND "ADHD" was used to derive all articles over a period of 13 years, from 
January 1st, 2010, to December 31st, 2022, excluding the year 2023 due to 
limited available publications. The relevant articles were downloaded in 
Microsoft Excel sheets. The gender of the first authors was determined using the 
NamSor app V.2, an application programming interface (API) with a large dataset 
of names and countries of origin. A total of 204 articles were considered for 
this study. There were 78 female first authors and 126 male first authors. The 
highest number of publications with a male first author occurred in 2022, with 
32 publications. The Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, and China have the highest 
gender ratios, indicating a more favourable representation of both genders. The 
p-value of 0.2664 suggests that there is no significant association between 
gender and country. The findings revealed a gender disparity, with a higher 
number of male first authors. By addressing and rectifying these disparities, we 
can enhance the overall quality, diversity, and inclusivity of research in the 
field of ADHD and Artificial Intelligence.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) technology to 
explore for automated medical record quality control methods, standardize the 
process for medical record documentation, and deal with the drawbacks of 
manually implemented quality control.
METHODS: In this study, we constructed a medical record quality control system 
based on AI. We first designed and built, for the system, a quality control rule 
base based on authoritative standards and expert opinions. Then, medical records 
data were automatically collected through a data acquisition engine and were 
converted into structured data through a post-structured engine. Finally, the 
medical record quality control engine was combined with the rule base to analyze 
the data, identify quality problems, and realize automated intelligent quality 
control. This system was applied to the quality control of medical records and 
five quality control points were selected, including similarities in the history 
of the present illness, defects in the description of chief complaints, 
incomplete initial diagnosis, missing in formation in the history of 
menstruation, marriage, and childbirth, and mismatch between the chief 
complaints and the history of the present illness. We randomly selected 2 918 
medical records of patients discharged in January 2022 to conduct AI quality 
control. Then we organized medical record quality control experts to conduct an 
accuracy review, made a comparison with previous manual quality control records, 
and analyzed the results. The number of quality problems that were verified in 
the accuracy review was taken as the gold standard and receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for the 5 quality control points.
RESULTS: According to the accuracy review performed by medical record quality 
control experts, the accuracy of AI quality control reached 89.57%. For the 
sampled medical records, the results of AI quality control were compared with 
those of previous manually performed quality control and only one problem 
detected by manual quality control of the sampled medical records was not 
detected by the AI quality control system. The number of medical record quality 
problems correctly detected by AI quality control was about 2.97 times that of 
manual quality control. Analysis of the ROC curves showed that the AUC of the 
five quality control points of the AI quality control system were statistically 
significant (P<0.05) and all the AUC values approximated or exceeded 0.9. In 
contrast, results obtained through manually performed quality control found 
significant AUC (0.797) for only one quality control point-similarities in the 
history of present illness (P<0.05). Comparison of the AUC values of the two 
quality control methods showed that AI quality control system had an advantage 
over manually performed quality control for the five quality control points.
CONCLUSION: Through the application of medical record quality control system 
based on AI, efficient full quality control of medical record documentation can 
be achieved and the detection rate of quality problems can be effectively 
improved. In addition, the system helps save manpower and improve the quality of 
medical record documentation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clinical trials for reducing fibrosis in steatotic liver 
disease (SLD) have targeted macrophages with variable results. We evaluated 
intrahepatic macrophages in patients with SLD to determine if activity scores or 
fibrosis stages influenced phenotypes and expression of druggable targets, such 
as CCR2 and galectin-3.
METHODS: Liver biopsies from controls or patients with minimal or advanced 
fibrosis were subject to gene expression analysis using nCounter to determine 
differences in macrophage-related genes (n = 30). To investigate variability 
among individual patients, we compared additional biopsies by staining them with 
multiplex antibody panels (CD68/CD14/CD16/CD163/Mac387 or 
CD163/CCR2/galectin-3/Mac387) followed by spectral imaging and spatial analysis. 
Algorithms that utilize deep learning/artificial intelligence were applied to 
create cell cluster plots, phenotype profile maps, and to determine levels of 
protein expression (n = 34).
RESULTS: Several genes known to be pro-fibrotic (e.g. CD206, TREM2, CD163, and 
ARG1) showed either no significant differences or significantly decreased with 
advanced fibrosis. Although marked variability in gene expression was observed 
in individual patients with cirrhosis, several druggable targets and their 
ligands (e.g. CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5, and LGALS3) were significantly increased 
when compared to patients with minimal fibrosis. Antibody panels identified 
populations that were significantly increased (e.g. Mac387+), decreased (e.g. 
CD14+), or enriched (e.g. interactions of Mac387) in patients that had 
progression of disease or advanced fibrosis. Despite heterogeneity in patients 
with SLD, several macrophage phenotypes and druggable targets showed a positive 
correlation with increasing NAFLD activity scores and fibrosis stages.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLD have markedly varied macrophage- and druggable 
target-related gene and protein expression in their livers. Several patients had 
relatively high expression, while others were like controls. Overall, patients 
with more advanced disease had significantly higher expression of CCR2 and 
galectin-3 at both the gene and protein levels.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Appreciating individual differences within the hepatic 
microenvironment of patients with SLD may be paramount to developing effective 
treatments. These results may explain why such a small percentage of patients 
have responded to macrophage-targeting therapies and provide additional support 
for precision medicine-guided treatment of chronic liver diseases.

Embedding a multiple health condition approach across NHS Greater Manchester.

Lake C(1), Mishra A(1), Conroy M(1).

Author information:
(1)NHS Greater Manchester, Manchester, UK.

Here, we present two real-world examples of how a prioritised, person-centred, 
multiple health condition approach - also termed a multimorbidity approach - has 
been applied to long-term condition management in general practice in Greater 
Manchester. The first example is the implementation of targeted multiple health 
condition reviews via a population health management approach across general 
practice in the City of Manchester. The second example is the development of a 
person-centred risk stratification tool, focused on unmet cardiovascular need, 
called 'CVNeed'. This tool provides a unique approach to highlighting the 
highest unmet need and, thus, the largest return on investment to the system 
from proactive efforts. These examples demonstrate how a person-centred, 
multiple health condition approach to long-term condition management, enabled by 
data intelligence to drive prioritisation of clinical need, can help to address 
longstanding health inequalities and unwarranted variation in health outcomes. 
This work also highlights the potential for integrated care systems (ICS) to 
work collaboratively to tackle health inequalities at a system, locality and 
neighbourhood level, thus making significant strides toward achieving the vision 
set out in the Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) Strategy.

Artificial intelligence (AI) may have a profound impact on traditional teaching 
in academic settings. Multiple concerns have been raised, especially related to 
using ChatGPT for creating de novo essays. However, AI programs such as ChatGPT 
may augment teaching techniques. In this article, we used ChatGPT 3.5 to create 
60 multiple choice questions. Author written text was uploaded and ChatGPT asked 
to create multiple choice questions with an explanation for the correct answer 
and explanations for the incorrect answers. Unfortunately, ChatGPT only 
generated correct questions and answers with explanations in 32 % of the 
questions (19 out of 60). In many instances, ChatGPT failed to provide an 
explanation for the incorrect answers. An additional 25 % of the questions had 
answers that were either wrong or misleading. A grade of 32 % would be 
considered failing in most courses. Despite these issues, instructors may still 
find ChatGPT useful for creating practice exams with explanations-with the 
caveat that extensive editing may be required.

Three successive multiple generations of rats were exposed to different 
toxicants and then bred to the transgenerational F5 generation to assess the 
impacts of multiple generation different exposures. The current study examines 
the actions of the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on the F0 generation, 
followed by jet fuel hydrocarbon mixture exposure of the F1 generation, and then 
pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane on the F2 generation gestating 
females. The subsequent F3 and F4 generations and F5 transgenerational 
generation were obtained and F1-F5 generations examined for male sperm 
epigenetic alterations and pathology in males and females. Significant impacts 
on the male sperm differential DNA methylation regions were observed. The F3-F5 
generations were similar in ∼50% of the DNA methylation regions. The pathology 
of each generation was assessed in the testis, ovary, kidney, and prostate, as 
well as the presence of obesity and tumors. The pathology used a newly developed 
Deep Learning, artificial intelligence-based histopathology analysis. 
Observations demonstrated compounded disease impacts in obesity and metabolic 
parameters, but other pathologies plateaued with smaller increases at the F5 
transgenerational generation. Observations demonstrate that multiple 
generational exposures, which occur in human populations, appear to increase 
epigenetic impacts and disease susceptibility.

Medicine Busan Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to assess the diagnostic potential of deep 
convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting Helicobacter pylori 
infection in patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and 
Campylobacter-like organism tests.
METHODS: We categorized a total of 13,071 images of various gastric sub-areas 
and employed five pretrained DCNN architectures: ResNet-101, Xception, 
Inception-v3, InceptionResnet-v2, and DenseNet-201. Additionally, we created an 
ensemble model by combining the output probabilities of the best models. We used 
images of different sub-areas of the stomach for training and evaluated the 
performance of our models. The diagnostic metrics assessed included area under 
the curve (AUC), specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative 
predictive value.
RESULTS: When training included images from all sub-areas of the stomach, our 
ensemble model demonstrated the highest AUC (0.867), with specificity at 78.44%, 
accuracy at 80.28%, positive predictive value at 82.66%, and negative predictive 
value at 77.37%. Significant differences were observed in AUC between the 
ensemble model and the individual DCNN models. When training utilized images 
from each sub-area separately, the AUC values for the antrum, cardia and fundus, 
lower body greater curvature and lesser curvature, and upper body greater 
curvature and lesser curvature regions were 0.842, 0.826, 0.718, and 0.858, 
respectively, when the ensemble model was used.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the DCNN model, designed for automated 
image analysis, holds promise for the evaluation and diagnosis of Helicobacter 
pylori infection.

This paper discusses some overlooked challenges faced when working with machine 
learning models for histopathology and presents a novel opportunity to support 
"Learning Health Systems" with them. Initially, the authors elaborate on these 
challenges after separating them according to their mitigation strategies: those 
that need innovative approaches, time, or future technological capabilities and 
those that require a conceptual reappraisal from a critical perspective. Then, a 
novel opportunity to support "Learning Health Systems" by integrating hidden 
information extracted by ML models from digitalized histopathology slides with 
other healthcare big data is presented.

AI has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. Noteworthy advances 
in AI algorithms and large language models (LLM) have led to the development of 
natural generative language (NGL) systems such as ChatGPT. Although these LLM 
can simulate human conversations and generate content in real time, they face 
challenges related to the topicality and accuracy of the information they 
generate. This study aimed to assess whether ChatGPT-4 could provide accurate 
and reliable answers to general dentists in the field of oral surgery, and thus 
explore its potential as an intelligent virtual assistant in clinical decision 
making in oral surgery. Thirty questions related to oral surgery were posed to 
ChatGPT4, each question repeated 30 times. Subsequently, a total of 900 
responses were obtained. Two surgeons graded the answers according to the 
guidelines of the Spanish Society of Oral Surgery, using a three-point Likert 
scale (correct, partially correct/incomplete, and incorrect). Disagreements were 
arbitrated by an experienced oral surgeon, who provided the final grade Accuracy 
was found to be 71.7%, and consistency of the experts' grading across 
iterations, ranged from moderate to almost perfect. ChatGPT-4, with its 
potential capabilities, will inevitably be integrated into dental disciplines, 
including oral surgery. In the future, it could be considered as an auxiliary 
intelligent virtual assistant, though it would never replace oral surgery 
experts. Proper training and verified information by experts will remain vital 
to the implementation of the technology. More comprehensive research is needed 
to ensure the safe and successful application of AI in oral surgery.

language learning on Chinese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students' 
writing skills and writing motivation. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes 
more prevalent in educational settings, understanding its effects on language 
learning outcomes is crucial.
METHODS: The study employs a comprehensive approach, combining quantitative and 
qualitative methods. The quantitative phase utilizes a pre-test and post-test 
design to assess writing skills. Fifty EFL students, matched for proficiency, 
are randomly assigned to experimental (AI-assisted instruction via ChatGPT) or 
control (traditional instruction) groups. Writing samples are evaluated using 
established scoring rubrics. Concurrently, semi-structured interviews are 
conducted with a subset of participants to explore writing motivation and 
experiences with AI-assisted learning.
RESULTS: Quantitative analysis reveals significant improvements in both writing 
skills and motivation among students who received AI-assisted instruction 
compared to the control group. The experimental group demonstrates enhanced 
proficiency in various aspects of writing, including organization, coherence, 
grammar, and vocabulary. Qualitative findings showcase diverse perspectives, 
ranging from recognition of AI's innovative instructional role and its positive 
influence on writing skills and motivation to concerns about contextual accuracy 
and over-reliance. Participants also reflect on the long-term impact and 
sustainability of AI-assisted instruction, emphasizing the need for ongoing 
development and adaptation of AI tools.
DISCUSSION: The nuanced findings offer a comprehensive understanding of AI's 
transformative potential in education. These insights have practical 
implications for practitioners and researchers, emphasizing the benefits, 
challenges, and the evolving nature of AI's role in language instruction.

INTRODUCTION: Artificial Intelligence tools are being introduced in almost every 
field of human life, including medical sciences and medical education, among 
scepticism and enthusiasm.
RESEARCH QUESTION: to assess how a generative language tool (Generative 
Pretrained Transformer 3.5, ChatGPT) performs at both generating questions and 
answering a neurosurgical residents' written exam. Namely, to assess how ChatGPT 
generates questions, how it answers human-generated questions, how residents 
answer AI-generated questions and how AI answers its self-generated question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 questions were included in the written exam, 46 
questions were generated by humans (senior staff members) and 4 were generated 
by ChatGPT. 11 participants took the exam (ChatGPT and 10 residents). Questions 
were both open-ended and multiple-choice.8 questions were not submitted to 
ChatGPT since they contained images or schematic drawings to interpret.
RESULTS: formulating requests to ChatGPT required an iterative process to 
precise both questions and answers. Chat GPT scored among the lowest ranks 
(9/11) among all the participants). There was no difference in response rate for 
residents' between human-generated vs AI-generated questions that could have 
been attributed to less clarity of the question. ChatGPT answered correctly to 
all its self-generated questions.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: AI is a promising and powerful tool for medical 
education and for specific medical purposes, which need to be further 
determined. To request AI to generate logical and sound questions, that request 
must be formulated as precise as possible, framing the content, the type of 
question and its correct answers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate cognitive functioning in patients with higher 
education having post COVID-19 condition.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=38; mean age, 48.5y; 71% women) at the Cognitive Post 
COVID-19 Clinic at Danderyd University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, who sought 
health care because of self-experienced cognitive problems. All had at least 4 
years of university education and an initially mild infection (ie, most were not 
hospital admitted, none were admitted to intensive care).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive test performance assessed with a comprehensive 
neuropsychological test battery including Information, Matrix Reasoning, Coding, 
and Digit Span from Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, Buschke Selective 
Reminding Test, Rey Complex Figure Test, Ruff 2&7, Color-Word Interference Test, 
Verbal Fluency, and Trail Making Test. The mean time between the infection and 
the assessment was 18 months.
RESULTS: Cognitive deficits were evident on tests of verbal learning and memory 
(Buschke Selective Reminding Test) and selective attention (Ruff 2&7). 
Approximately 50% of the participants had scores lower than 1 SD below the mean 
in the norm group on the measures of verbal learning and memory. When estimated 
premorbid cognitive functioning was accounted for, deficits were suggested in 
most cognitive domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Post COVID-19 condition seems to be associated with cognitive 
deficits, even in patients with high education and an initially mild infection.

Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of dementia, which is 
associated with the progressive deterioration of the intelligence and senses. 
Free radicals are created during oxidative stress in cells, which are considered 
one of the destructive factors in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the 
antifibrillar and antioxidant properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 
NPs) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. The CeO2 NPs were 
synthesized and analyzed to reveal the physicochemical and biological 
properties. The results showed that the CeO2 NPs have unique properties with 
potent antioxidant activities. The experimental and computational studies showed 
that the CeO2 NPs interact with the active site of Alpha-synuclein. The 
existence of hydrogen bonding between O atoms of CeO2 NPs and N-H of adjacent 
acid amines and the equilibrium distances were confirmed by 1.751 (Leu100), 
1.786 (Gln99) and 2.213 Å (Lys97). The minimum free energy binding of L-DOPA 
drug (as positive control) and CeO2 NPs were negative, resulting interaction 
between compounds and protein. As a result, these compounds inhibited 
Alpha-synuclein protein aggregation. In addition, that CeO2 NPs strongly binds 
with receptor by relative binding energy as compared with L-DOPA drug. These 
findings revealed that CeO2 NPs prevent Alpha-synuclein fibrillation and can be 
applied as nano-drug against the Parkinson's disease.

The escalating environmental concerns and energy crisis caused by internal 
combustion engines (ICE) have become unacceptable under environmental 
regulations and the energy crisis. As a promising alternative solution, 
multi-power source electric vehicles (MPS-EVs) integrate various clean energy 
systems to enhance the powertrain efficiency. The energy management strategy 
(EMS) is plays a pivotal role for MPS-EVs to maximize efficiency, fuel economy, 
and range. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an effective methodology 
for EMS development, attracting continuous attention and research. However, a 
systematic analysis of the design elements of RL-based EMS is currently lacking. 
This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of current 
research on RL-based EMS (RL-EMS) and summarizing its design elements. This 
paper first summarizes the previous applications of RL in EMS from five aspects: 
algorithm, perception scheme, decision scheme, reward function, and innovative 
training method. It highlights the contributions of advanced algorithms to 
training effectiveness, provides a detailed analysis of perception and control 
schemes, classifies different reward function settings, and elucidates the roles 
of innovative training methods. Finally, by comparing the development routes of 
RL and RL-EMS, this paper identifies the gap between advanced RL solutions and 
existing RL-EMS. Potential development directions are suggested for implementing 
advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in EMS.

Sugar dust poses significant risks in the sugar industry, threatening workers' 
safety and health as well as the potential for explosions and fires. The 
combustibility of sugar dust arises from its small, lightweight particles that 
disperse easily and ignite readily. Effective management strategies are 
essential to ensuring a safe work environment and preventing accidents. This 
perspective article provides an overview of sugar dust management in the global 
sugar industry. Various methods are employed to collect and manage sugar dust, 
including dust collectors, air handling systems, and proper housekeeping 
procedures. Advancements like electrostatic precipitators, high-efficiency 
particulate air filters, and self-cleaning dust collection systems show promise 
for future management. Utilizing both artificial intelligence and nanotechnology 
can also contribute to minimizing the concentrations of sugar dust in 
facilities. Stringent regulations and guidelines exist to control dust 
explosions in the industry. Implementation of robust safety measures and 
training programs significantly curbs the economic and environmental toll of 
sugar dust explosions. The paper concludes with recommendations to address sugar 
dust challenges, including enhanced regulation, investment in technology and 
research, and improved collaboration among industry stakeholders. These measures 
will mitigate hazards, ensure worker well-being, and safeguard the sugar 
industry's operations.

Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the 2030 
Agenda and adopted by all the United Nations member states, the 13th SDG is a 
call for action to combat climate change. Moreover, SDGs 14 and 15 claim the 
protection and conservation of life below water and life on land, respectively. 
In this work, we provide a literature-founded overview of application areas, in 
which computer audition - a powerful but in this context so far hardly 
considered technology, combining audio signal processing and machine 
intelligence - is employed to monitor our ecosystem with the potential to 
identify ecologically critical processes or states. We distinguish between 
applications related to organisms, such as species richness analysis and plant 
health monitoring, and applications related to the environment, such as melting 
ice monitoring or wildfire detection. This work positions computer audition in 
relation to alternative approaches by discussing methodological strengths and 
limitations, as well as ethical aspects. We conclude with an urgent call to 
action to the research community for a greater involvement of audio intelligence 
methodology in future ecosystem monitoring approaches.

This review aims to critically examine the existing state-of-the-art forest fire 
detection systems that are based on deep learning methods. In general, forest 
fire incidences bring significant negative impact to the economy, environment, 
and society. One of the crucial mitigation actions that needs to be readied is 
an effective forest fire detection system that are able to automatically notify 
the relevant parties on the incidence of forest fire as early as possible. This 
review paper has examined in details 37 research articles that have implemented 
deep learning (DL) model for forest fire detection, which were published between 
January 2018 and 2023. In this paper, in depth analysis has been performed to 
identify the quantity and type of data that includes images and video datasets, 
as well as data augmentation methods and the deep model architecture. This paper 
is structured into five subsections, each of which focuses on a specific 
application of deep learning (DL) in the context of forest fire detection. These 
subsections include 1) classification, 2) detection, 3) detection and 
classification, 4) segmentation, and 5) segmentation and classification. To 
compare the model's performance, the methods were evaluated using comprehensive 
metrics like accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), F1-Score, mean pixel 
accuracy (MPA), etc. From the findings, of the usage of DL models for forest 
fire surveillance systems have yielded favourable outcomes, whereby the majority 
of studies managed to achieve accuracy rates that exceeds 90%. To further 
enhance the efficacy of these models, future research can explore the optimal 
fine-tuning of the hyper-parameters, integrate various satellite data, implement 
generative data augmentation techniques, and refine the DL model architecture. 
In conclusion, this paper highlights the potential of deep learning methods in 
enhancing forest fire detection that is crucial for forest fire management and 
mitigation.

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous disease in which 
therapeutic strategies used have evolved dramatically. Despite significant 
progress in treatment strategies such as the development of anti-TNF drugs, it 
is still not possible to differentiate those patients who will respond from who 
will not. This can lead to effective-treatment delays and unnecessary costs. The 
aim of this study was to utilize a profile of the patient's characteristics, 
clinical parameters, immune status (cytokine profile) and artificial 
intelligence to assess the feasibility of developing a tool that could allow us 
to predict which patients will respond to treatment with anti-TNF drugs.
METHODS: This study included 38 patients with RA from the RA-Paz cohort. 
Clinical activity was measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. The 
cytokines measured before the start of anti-TNF treatment were IL-1, IL-12, 
IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, IFNg, TNFa, and IL-6. Statistical analyses were performed 
using the Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum Test and the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The 
predictive model viability was explored using the 5-fold cross-validation scheme 
in order to train the logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in parameters such as 
IL-6, IL-2, CRP and DAS-ESR. The predictive model performed to an acceptable 
level in correctly classifying patients (ROC-AUC 0.804167 to 0.891667), 
suggesting that it would be possible to develop a clinical classification tool.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of parameters such as IL-6, IL-2, CRP and 
DAS-ESR, it was possible to develop a predictive model that can acceptably 
discriminate between remitters and non-remitters. However, this model needs to 
be replicated in a larger cohort to confirm these findings.

Ambient Intelligence is a concept that relates to a new paradigm of pervasive 
computing and has the objective of automating responses from the system to 
humans without any human intervention. In social media forensics, gathering, 
analyzing, storing, and validating relevant evidence for investigation in a 
heterogeneous environment is still questionable. There is no hierarchy for 
automation, even though standardization and secure processes from data 
collection to validation have not yet been discussed. This poses serious issues 
for the current investigation procedures and future evidence chain of custody 
management. This paper contributes threefold. First, it proposes a framework 
using a blockchain network with a dual chain of data transmission for privacy 
protection, such as on-chain and off-chain. Second, a protocol is designed to 
detect and separate local and global cyber threats and undermine multiple 
federated principles to personalize search space broadly. Third, this study 
manages personalized updates by means of optimizing backtracking parameters and 
automating replacements, which directly affects the reduction of negative 
influence on the social networking environment in terms of imbalanced and 
distributed data issues. This proposed framework enhances stability in digital 
investigation. In addition, the simulation uses an extensive social media 
dataset in different cyberspaces with a variety of cyber threats to investigate. 
The proposed work outperformed as compared to traditional single-level 
personalized search and other state-of-the-art schemes.

The attention level of students in a classroom can be improved through the use 
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. By automatically identifying the 
attention level, teachers can employ strategies to regain students' focus. This 
can be achieved through various sources of information. One source is to analyze 
the emotions reflected on students' faces. AI can detect emotions, such as 
neutral, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, happiness, and anger. Additionally, 
the direction of the students' gaze can also potentially indicate their level of 
attention. Another source is to observe the students' body posture. By using 
cameras and deep learning techniques, posture can be analyzed to determine the 
level of attention. For example, students who are slouching or resting their 
heads on their desks may have a lower level of attention. Smartwatches 
distributed to the students can provide biometric and other data, including 
heart rate and inertial measurements, which can also be used as indicators of 
attention. By combining these sources of information, an AI system can be 
trained to identify the level of attention in the classroom. However, 
integrating the different types of data poses a challenge that requires creating 
a labeled dataset. Expert input and existing studies are consulted for accurate 
labeling. In this paper, we propose the integration of such measurements and the 
creation of a dataset and a potential attention classifier. To provide feedback 
to the teacher, we explore various methods, such as smartwatches or direct 
computers. Once the teacher becomes aware of attention issues, they can adjust 
their teaching approach to re-engage and motivate the students. In summary, AI 
techniques can automatically identify the students' attention level by analyzing 
their emotions, gaze direction, body posture, and biometric data. This 
information can assist teachers in optimizing the teaching-learning process.

INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to impact all facets of 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, including disease assessment, 
treatment decisions, discovery and development of new biomarkers and 
therapeutics, as well as clinician-patient communication.
AREAS COVERED: This perspective paper provides an overview of the application of 
AI in the clinical management of IBD through a review of the currently available 
AI models that could be potential tools for prognosis, shared decision-making, 
and precision medicine. This overview covers models that measure treatment 
response based on statistical or machine-learning methods, or a combination of 
the two. We briefly discuss a computational model that allows integration of 
immune/biological system knowledge with mathematical modeling and also involves 
a 'digital twin', which allows measurement of temporal trends in mucosal 
inflammatory activity for predicting treatment response. A viewpoint on 
AI-enabled wearables and nearables and their use to improve IBD management is 
also included.
EXPERT OPINION: Although challenges regarding data quality, privacy, and 
security; ethical concerns; technical limitations; and regulatory barriers 
remain to be fully addressed, a growing body of evidence suggests a tremendous 
potential for integration of AI into daily clinical practice to enable precision 
medicine and shared decision-making.

Plain Language Summary: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show promise 
for improving treatment response prediction, decision-making, and precision 
medicine in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).In particular, AI could improve 
precision medicine for IBD by enabling identification of disease subtypes, 
prediction of disease progression and treatment response, selection of 
personalized treatments, and remote monitoring.Predictive models can benefit 
clinicians and patients alike by optimizing shared decision-making processes; 
patients can also use AI to cope with daily and long-term challenges of the 
disease.Beyond patients and practitioners, predictive models may positively 
impact healthcare structures and payers by enabling effective 
healthcare-resource utilization.To increase the accuracy and efficiency of AI 
models, biomarkers, patient-reported outcomes, and disease scores should be 
combined within predictive models, and the outputs should be compared with 
clinical trial data and real-world data for validation.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the performance, time-efficiency, and consistency of a 
convolutional neural network (CNN) based automated approach for integrated 
segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures compared with semi-automated 
method for creating a virtual patient using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
scans.
METHODS: Thirty CBCT scans were selected. Six craniomaxillofacial structures, 
encompassing the maxillofacial complex bones, maxillary sinus, dentition, 
mandible, mandibular canal, and pharyngeal airway space, were segmented on these 
scans using semi-automated and composite of previously validated CNN-based 
automated segmentation techniques for individual structures. A qualitative 
assessment of the automated segmentation revealed the need for minor 
refinements, which were manually corrected. These refined segmentations served 
as a reference for comparing semi-automated and automated integrated 
segmentations.
RESULTS: The majority of minor adjustments with the automated approach involved 
under-segmentation of sinus mucosal thickening and regions with reduced bone 
thickness within the maxillofacial complex. The automated and the semi-automated 
approaches required an average time of 1.1 min and 48.4 min, respectively. The 
automated method demonstrated a greater degree of similarity (99.6 %) to the 
reference than the semi-automated approach (88.3 %). The standard deviation 
values for all metrics with the automated approach were low, indicating a high 
consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The CNN-driven integrated segmentation approach proved to be 
accurate, time-efficient, and consistent for creating a CBCT-derived virtual 
patient through simultaneous segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The creation of a virtual orofacial patient using an 
automated approach could potentially transform personalized digital workflows. 
This advancement could be particularly beneficial for treatment planning in a 
variety of dental and maxillofacial specialties.

BACKGROUND: The role of P wave in identifying left atrial enlargement (LAE) 
using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) models is 
unclear. It is also unknown if AI-enabled single-lead ECGs could be used as a 
diagnostic tool for LAE surveillance. We aimed to build AI-enabled P-wave and 
single-lead ECG models to identify LAE using sinus rhythm (SR) and/or non-SR 
ECGs, and compared the prognostic ability of severe LAE as left atrial diameter 
(LAD) ≥50 mm assessed by AI-enabled ECG models and echocardiography.
METHODS: This retrospective study used data from 382,594 consecutive adults with 
paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiograms measured within 2 weeks at Chang Gung 
Memorial Hospital. UNet++ was used for P-wave segmentation. ResNet-18 was used 
to develop deep convolutional neural network-enabled ECG models for 
discriminating LAE. External validation was performed using data from 11,753 
patients from another hospital.
RESULTS: The AI-enabled 12-lead ECG model outperformed other ECG models for 
classifying LAE, but the single-lead ECG models also showed excellent 
performance at an LAD cut-off 50 mm. AI-enabled ECG models had excellent and 
fair discrimination on LAE using the SR and the non-SR dataset, respectively. 
Severe LAE identified by AI-enabled ECG models was more predictive of future 
cardiovascular disease than echocardiography; however, the cumulative incidence 
of new-onset atrial fibrillation and heart failure was higher in patients with 
echocardiography-severe LAE than AI-enabled ECG-severe LAE.
CONCLUSIONS: P wave plays a crucial role in discriminating LAE in AI-enabled ECG 
models. AI-enabled ECG models outperform echocardiography in predicting 
new-onset cardiovascular diseases associated with severe LAE.

As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine grows, it is imperative 
for physicians to understand how it can help shape their practice. Whether one 
wishes to develop novel applications of AI in medicine or become an 
early-adopter and end-user of AI-based platforms, an in-depth understanding of 
the capabilities and limitations of AI is crucial. In this brief article, we aim 
to provide the reader an introduction into machine learning methods, a review of 
current efforts to integrate AI into cardiology research and clinical 
implementation, and practical steps for cardiologists and cardiology trainees to 
begin utilizing these remarkable tools.

BACKGROUND: The performance of existing image-based training models in 
evaluating bowel preparation on colonoscopy videos was relatively low, and only 
a few models used external data to prove their generalization. Therefore, this 
study attempted to develop a more precise and stable AI system for assessing 
bowel preparation of colonoscopy video.
METHODS: We proposed a system named ViENDO to assess the bowel preparation 
quality, including two CNNs. First, Information-Net was used to identify and 
filter out colonoscopy video frames unsuitable for Boston bowel preparation 
scale (BBPS) scoring. Second, BBPS-Net was trained and tested with 5,566 
suitable short video clips through three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural 
network (CNN) technology to detect BBPS-based insufficient bowel preparation. 
Then, ViENDO was applied to complete withdrawal colonoscopy videos from multiple 
centers to predict BBPS segment scores in clinical settings. We also conducted a 
human-machine contest to compare its performance with endoscopists.
RESULTS: In video clips, BBPS-Net for determining inadequate bowel preparation 
generated an area under the curve of up to 0.98 and accuracy of 95.2%. When 
applied to full-length withdrawal colonoscopy videos, ViENDO assessed bowel 
cleanliness with an accuracy of 93.8% in the internal test set and 91.7% in the 
external dataset. The human-machine contest demonstrated that the accuracy of 
ViENDO was slightly superior compared to most endoscopists, though no 
statistical significance was found.
CONCLUSION: The 3D-CNN-based AI model showed good performance in evaluating 
full-length bowel preparation on colonoscopy video. It has the potential as a 
substitute for endoscopists to provide BBPS-based assessments during daily 
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the inefficiency and high cost of the current healthcare 
supply chain mode, in order to adapt to the great changes in the global economy 
and public health, it is urgent to choose an effective mode for sustainable 
development of healthcare supply chain. The aim of this paper is to use 
artificial intelligence systems to make intelligent decisions for healthcare 
supply chain mode selection.
METHODS: Firstly, according to the economic benefits, social benefits and 
environmental benefits of healthcare supply chain, this paper identifies 
different healthcare supply chain modes in combination with artificial 
intelligence technology. Secondly, this paper presents the intelligent choice 
optimization method of healthcare supply chain mode based on deep reinforcement 
learning algorithm. Finally, the effect of artificial intelligence in healthcare 
supply chain mode selection is verified by simulation experiment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The experimental results show that healthcare supply 
chain mode selected by artificial intelligence is basically consistent with the 
target mode, while healthcare supply chain mode selected by the basic selection 
method, BP neural network method and big data method is different from the 
target mode, which indicates that AI has more advantages in the selection of 
medical supply chain mode. Therefore, we recommend the application of artificial 
intelligence to healthcare supply chain management. This study not only makes up 
for the ineffective problems of existing methods, but also makes up for the gaps 
in the application of AI technology in the field of healthcare supply chain. The 
scientific value of this paper is that the proposed framework and the artificial 
intelligence algorithm enrich the relevant theories of healthcare supply chain 
research and provide methodological guidance for intelligent decision-making of 
healthcare supply chain. At the same time, for medical enterprises, this 
research provides a new practical guideline for the application of artificial 
intelligence in the sustainable development and modern management of healthcare 
supply chain.

This paper presents a study on the use of AI models for the classification of 
case reports on assisted suicide procedures. The database of the five Dutch 
regional bioethics committees was scraped to collect the 72 case reports 
available in English. We trained several AI models for classification according 
to the categories defined by the Dutch Termination of Life on Request and 
Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act. We also conducted a related project to 
fine-tune an OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo large language model for generating new 
fictional but plausible cases. As AI is increasingly being used for judgement, 
it is possible to imagine an application in decision-making regarding assisted 
suicide. Here we explore two arising questions: feasibility and ethics, with the 
aim of contributing to a critical assessment of the potential role of AI in 
decision-making in highly sensitive areas.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of an artificial intelligence (AI) model, 
ChatGPT, in predicting the diabetic retinopathy (DR) risk.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study utilized an anonymized dataset 
of 111 patients with diabetes who underwent a comprehensive eye examination 
along with clinical and biochemical assessments. Clinical and biochemical data 
along with and without central subfield thickness (CST) values of the macula 
from OCT were uploaded to ChatGPT-4, and the response from the ChatGPT was 
compared to the clinical DR diagnosis made by an ophthalmologist.
RESULTS: The study assessed the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT, 
yielding an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) value of 0.936 (95% CI, 
0.913-0.954, p < 0.001) (with CST) and 0.915 (95% CI, 0.706-0.846, p < 0.001) 
(without CST), both situations indicated excellent reliability. The sensitivity 
and specificity of ChatGPT in predicting the DR cases were evaluated. The 
results revealed a sensitivity of 67% with CST and 73% without CST. The 
specificity was 68% with CST and 54% without CST. However, Cohen's kappa 
revealed only a fair agreement between ChatGPT predictions and clinical DR 
status in both situations, with CST (kappa = 0.263, p = 0.005) and without CST 
(kappa = 0.351, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that ChatGPT has the potential of a preliminary 
DR screening tool with further optimization needed for clinical use.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GM pathology plays an essential role in MS disability 
progression, emphasizing the importance of neuroradiologic biomarkers to capture 
the heterogeneity of cortical disease burden. This study aimed to assess the 
validity of a patch-wise, individual interpretation of cortical thickness data 
to identify GM pathology, the "mosaic approach," which was previously suggested 
as a biomarker for assessing and localizing atrophy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mosaic approach in a cohort of 501 
patients with MS with respect to 89 internal and 651 external controls. The 
resulting metric of the mosaic approach is the so-called thin patch fraction, 
which is an estimate of overall cortical disease burden per patient. We 
evaluated the mosaic approach with respect to the following: 1) discrimination 
between patients with MS and controls, 2) classification between different MS 
phenotypes, and 3) association with established biomarkers reflecting MS disease 
burden, using general linear modeling.
RESULTS: The thin patch fraction varied significantly between patients with MS 
and healthy controls and discriminated among MS phenotypes. Furthermore, the 
thin patch fraction was associated with disease burden, including the Expanded 
Disability Status Scale, cognitive and fatigue scores, and lesion volume.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the validity of the mosaic approach as a 
neuroradiologic biomarker in MS. The output of the mosaic approach, namely the 
thin patch fraction, is a candidate biomarker for assessing and localizing 
cortical GM pathology. The mosaic approach can furthermore enhance the 
development of a personalized cortical MS biomarker, given that the thin patch 
fraction provides a feature on which artificial intelligence methods can be 
trained. Most important, we showed the validity of the mosaic approach when 
referencing data with respect to external control MR imaging repositories.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brainomix e-Stroke is an artificial intelligence-based 
decision support tool that aids the interpretation of CT imaging in the context 
of acute stroke. While e-Stroke has the potential to improve the speed and 
accuracy of diagnosis, real-world validation is essential. The aim of this study 
was to prospectively evaluate the performance of Brainomix e-Stroke in an 
unselected cohort of patients with suspected acute ischaemic stroke.
METHODS: The study cohort included all patients admitted to the University 
College London Hospital Hyperacute Stroke Unit between October 2021 and April 
2022. For e-ASPECTS and e-CTA, the ground truth was determined by a 
neuroradiologist with access to all clinical and imaging data. For e-CTP, the 
values of the core infarct and ischaemic penumbra were compared with those 
derived from syngo.via, an alternate software used at our institution.
RESULTS: 1163 studies were performed in 551 patients admitted during the study 
period. Of these, 1130 (97.2%) were successfully processed by e-Stroke in an 
average of 4 min. For identifying acute middle cerebral artery territory 
ischaemia, e-ASPECTS had an accuracy of 77.0% and was more specific (83.5%) than 
sensitive (58.6%). The accuracy for identifying hyperdense thrombus was lower 
(69.1%), which was mainly due to many false positives (positive predictive value 
of 22.9%). Identification of acute haemorrhage was highly accurate (97.8%) with 
a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.6%; false positives were typically 
caused by areas of calcification. The accuracy of e-CTA for large vessel 
occlusions was 91.5%. The core infarct and ischaemic penumbra volumes provided 
by e-CTP strongly correlated with those provided by syngo.via (ρ=0.804-0.979).
CONCLUSION: Brainomix e-Stroke software provides rapid and reliable analysis of 
CT imaging in the acute stroke setting although, in line with the manufacturer's 
guidance, it should be used as an adjunct to expert interpretation rather than a 
standalone decision-making tool.

Medical education assessment faces multifaceted challenges, including data 
complexity, resource constraints, bias, feedback translation, and educational 
continuity. Traditional approaches often fail to adequately address these 
issues, creating stressful and inequitable learning environments. This article 
introduces the concept of precision education, a data-driven paradigm aimed at 
personalizing the educational experience for each learner. It explores how 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its subsets Machine Learning (ML) and 
Deep Learning (DL), can augment this model to tackle the inherent limitations of 
traditional assessment methods.AI can enable proactive data collection, offering 
consistent and objective assessments while reducing resource burdens. It has the 
potential to revolutionize not only competency assessment but also participatory 
interventions, such as personalized coaching and predictive analytics for 
at-risk trainees. The article also discusses key challenges and ethical 
considerations in integrating AI into medical education, such as algorithmic 
transparency, data privacy, and the potential for bias propagation.AI's capacity 
to process large datasets and identify patterns allows for a more nuanced, 
individualized approach to medical education. It offers promising avenues to not 
only improve the efficiency of educational assessments but also to make them 
more equitable. However, the ethical and technical challenges must be diligently 
addressed. The article concludes that embracing AI in medical education 
assessment is a strategic move toward creating a more personalized, effective, 
and fair educational landscape. This necessitates collaborative, 
multidisciplinary research and ethical vigilance to ensure that the technology 
serves educational goals while upholding social justice and ethical integrity.

Purpose To evaluate the performance of a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
tool by comparing the quantified stenosis severity at coronary CT angiography 
(CCTA) with a reference standard derived from invasive quantitative coronary 
angiography (QCA). Materials and Methods This secondary, post hoc analysis 
included 120 participants (mean age, 59.7 years ± 10.8 [SD]; 73 [60.8%] men, 47 
[39.2%] women) from three large clinical trials (AFFECTS, P3, REFINE) who 
underwent CCTA and invasive coronary angiography with QCA. Quantitative analysis 
of coronary stenosis severity at CCTA was performed using an AI-based coronary 
stenosis quantification (AI-CSQ) software service. Blinded comparison between 
QCA and AI-CSQ was measured on a per-vessel and per-patient basis. Results The 
per-vessel AI-CSQ diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive 
predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80%, 88%, 86%, 65%, and 
94%, respectively, for diameter stenosis (DS) 50% or greater; and 78%, 92%, 91%, 
47%, and 98%, respectively, for DS 70% or greater. The areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUCs) to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or 
greater on a per-vessel basis were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.95; P < .001) and 0.93 
(95% CI: 0.89, 0.97; P < .001), respectively. The AUCs to predict DS of 50% or 
greater and 70% or greater on a per-patient basis were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.97; 
P < .001) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; P < .001), respectively. Conclusion 
AI-CSQ at CCTA demonstrated a high diagnostic performance compared with QCA both 
on a per-patient and per-vessel basis, with high sensitivity for stenosis 
detection. Keywords: CT Angiography, Cardiac, Coronary Arteries Supplemental

The US drug labeling document contains essential information on drug efficacy 
and safety, making it a crucial regulatory resource for Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) drug reviewers. Due to its extensive volume and the 
presence of free-text, conventional text mining analysis have encountered 
challenges in processing these data. Recent advances in artificial intelligence 
(AI) for natural language processing (NLP) have provided an unprecedented 
opportunity to identify key information from drug labeling, thereby enhancing 
safety reviews and support for regulatory decisions. We developed RxBERT, a 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model pretrained 
on FDA human prescription drug labeling documents for an enhanced application of 
drug labeling documents in both research and drug review. RxBERT was derived 
from BioBERT with further training on human prescription drug labeling 
documents. RxBERT was demonstrated in several tasks using regulatory datasets, 
including those involved in the National Institutes of Technology Text Analysis 
Challenge Dataset (NIST TAC dataset), the FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation 
Dataset (ADE Eval dataset), and the classification of texts from submission 
packages into labeling sections (US Drug Labeling dataset). For all these tasks, 
RxBERT reached 86.5 F1-scores in both TAC and ADE Eval classification, 
respectively, and prediction accuracy of 87% for the US Drug Labeling dataset. 
Overall, RxBERT was shown to be as competitive or have better performance 
compared to other NLP approaches such as BERT, BioBERT, etc. In summary, we 
developed RxBERT, a transformer-based model specific for drug labeling that 
outperformed the original BERT model. RxBERT has the potential to be used to 
assist research scientists and FDA reviewers to better process and utilize drug 
labeling information toward the advancement of drug effectiveness and safety for 
public health. This proof-of-concept study also demonstrated a potential pathway 
to customized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the sensitive regulatory 
documents for internal application.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes 
uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them, 
typically during periods of rest. The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS 
are incompletely understood. Here, we present a whole-genome sequencing and 
genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (n = 9,851) and controls (n = 
38,957) in three population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal 
Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE). Genome-wide association analysis identified nine 
independent risk loci, of which eight had been previously reported, and one was 
a novel risk locus (LMX1B, rs35196838, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-1.19, p-value = 
2.2 × 10-9). A genome-wide, gene-based common variant analysis identified GLO1 
as an additional risk gene (p-value = 8.45 × 10-7). Furthermore, a 
transcriptome-wide association study also identified GLO1 and a previously 
unreported gene, ELFN1. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant 
common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (rg = 0.40, se = 0.08, 
p-value = 5.4 × 10-7), depression (rg = 0.35, se = 0.06, p-value = 2.17 × 10-8), 
and intelligence (rg = -0.20, se = 0.06, p-value = 4.0 × 10-4). Our study 
expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS and highlights the 
contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may progress to ipsilateral invasive breast 
cancer (iIBC), but often never will. Because DCIS is treated as early breast 
cancer, many women with harmless DCIS face overtreatment. To identify these 
women that may forego treatment, we hypothesized that DCIS morphometric features 
relate to the risk of subsequent iIBC. We developed an artificial 
intelligence-based DCIS morphometric analysis pipeline (AIDmap) to detect DCIS 
as a pathologist and measure morphological structures in 
hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. These were from a case-control 
study of patients diagnosed with primary DCIS, treated by breast-conserving 
surgery without radiotherapy. We analyzed 689 WSIs of DCIS of which 226 were 
diagnosed with subsequent iIBC (cases) and 463 were not (controls). The 
distribution of 15 duct morphological measurements in each H&E was summarized in 
55 morphometric variables. A ridge regression classifier with cross validation 
predicted 5-years-free of iIBC with an area-under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 
0.55-0.76). A morphometric signature based on the 30 variables most associated 
with outcome, identified lesions containing small-sized ducts, low number of 
cells and low DCIS/stroma area ratio. This signature was associated with lower 
iIBC risk in a multivariate regression model including grade, ER, HER2 and COX-2 
expression (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-0.78). AIDmap has potential to identify 
harmless DCIS that may not need treatment.

Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is responsible for ~10,000 
deaths annually in the United States. Stratification of risk of poor outcome 
(PO) including recurrence, metastasis and disease specific death (DSD) at 
initial biopsy would significantly impact clinical decision-making during the 
initial post operative period where intervention has been shown to be most 
effective. In this multi-institutional study, we developed a state-of-the-art 
self-supervised deep-learning approach with interpretability power and 
demonstrated its ability to predict poor outcomes of cSCCs at the time of 
initial biopsy. By highlighting histomorphological phenotypes, our approach 
demonstrates that poor differentiation and deep invasion correlate with poor 
prognosis. Our approach is particularly efficient at defining poor outcome risk 
in Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) T2a and American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) T2 cSCCs. This bridges a significant gap in our ability to assess risk 
among T2a/T2 cSCCs and may be useful in defining patients at highest risk of 
poor outcome at the time of diagnosis. Early identification of highest-risk 
patients could signal implementation of more stringent surveillance, rigorous 
diagnostic work up and identify patients who might best respond to early 
postoperative adjunctive treatment.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cognitive abilities are a predictor of health outcomes and 
adult income potential. Identifying factors associated with childhood 
intelligence and their interactions is essential in behavioral research. We 
assessed the impact of genetic variants and early child stimulation (ECS) on 
child intelligence and examined their possible interaction as potential 
modifiers of IQ in a population-based longitudinal study.
METHODS: Participants of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study (N = 4231) 
underwent intelligent quotient (IQ) by WISC-III assessment at 6 years of age. At 
24 and 48-months, mothers answered five ECS marker questions, whose sum was used 
to create a score. The polygenic score for intelligence (IQ-PGS) was constructed 
from the GWAS-weighted estimate of cognition. Association was assessed using 
multiple linear regression models adjusted for maternal, family, and child 
confounding variables. To explore the possible influence of skin color and 
ethnoracial classification, the regression models were stratified according to 
the skin color variable, as a sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, IQ-PGS (β = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 
[95% CI] 0.26;1.31) as well as ECS (β = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.76;2.92) were associated 
with IQ in this sample. The association between IQ-PGS and IQ was significant 
only in the white Brazilian group in the sensitivity analysis. However, there 
was no interaction between IQ-PGS and ECS on IQ (p(IQ-PGS x ECS) = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: ECS did not modify the impact of genetic potential on intellectual 
development during childhood, suggesting that genetic factors and ECS exert 
independent effects on the IQ levels of children.

Subsurface interpretations and models rely on knowledge from subject matter 
experts who utilize unstructured information from images, maps, cross sections, 
and other products to provide context to measured data (e. g., cores, well logs, 
seismic surveys). To enhance such knowledge discovery, we advanced the National 
Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL) Subsurface Trend Analysis (STA) workflow 
with an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning approach for image embedding. 
NETL's STA method offers a validated science-based approach of combining 
geologic systems knowledge, statistical modeling, and datasets to improve 
predictions of subsurface properties. The STA image embedding tool quickly 
extracts images from unstructured knowledge products like publications, maps, 
websites, and presentations; categorically labels the images; and creates a 
repository for geologic domain postulation. Via a case study on geographic and 
subsurface literature of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), results show the STA image 
embedding tool extracts images and correctly labels them with ~90 to ~95% 
accuracy.

To propose improved and innovative visual-tactile interaction design for 
visually impaired children, multi-modal combination approaches have been 
applied, such as voice interaction, touch interaction, and multi-modal systems, 
what's more, aided cognitive approaches help them deepen their understanding of 
objects, improve their cognitive level, and increase their interest.
METHODS: To improve the amount of information in the visual-haptic interface by 
integrating multiple sensory information, based on the cognitive patterns of 
visually impaired children, a questionnaire was used to design a tactile-visual 
UI for the main content objects of visually impaired children when using the 
Internet, from which difficulties and problems in the design of visual-haptic 
for visually impaired children were found, and design improvements were proposed 
based on the principles and methods of accessible design.
RESULTS: The personalized and humanized design activities enhance the confidence 
and improve the quality of life of the visually impaired children group and 
produce positive effects, improving the cognitive clarity of visually impaired 
children while increasing their level of understanding, imagination, learning 
interest and aesthetic experience.
CONCLUSION: The physical and mental characteristics and visual and tactile 
characteristics of visually impaired children are analyzed, and the application 
of UI interaction design is based on these characteristics. The essence of 
interaction design is outlined through experiments, and it is found that with 
the development of the Internet, big data and artificial intelligence, visually 
impaired children have many difficulties in the use of the Internet, and through 
the improved practice of immersive interaction design, the humanized design 
approach is used to enhance visually impaired children's experience of using 
network interfaces. Through the improved practice of immersive interaction 
design, we improve the way of visually impaired children using the Internet, 
narrow the gap between them and normal children in the interaction, and give 
humanistic care.

augmentation.

Hefei, China.

INTRODUCTION: Decades of research have been dedicated to overcoming the 
obstacles inherent in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target 
recognition (ATR). The rise of deep learning technologies has brought a wave of 
new possibilities, demonstrating significant progress in the field. However, 
challenges like the susceptibility of SAR images to noise, the requirement for 
large-scale training datasets, and the often protracted duration of model 
training still persist.
METHODS: This paper introduces a novel data augmentation strategy to address 
these issues. Our method involves the intentional addition and subsequent 
removal of speckle noise to artificially enlarge the scope of training data 
through noise perturbation. Furthermore, we propose a modified network 
architecture named weighted ResNet, which incorporates residual strain controls 
for enhanced performance. This network is designed to be computationally 
efficient and to minimize the amount of training data required.
RESULTS: Through rigorous experimental analysis, our research confirms that the 
proposed data augmentation method, when used in conjunction with the weighted 
ResNet model, significantly reduces the time needed for training. It also 
improves the SAR ATR capabilities.
DISCUSSION: Compared to existing models and methods tested, the combination of 
our data augmentation scheme and the weighted ResNet framework achieves higher 
computational efficiency and better recognition accuracy in SAR ATR 
applications. This suggests that our approach could be a valuable advancement in 
the field of SAR image analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the applicability of artificial intelligence-assisted 
compressed sensing (ACS) to anal fistula magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: 51 patients were included in this study and underwent T2-weighted 
sequence of MRI examinations both with ACS and without ACS technology in a 
3.0 T MR scanner. Subjective image quality scores, and objective image 
quality-related metrics including scanning time, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), were evaluated and statistically compared 
between the images collected with and without ACS.
RESULTS: No significant difference in the subjective image quality of lesion 
conspicuity was observed between the two groups. However, ACS MRI decreased the 
acquisition time with regard to control group (74.00 s vs. 156.00 s). Besides, 
SNR of perianal and muscle in the ACS group was significantly higher than that 
of the control group (164.07 ± 33.35 vs 130.81 ± 29.10, p < 0.001; 
109.87 ± 22.01 vs 87.61 ± 17.95, p < 0.001; respectively). The CNR was 
significantly higher in the ACS group than in the control group (54.02 ± 23.98 
vs 43.20 ± 21.00; p < 0.001). Moreover, the accuracy rate of the ACS groups in 
evaluating the direction and internal opening of the fistula was 88.89 %, 
exactly the same as that of the control group.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the applicability of using ACS to accelerate MR of 
anal fistulas with improved SNR and CNR. Meanwhile, the accuracy rates of the 
ACS group and the control were equivalent in evaluating the direction and 
internal opening of the fistula, based on the results of surgical exploration.

This work aims to optimize the physical education (PE) teaching effect based on 
deep learning (DL) to cultivate high-level college students better. Firstly, the 
present situation of college teachers' teaching ability is surveyed to realize 
the deficiencies in teaching. Secondly, an optimization algorithm is proposed to 
improve the node splitting mode. This algorithm can solve the problem of single 
and similar node splitting modes in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The 
independent node splitting method Iterative Dichotomiser 3 and Classification 
and Regression Tree in the algorithm are recombined, and new splitting rules are 
obtained through adaptive parameter selection. Finally, the scheme designed is 
tested. The results suggest: The results suggest: (1) During the training of the 
proposed algorithm, although the loss curve at 4550 and 6800 points has a small 
crest, the error of the network loss function shows a downward trend and tends 
to be flat; (2) Compared with unoptimized Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Genetic 
Algorithm-Back Propagation (GA-BP), the proposed algorithm shows better 
performance both in terms of time consumption and accuracy (time consumption is 
less than 5.4 ms, and accuracy is more than 95 %). In a word, using the GA-BP-RF 
algorithm proposed to improve the PE teaching effect is feasible. The proposed 
model provides ideas for applying DL technology to improve teachers' teaching 
abilities.

INTRODUCTION: Hypothyroidism can be easily misdiagnosed in dogs, and prediction 
models can support clinical decision-making, avoiding unnecessary testing and 
treatment. The aim of this study is to develop and internally validate 
diagnostic prediction models for hypothyroidism in dogs by applying 
machine-learning algorithms.
METHODS: A single-institutional cross-sectional study was designed searching the 
electronic database of a Veterinary Teaching Hospital for dogs tested for 
hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed based on suggestive clinical signs 
and thyroid function tests. Dogs were excluded if medical records were 
incomplete or a definitive diagnosis was lacking. Predictors identified after 
data processing were dermatological signs, alopecia, lethargy, hematocrit, serum 
concentrations of cholesterol, creatinine, total thyroxine (tT4), and 
thyrotropin (cTSH). Four models were created by combining clinical signs and 
clinicopathological variables expressed as quantitative (models 1 and 2) and 
qualitative variables (models 3 and 4). Models 2 and 4 included tT4 and cTSH, 
models 1 and 3 did not. Six different algorithms were applied to each model. 
Internal validation was performed using a 10-fold cross-validation. Apparent 
performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: Eighty-two hypothyroid and 233 euthyroid client-owned dogs were 
included. The best performing algorithms were naive Bayes in model 1 
(AUROC = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83-0.86) and in model 2 
(AUROC = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97-0.99), logistic regression in model 3 
(AUROC = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.86-0.89), and random forest in model 4 (AUROC = 0.99; 
95% CI = 0.98-0.99). Positive predictive value was 0.76, 0.84, 0.93, and 0.97 in 
model 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Negative predictive value was 0.89, 0.89, 
0.99, and 0.99 in model 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Machine learning-based prediction models were accurate in predicting 
and quantifying the likelihood of hypothyroidism in dogs based on internal 
validation performed in a single-institution, but external validation is 
required to support the clinical applicability of these models.

BACKGROUND: Due to the limitations of current methods for detecting obstructive 
coronary artery disease (CAD), many individuals are mistakenly or unnecessarily 
referred for coronary angiography (CAG).
OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to create a comprehensive database of heart sounds in 
CAD and develop accurate deep learning algorithms to efficiently detect 
obstructive CAD based on heart sound signals. This will enable effective 
screening before undergoing CAG.
METHODS: We included 320 subjects suspected of CAD who underwent CAG. We 
employed advanced filtering techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models 
(VGG-16, 1D CNN, and ResNet18) to analyze the heart sound signals and identify 
obstructive CAD (defined as at least one ≥50 % stenosis). To assess the 
performance of our models, we prospectively recruited an additional 80 subjects 
for testing.
RESULTS: In the test set, VGG-16 exhibited the highest performance with an area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.834 (95 % CI, 0.736-0.930), while ResNet-18 and 
CNN-7 achieved AUCs of only 0.755 (95 % CI, 0.614-0.819) and 0.652 (95 % CI, 
0.554-0.770) respectively. VGG-16 demonstrated a sensitivity of 80.4 % and 
specificity of 86.2 % in the test set. The combined diagnostic model of VGG and 
DF scores achieved an AUC of 0.915 (95 % CI: 0.855-0.974), and the AUC for VGG 
combined with PTP scores was 0.908 (95 % CI: 0.845-0.971). The sensitivity and 
specificity of VGG-16 exceeded 0.85 in patients with coronary artery occlusion 
and those with 3 vascular lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning model, based on heart sounds, offers a 
non-invasive and efficient screening method for obstructive CAD. It is expected 
to significantly reduce the number of unnecessary referrals for downstream 
screening.

Diabetes Mellitus, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has no cure to 
date and can lead to severe health complications, such as retinopathy, limb 
amputation, cardiovascular diseases, and neuronal disease, if left untreated. 
Consequently, it becomes crucial to be able to monitor and predict the incidence 
of diabetes. Machine learning approaches have been proposed and evaluated in the 
literature for diabetes prediction. This paper proposes an IoT-edge-Artificial 
Intelligence (AI)-blockchain system for diabetes prediction based on risk 
factors. The proposed system is underpinned by blockchain to obtain a cohesive 
view of the risk factors data from patients across different hospitals and 
ensure security and privacy of the user's data. We provide a comparative 
analysis of different medical sensors, devices, and methods to measure and 
collect the risk factors values in the system. Numerical experiments and 
comparative analysis were carried out within our proposed system, using the most 
accurate random forest (RF) model, and the two most used state-of-the-art 
machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), using three real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that the 
proposed system predicts diabetes using RF with 4.57% more accuracy on average 
in comparison with the other models LR and SVM, with 2.87 times more execution 
time. Data balancing without feature selection does not show significant 
improvement. When using feature selection, the performance is improved by 1.14% 
for PIMA Indian and 0.02% for Sylhet datasets, while it is reduced by 0.89% for 
MIMIC III.

Neural networks have become one of the most popularly used methods in machine 
learning and artificial intelligence. Due to the universal approximation theorem 
(Hornik et al., 1989), a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate 
any continuous function on compact support as long as the number of hidden units 
is sufficiently large. Statistically, a neural network can be classified into a 
nonlinear regression framework. However, if we consider it parametrically, due 
to the unidentifiability of the parameters, it is difficult to derive its 
asymptotic properties. Instead, we consider the estimation problem in a 
nonparametric regression framework and use the results from sieve estimation to 
establish the consistency, the rates of convergence and the asymptotic normality 
of the neural network estimators. We also illustrate the validity of the 
theories via simulations.

Background and aim Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are disorders where 
no organic clinical abnormalities are detected such as functional dyspepsia (FD) 
and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The brain activity of individuals with FD 
and IBS differs from that of healthy controls. Artificial intelligence can 
distinguish healthy controls from individuals with DGBI using several 
biomarkers. This study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-based 
diagnostic support system using food preferences and brain activity in patients 
with DGBI. Methods ROME IV criteria were used to diagnose patients with FD and 
IBS. Their food preference was scored using a visual analog scale, and brain 
activity in the prefrontal cortex was investigated using functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The diagnostic model was developed based on 
the brain activity and visual analog scale scores for food using an artificial 
neural network model. Results Forty-one participants, including 25 patients with 
DGBI were enrolled in the study. The accuracy of the artificial 
intelligence-based diagnostic model using an artificial neural network in 
differentiating between healthy controls and patients with DGBI and between 
healthy controls and those with FD were 72.3% and 77.1%, respectively. 
Conclusions The artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using brain 
activity and preference to food images showed sufficiently high accuracy in 
distinguishing patients with DGBI from healthy controls, and those with FD from 
healthy controls. Therefore, the fNIRS system provides objective evidence for 
diagnosing DGBI.

AIMS: The increasing use of insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) produces a high 
rate of false positive (FP) diagnoses. Their verification results in a high 
workload for caregivers. We evaluated the performance of an artificial 
intelligence (AI)-based ILR-ECG Analyzer™ (ILR-ECG-A). This machine-learning 
algorithm reclassifies ICM-transmitted events to minimize the rate of FP 
diagnoses, while preserving device sensitivity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 546 recipients of ICM followed by the 
Implicity™ monitoring platform. To avoid clusterization, a single episode per 
ICM abnormal diagnosis (e.g. asystole, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia 
(AT)/atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia, artefact) was selected 
per patient, and analyzed by the ILR-ECG-A, applying the same diagnoses as the 
ICM. All episodes were reviewed by an adjudication committee (AC) and the 
results were compared. Among 879 episodes classified as abnormal by the ICM, 80 
(9.1%) were adjudicated as 'Artefacts', 283 (32.2%) as FP, and 516 (58.7%) as 
'abnormal' by the AC. The algorithm reclassified 215 of the 283 FP as normal 
(76.0%), and confirmed 509 of the 516 episodes as abnormal (98.6%). Seven 
undiagnosed false negatives were adjudicated as AT or non-specific abnormality. 
The overall diagnostic specificity was 76.0% and the sensitivity was 98.6%.
CONCLUSION: The new AI-based ILR-ECG-A lowered the rate of FP ICM diagnoses 
significantly while retaining a > 98% sensitivity. This will likely alleviate 
considerably the clinical burden represented by the review of ICM events.

To improve the detection of COVID-19, this paper researches and proposes an 
effective swarm intelligence algorithm-driven multi-threshold image segmentation 
(MTIS) method. First, this paper proposes a novel RIME structure integrating the 
Co-adaptive hunting and dispersed foraging strategies, called CDRIME. 
Specifically, the Co-adaptive hunting strategy works in coordination with the 
basic search rules of RIME at the individual level, which not only facilitates 
the algorithm to explore the global optimal solution but also enriches the 
population diversity to a certain extent. The dispersed foraging strategy 
further enriches the population diversity to help the algorithm break the 
limitation of local search and thus obtain better convergence. Then, on this 
basis, a new multi-threshold image segmentation method is proposed by combining 
the 2D non-local histogram with 2D Kapur entropy, called CDRIME-MTIS. Finally, 
the results of experiments based on IEEE CEC2017, IEEE CEC2019, and IEEE CEC2022 
demonstrate that CDRIME has superior performance than some other basic, 
advanced, and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of global search, convergence 
performance, and escape from local optimality. Meanwhile, the segmentation 
experiments on COVID-19 X-ray images demonstrate that CDRIME is more 
advantageous than RIME and other peers in terms of segmentation effect and 
adaptability to different threshold levels. In conclusion, the proposed CDRIME 
significantly enhances the global optimization performance and image 
segmentation of RIME and has great potential to improve COVID-19 diagnosis.

Osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) are a significant health concern linked 
to increased morbidity, mortality, and diminished quality of life. Traditional 
OVF risk assessment tools like bone mineral density (BMD) only capture a 
fraction of the risk profile. Artificial intelligence, specifically computer 
vision, has revolutionized other fields of medicine through analysis of videos, 
histopathology slides and radiological scans. In this review, we provide an 
overview of computer vision algorithms and current computer vision models used 
in predicting OVF risk. We highlight the clinical applications, future 
directions and limitations of computer vision in OVF risk prediction.

With the development of artificial intelligence and the further deepening of 
medical-engineering integration, spine surgical robot-assisted (RA) technique 
has made significant progress and its applicability in clinical practice is 
constantly expanding in recent years. In this review, we have systematically 
summarized the majority of literature related to spine surgical robots in the 
past decade, and not only classified robots accordingly, but also summarized the 
latest research progress in RA technique for screw placement such as cervical, 
thoracic, and lumbar pedicle screws, cortical bone trajectory screws, cervical 
lateral mass screws, and S2 sacroiliac screws; guiding targeted puncture and 
placement of endoscope via the intervertebral foramen; complete resection of 
spinal tumor tissue; and decompressive laminectomy. In addition, this report 
also provides a detailed evaluation of RA technique's advantages and 
disadvantages, and clarifies the accuracy, safety, and practicality of RA 
technique. We consider that this review can help clinical physicians further 
understand and familiarize the current clinical application status of spine 
surgical robots, thereby promoting the continuous improvement and popularization 
of RA technique, and ultimately benefiting numerous patients.

PURPOSE: In this paper, we present the development of a monitoring system 
designed to aid in the management and prevention of conditions related to 
urination. The system features an artificial intelligence (AI)-based recognition 
technology that automatically records a user's urination activity. Additionally, 
we developed a technology that analyzes movements to prevent neurogenic bladder.
METHODS: Our approach included the creation of AI-based recognition technology 
that automatically logs users' urination activities, as well as the development 
of technology that analyzes movements to prevent neurogenic bladder. Initially, 
we employed a recurrent neural network model for the urination activity 
recognition technology. For predicting the risk of neurogenic bladder, we 
utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AI technology.
RESULTS: The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using a study 
population of 30 patients with urinary tract dysfunction, who collected data 
over a 60-day period. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.2% in 
recognizing urinary tract activity, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the 
recognition technology. Furthermore, the motion analysis technology for 
preventing neurogenic bladder, which also employed CNN-based AI, showed 
promising results with an average accuracy of 83%.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a urination disease monitoring system 
aimed at predicting and managing risks for patients with urination issues. The 
system is designed to support the entire care cycle of a patient by leveraging 
AI technology that processes various image and signal data. We anticipate that 
this system will evolve into digital treatment products, ultimately providing 
therapeutic benefits to patients.

AIM: A high level of directly measured small dense low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (sdLDL-C) is a strong risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease. A method for estimating sdLDL-C by using Sampson's equation that 
includes levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), non-HDL-C and triglycerides (TG) has recently been proposed. We 
investigated the validation and exploration of estimated sdLDL-C level.
METHODS: The associations between measured and estimated sdLDL-C levels were 
investigated in 605 Japanese subjects (men/women: 280/325; mean age: 65±15 
years) who received annual health check-ups in the Tanno Sobetsu Study, a 
population-based cohort.
RESULTS: Estimated sdLDL-C level was highly correlated with measured sdLDL-C 
level in all subjects (R2 =0.701), nondiabetic subjects without any medication 
(n=254, R 2=0.686) and subjects with diabetes mellitus (n=128, R2=0.721). 
Multivariable regression analysis showed that levels of non-HDL-C, TG and 
γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGTP) were independent predictors of measured sdLDL-C 
level. In a stratification of the LDL window, all of the subjects with a 
combination of high non-HDL-C (≥ 170 mg/dL) and high TG (≥ 150 mg/dL) had high 
levels of measured and estimated sdLDL-C (≥ 35 mg/dL). Furthermore, machine 
learning-based estimation of sdLDL-C level by artificial intelligence software, 
Prediction One, was substantially improved by using components of Sampson's 
equation (R2=0.803) and by using those components with the addition of γGTP and 
deletion of TC (R2=0.929).
CONCLUSIONS: sdLDL-C level estimated by Sampson's equation can be used instead 
of measured sdLDL-C level in general practice. By building multiple machine 
learning models of artificial intelligence, a more accurate and practical 
estimation of sdLDL-C level might be possible.

Exploring microbial stress responses to drugs is crucial for the advancement of 
new therapeutic methods. While current artificial intelligence methodologies 
have expedited our understanding of potential microbial responses to drugs, the 
models are constrained by the imprecise representation of microbes and drugs. To 
this end, we combine deep autoencoder and subgraph augmentation technology for 
the first time to propose a model called JDASA-MRD, which can identify the 
potential indistinguishable responses of microbes to drugs. In the JDASA-MRD 
model, we begin by feeding the established similarity matrices of microbe and 
drug into the deep autoencoder, enabling to extract robust initial features of 
both microbes and drugs. Subsequently, we employ the MinHash and HyperLogLog 
algorithms to account intersections and cardinality data between microbe and 
drug subgraphs, thus deeply extracting the multi-hop neighborhood information of 
nodes. Finally, by integrating the initial node features with subgraph 
topological information, we leverage graph neural network technology to predict 
the microbes' responses to drugs, offering a more effective solution to the 
'over-smoothing' challenge. Comparative analyses on multiple public datasets 
confirm that the JDASA-MRD model's performance surpasses that of current 
state-of-the-art models. This research aims to offer a more profound insight 
into the adaptability of microbes to drugs and to furnish pivotal guidance for 
drug treatment strategies. Our data and code are publicly available at:

Protein loops play a critical role in the dynamics of proteins and are essential 
for numerous biological functions, and various computational approaches to loop 
modeling have been proposed over the past decades. However, a comprehensive 
understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method is lacking. In this 
work, we constructed two high-quality datasets (i.e. the General dataset and the 
CASP dataset) and systematically evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of 13 
commonly used loop modeling approaches from the perspective of loop lengths, 
protein classes and residue types. The results indicate that the knowledge-based 
method FREAD generally outperforms the other tested programs in most cases, but 
encountered challenges when predicting loops longer than 15 and 30 residues on 
the CASP and General datasets, respectively. The ab initio method Rosetta NGK 
demonstrated exceptional modeling accuracy for short loops with four to eight 
residues and achieved the highest success rate on the CASP dataset. The 
well-known AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold require more resources for better 
performance, but they exhibit promise for predicting loops longer than 16 and 30 
residues in the CASP and General datasets. These observations can provide 
valuable insights for selecting suitable methods for specific loop modeling 
tasks and contribute to future advancements in the field.

To date, the bulk of research on place and crime has concentrated on crime scene 
locations and home addresses of both victims and perpetrators. Beyond these 
locations, less is known about where offenders can be found during regular, 
non-criminal activity. These 'non-crime locations' provide information about 
offenders' lifestyles, their relationships with co-offenders, their preferred 
spots, and the places beyond the spatiotemporal boundaries of the crime where 
they may plan, manage, or deal with the aftermath of their behaviour. Yet there 
is a lack of systematic evidence, with the available research relying on local 
ethnographic designs, small samples or both, as access to such data was limited. 
This study utilises a novel approach by relying on the professional experience 
of intelligence police officers assigned to deal with serious and organised 
crime in the West Midlands County of the United Kingdom to determine the 
whereabouts of three types of non-crime locations: (a) hangout spots, (b) 
recruitment spots and (c) contraband hideout spots. Results suggest that 
offenders frequently visit gyms, specific restaurants, or private residences 
(not unlike locations where normative people hang out), and new members can be 
recruited anywhere. Drugs and firearms are strategically hidden near vulnerable 
persons. According to police officers, offenders are unconcerned by surveillance 
in these spots and choose venues not usually owned by criminal groups. 
Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), 
particularly the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative 
Pretrained Transformers (GPTs), has revolutionized numerous fields. The purpose 
of this study is to investigate the application of LLMs within the realm of 
orthopaedic in training examinations.
METHODS: Questions from the 2020-2022 Orthopaedic In-Service Training Exams 
(OITEs) were given to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 LLMs, using a zero-shot 
inference approach. Each model was given a multiple-choice question, without 
prior exposure to similar queries, and their generated responses were compared 
to the correct answer within each OITE. The models were evaluated on overall 
accuracy, performance on questions with and without media, and performance on 
first- and higher-order questions.
RESULTS: The GPT-4 model outperformed the GPT-3.5 Turbo model across all years 
and question categories (2022: 67.63% vs. 50.24%; 2021: 58.69% vs. 47.42%; 2020: 
59.53% vs. 46.51%). Both models showcased better performance with questions 
devoid of associated media, with GPT-4 attaining accuracies of 68.80%, 65.14%, 
and 68.22% for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. GPT-4 outscored GPT-3.5 Turbo 
on first-order questions across all years (2022: 63.83% vs. 38.30%; 2021: 57.45% 
vs. 50.00%; 2020: 65.74% vs. 53.70%). GPT-4 also outscored GPT-3.5 Turbo on 
higher-order questions across all years (2022: 68.75% vs. 53.75%; 2021: 59.66% 
vs. 45.38%; 2020: 53.27% vs. 39.25%).
DISCUSSION: GPT-4 showed improved performance compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo in all 
tested categories. The results reflect the potential and limitations of AI in 
orthopaedics. GPT-4's performance is comparable to a second-to-third-year 
resident and GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance is comparable to a first-year resident, 
suggesting the application of current LLMs can neither pass the OITE nor 
substitute orthopaedic training. This study sets a precedent for future 
endeavors integrating GPT models into orthopaedic education and underlines the 
necessity for specialized training of these models for specific medical domains.

Early diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) 
is essential to initiate timely interventions, such as medication and lifestyle 
changes, preventing irreversible joint damage, reducing symptoms, and improving 
long-term outcomes for patients. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
wrist and hand, in case of RA and MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) in case of 
axSpA can identify inflammation before it is clinically discernible, this 
modality may be crucial for early diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
techniques, together with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have 
quickly evolved in the medical field, having an important role in improving 
diagnosis, prognosis, in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and 
monitoring the activity of rheumatic diseases through MRI. The improvements of 
AI techniques in the last years regarding imaging interpretation have 
demonstrated that a computer-based analysis can equal and even exceed the human 
eye. The studies in the field of AI have investigated how specific algorithms 
could distinguish between tissues, diagnose rheumatic pathology and grade 
different signs of early inflammation, all of them being crucial for tracking 
disease activity. The aim of this paper is to highlight the implementation of AI 
models in MRI with focus on diagnosis of RA and axSpA through a literature 
review.

Libraries.

OBJECTIVE: At the forefront of machine learning research since its inception has 
been natural language processing, also known as text mining, referring to a wide 
range of statistical processes for analyzing textual data and retrieving 
information. In medical fields, text mining has made valuable contributions in 
unexpected ways, not least by synthesizing data from disparate biomedical 
studies. This rapid scoping review examines how machine learning methods for 
text mining can be implemented at the intersection of these disparate fields to 
improve the workflow and process of conducting systematic reviews in medical 
research and related academic disciplines.
METHODS: The primary research question that this investigation asked, "what 
impact does the use of machine learning have on the methods used by systematic 
review teams to carry out the systematic review process, such as the precision 
of search strategies, unbiased article selection or data abstraction and/or 
analysis for systematic reviews and other comprehensive review types of similar 
methodology?" A literature search was conducted by a medical librarian utilizing 
multiple databases, a grey literature search and handsearching of the 
literature. The search was completed on December 4, 2020. Handsearching was done 
on an ongoing basis with an end date of April 14, 2023.
RESULTS: The search yielded 23,190 studies after duplicates were removed. As a 
result, 117 studies (1.70%) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this rapid 
scoping review.
CONCLUSIONS: There are several techniques and/or types of machine learning 
methods in development or that have already been fully developed to assist with 
the systematic review stages. Combined with human intelligence, these machine 
learning methods and tools provide promise for making the systematic review 
process more efficient, saving valuable time for systematic review authors, and 
increasing the speed in which evidence can be created and placed in the hands of 
decision makers and the public.

PURPOSE: The objective of this scoping review was to investigate the 
applicability and performance of various convolutional neural network (CNN) 
models in tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs, achieved through 
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online search was performed of the PubMed, Science 
Direct, and Scopus databases. Based on the selection process, 12 studies were 
included in this review.
RESULTS: Eleven studies utilized a CNN model for detection tasks, 5 for 
classification tasks, and 3 for segmentation tasks in the context of tooth 
numbering on panoramic radiographs. Most of these studies revealed high 
performance of various CNN models in automating tooth numbering. However, 
several studies also highlighted limitations of CNNs, such as the presence of 
false positives and false negatives in identifying decayed teeth, teeth with 
crown prosthetics, teeth adjacent to edentulous areas, dental implants, root 
remnants, wisdom teeth, and root canal-treated teeth. These limitations can be 
overcome by ensuring both the quality and quantity of datasets, as well as 
optimizing the CNN architecture.
CONCLUSION: CNNs have demonstrated high performance in automated tooth numbering 
on panoramic radiographs. Future development of CNN-based models for this 
purpose should also consider different stages of dentition, such as the primary 
and mixed dentition stages, as well as the presence of various tooth conditions. 
Ultimately, an optimized CNN architecture can serve as the foundation for an 
automated tooth numbering system and for further artificial intelligence 
research on panoramic radiographs for a variety of purposes.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of aerobic exercise (AE) and lipid profiles among 
individuals with spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D) is critical for 
cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk estimation.
OBJECTIVES: To utilize an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for extracting 
indicator data and education tools to enable routine CMD indicator data 
collection in inpatient/outpatient settings, and to describe and evaluate the 
recall of AE levels and lipid profile assessment completion rates across care 
settings among adults with subacute and chronic SCI/D.
METHODS: A cross-sectional convenience sample of patients affiliated with 
University Health Network's SCI/D rehabilitation program and outpatients 
affiliated with SCI Ontario participated. The SCI-HIGH CMD intermediary outcome 
(IO) and final outcome (FO) indicator surveys were administered, using an AI 
tool to extract responses. Practice gaps were prospectively identified, and 
implementation tools were created to address gaps. Univariate and bivariate 
descriptive analyses were used.
RESULTS: The AI tool had <2% error rate for data extraction. Adults with SCI/D 
(n = 251; 124 IO, mean age 61; 127 FO, mean age 55; p = .004) completed the 
surveys. Fourteen percent of inpatients versus 48% of outpatients reported being 
taught AE. Fifteen percent of inpatients and 51% of outpatients recalled a lipid 
assessment (p < .01). Algorithms and education tools were developed to address 
identified knowledge gaps in patient AE and lipid assessments.
CONCLUSION: Compelling CMD health service gaps warrant immediate attention to 
achieve AE and lipid assessment guideline adherence. AI indicator extraction 
paired with implementation tools may facilitate indicator deployment and modify 
CMD risk.

The shortage of deceased donor organs has prompted the development of 
alternative liver grafts for transplantation. Living-donor liver transplantation 
(LDLT) has emerged as a viable option, expanding the donor pool and enabling 
timely transplantation with favorable graft function and improved long-term 
outcomes. An accurate evaluation of the donor liver's volumetry (LV) and 
anatomical study is crucial to ensure adequate future liver remnant, graft 
volume and precise liver resection. Thus, ensuring donor safety and an 
appropriate graft-to-recipient weight ratio. Manual LV (MLV) using computed 
tomography has traditionally been considered the gold standard for assessing 
liver volume. However, the method has been limited by cost, subjectivity, and 
variability. Automated LV techniques employing advanced segmentation algorithms 
offer improved reproducibility, reduced variability, and enhanced efficiency 
compared to manual measurements. However, the accuracy of automated LV requires 
further investigation. The study provides a comprehensive review of traditional 
and emerging LV methods, including semi-automated image processing, automated LV 
techniques, and machine learning-based approaches. Additionally, the study 
discusses the respective strengths and weaknesses of each of the aforementioned 
techniques. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including 
machine learning and deep learning, is expected to become a routine part of 
surgical planning in the near future. The implementation of AI is expected to 
enable faster and more accurate image study interpretations, improve workflow 
efficiency, and enhance the safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of the 
procedures. Accurate preoperative assessment of the liver plays a crucial role 
in ensuring safe donor selection and improved outcomes in LDLT. MLV has inherent 
limitations that have led to the adoption of semi-automated and automated 
software solutions. Moreover, AI has tremendous potential for LV and 
segmentation; however, its widespread use is hindered by cost and availability. 
Therefore, the integration of multiple specialties is necessary to embrace 
technology and explore its possibilities, ranging from patient counseling to 
intraoperative decision-making through automation and AI.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the medical 
field, as advanced tools powered by large language models (LLMs) make their way 
into clinical practice, research, and education. Chatbots, which can generate 
human-like responses, have gained attention for their potential applications. 
Therefore, familiarity with LLMs and other promising generative AI tools is 
crucial to harness their potential safely and effectively. As these AI-based 
technologies continue to evolve, medical professionals must develop a strong 
understanding of AI terminologies and concepts, particularly generative AI, to 
effectively tackle real-world challenges and create solutions. This knowledge 
will enable healthcare professionals to utilize AI-driven innovations for 
improved patient care and increased productivity in the future. In this brief 
technical report, we explore 20 of the most relevant terminology associated with 
the underlying technology behind LLMs and generative AI as they relate to the 
medical field and provide some examples of how these topics relate to healthcare 
applications to help in their understanding.

Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND.

This review explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
anesthesia, examining its transformative impact on patient care across various 
phases. Beginning with a historical overview of anesthesia, we highlight the 
critical role of technological advancements in ensuring optimal patient 
outcomes. The emergence of AI in healthcare sets the stage for a comprehensive 
analysis of its applications in anesthesia. In the preoperative phase, AI 
facilitates personalized risk assessments and decision support, optimizing 
anesthesia planning and drug dosage predictions. Moving to the intraoperative 
phase, we delve into AI's role in monitoring and control through sophisticated 
anesthesia monitoring and closed-loop systems. Additionally, we discuss the 
integration of robotics and AI-guided procedures, revolutionizing surgical 
assistance. Transitioning to the postoperative phase, we explore AI-driven 
postoperative monitoring, predictive analysis for complications, and the 
integration of AI into rehabilitation programs and long-term follow-up. These 
new applications redefine patient recovery, emphasizing personalized care and 
proactive interventions. However, the integration of AI in anesthesia poses 
challenges and ethical considerations. Data security, interpretability, and bias 
in AI algorithms demand scrutiny. Moreover, the evolving patient-doctor 
relationship in an AI-driven care landscape requires a delicate balance between 
efficiency and human touch. Looking forward, we discuss the future directions of 
AI in anesthesia, anticipating advances in technology and AI algorithms. The 
integration of AI into routine clinical practice and its potential impact on 
anesthesia education and training are explored, emphasizing the need for 
collaboration, education, and ethical guidelines. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of AI applications in anesthesia, offering insights into 
the present landscape, challenges, and future directions. The synthesis of 
historical perspectives, current applications, and future possibilities 
underscores the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing patient care 
within the dynamic field of anesthesia.

We investigated the potential of ChatGPT in the ophthalmological field in the 
Japanese language using board examinations for specialists in the Japanese 
Ophthalmology Society. We tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4-based ChatGPT on five sets of 
past board examination problems in July 2023. Japanese text was used as the 
prompt adopting two strategies: zero- and few-shot prompting. We compared the 
correct answer rate of ChatGPT with that of actual examinees, and the 
performance characteristics in 10 subspecialties were assessed. ChatGPT-3.5 and 
ChatGPT-4 correctly answered 112 (22.4%) and 229 (45.8%) out of 500 questions 
with simple zero-shot prompting, respectively, and ChatGPT-4 correctly answered 
231 (46.2%) questions with few-shot prompting. The correct answer rates of 
ChatGPT-3.5 were approximately two to three times lower than those of the actual 
examinees for each examination set (p = 0.001). However, the correct answer 
rates for ChatGPT-4 were close to approximately 70% of those of the examinees. 
ChatGPT-4 had the highest correct answer rate (71.4% with zero-shot prompting 
and 61.9% with few-shot prompting) in "blepharoplasty, orbit, and ocular 
oncology," and the lowest answer rate (30.0% with zero-shot prompting and 23.3% 
with few-shot prompting) in "pediatric ophthalmology." We concluded that ChatGPT 
could be one of the advanced technologies for practical tools in Japanese 
ophthalmology.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging modality in clinics 
for medical disease diagnosis, staging, and follow-up. Deep learning has been 
extensively used to accelerate k-space data acquisition, enhance MR image 
reconstruction, and automate tissue segmentation. However, these three tasks are 
usually treated as independent tasks and optimized for evaluation by 
radiologists, thus ignoring the strong dependencies among them; this may be 
suboptimal for downstream intelligent processing. Here, we present a novel 
paradigm, full-stack learning (FSL), which can simultaneously solve these three 
tasks by considering the overall imaging process and leverage the strong 
dependence among them to further improve each task, significantly boosting the 
efficiency and efficacy of practical MRI workflows. Experimental results 
obtained on multiple open MR datasets validate the superiority of FSL over 
existing state-of-the-art methods on each task. FSL has great potential to 
optimize the practical workflow of MRI for medical diagnosis and radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence which suggests the utility of artificial 
intelligence (AI) in the diagnostic assessment and pre-treatment evaluation of 
thyroid eye disease (TED). This scoping review aims to (1) identify the extent 
of the available evidence (2) provide an in-depth analysis of AI research 
methodology of the studies included in the review (3) Identify knowledge gaps 
pertaining to research in this area.
METHODS: This review was performed according to the 2020 Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). We quantify 
the diagnostic accuracy of AI models in the field of TED assessment and appraise 
the quality of these studies using the modified QUADAS-2 tool.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were included in this review. The most common AI 
models used in these studies are convolutional neural networks (CNN). The 
majority of the studies compared algorithm performance against healthcare 
professionals. The overall risk of bias and applicability using the modified 
Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool led to most 
of the studies being classified as low risk, although higher deficiency was 
noted in the risk of bias in flow and timing.
CONCLUSIONS: While the results of the review showed high diagnostic accuracy of 
the AI models in identifying features of TED relevant to disease assessment, 
deficiencies in study design causing study bias and compromising study 
applicability were noted. Moving forward, limitations and challenges inherent to 
machine learning should be addressed with improved standardized guidance around 
study design, reporting, and legislative framework.

[Artificial neural networks as a psychiatric instrument].

[Article in Dutch]

Mertens L, Vennekens J, Op de Beeck H, Yargholi E, Van den Stock J.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved enormously over the past 
decade and is increasingly being applied to a range of domains, including 
psychiatry. AI encompasses several modalities, including artificial neural 
networks (ANNs), referring to computer models partly based on the workings of 
the brain. ANNs have existed since the &rsquo;50s, but only became 
&lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; since the 2010s. The fact that they are inspired by the 
workings of the brain raises the question of whether they can also be used to 
model the (dys)functioning of the brain. This question led to the advent of the 
research field &lsquo;computational psychiatry&rsquo;.
AIM: This article aims at providing an accessible introduction to artificial 
neural networks, and potential applications hereof in contemporary psychiatric 
practice.
METHOD: Literature review with some examples.
RESULTS: In this article we try to outline with some concrete examples what 
artificial neural networks are and how they can be used to model mechanisms in 
the brain. We successively discuss ANNs as a model of the human visual system, 
as a model of prosopagnosia and as a model of auditory hallucinations and 
finally as a model of autism spectrum disorder. We also describe a number of 
limitations of this approach.
CONCLUSION: A computer model that models the entire brain is challenging at 
present, but current models can help in testing hypotheses concerning possible 
mechanisms that give rise to a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions.

To improve and even reverse sarcopenia in elderly people, this study developed a 
self-determined sequence exercise program consisting of strength training 
exercise, Yijinjing exercise (a traditional Chinese exercise), and hybrid 
strength training with Yijinjing exercise. Ninety-four community-dwelling older 
adults screened for sarcopenia using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 
criteria were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of a control group (CG, n = 30), 
self-determined sequence exercise program group (SDSG, n = 34) or strength 
training group (STG, n = 30). The study examined the effects of three 
interventions on participantsL3 skeletal muscle fat density, L3 skeletal muscle 
fat area, L3 skeletal muscle density, L3 skeletal muscle area, muscle fat 
infiltration, relative skeletal muscle mass index, and grip strength using a 
repeated-measures ANOVA to evaluate the experimental data. To evaluate the real 
effect of this model in reversing sarcopenia after the intervention, nine 
classification models were trained. Significant interaction effects were 
observed with grip strength, RSMI, L3 SMD, and L3 SMA. At the 24th week, 
participants' grip strength, L3 SMFA, L3 SMA, and RSMI were improved 
significantly in the SDSG and STG. The SDSG achieved significantly greater RSMI 
and grip strength than the STG and CG after the intervention. The 
self-determined sequence exercise program exhibited better performance than the 
single type of exercise modality in reversing sarcopenia and improving older 
adults' skeletal muscle area. Consequently, the stacking model is feasible to 
make a prediction as to whether or not sarcopenia may be reversed in older 
adults.

The key components dominating the quality of green tea and black tea are still 
unclear. Here, we respectively produced green and black teas in March and June, 
and investigated the correlations between sensory quality and chemical 
compositions of dry teas by multivariate statistics, bioinformatics and 
artificial intelligence algorithm. The key chemical indices were screened out to 
establish tea sensory quality-prediction models based on the result of OPLS-DA 
and random forest, namely 4 flavonol glycosides of green tea and 8 indices of 
black tea (4 pigments, epigallocatechin, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside, 
ratios of caffeine/total catechins and epi/non-epi catechins). Compared with 
OPLS-DA and random forest, the support vector machine model had good sensory 
quality-prediction performance for both green tea and black tea 
(F1-score > 0.92), even based on the indices of fresh tea leaves. Our study 
explores the potential of artificial intelligence algorithm in classification 
and prediction of tea products with different sensory quality.

BACKGROUND: Temporal phenotyping of patient journeys, which capture the common 
sequence patterns of interventions in the treatment of a specific condition, is 
useful to support understanding of antimicrobial usage in veterinary patients. 
Identifying and describing these phenotypes can inform antimicrobial stewardship 
programs designed to fight antimicrobial resistance, a major health crisis 
affecting both humans and animals, in which veterinarians have an important role 
to play.
OBJECTIVE: This research proposes a framework for extracting temporal phenotypes 
of patient journeys from clinical practice data through the application of 
natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised machine learning (ML) 
techniques, using cat bite abscesses as a model condition. By constructing 
temporal phenotypes from key events, the relationship between antimicrobial 
administration and surgical interventions can be described, and similar 
treatment patterns can be grouped together to describe outcomes associated with 
specific antimicrobial selection.
METHODS: Cases identified as having a cat bite abscess as a diagnosis were 
extracted from VetCompass Australia, a database of veterinary clinical records. 
A classifier was trained and used to label the most clinically relevant event 
features in each record as chosen by a group of veterinarians. The labeled 
records were processed into coded character strings, where each letter 
represents a summary of specific types of treatments performed at a given visit. 
The sequences of letters representing the cases were clustered based on weighted 
Levenshtein edit distances with KMeans+ + to identify the main variations of the 
patient treatment journeys, including the antimicrobials used and their duration 
of administration.
RESULTS: A total of 13,744 records that met the selection criteria was extracted 
and grouped into 8436 cases. There were 9 clinically distinct event sequence 
patterns (temporal phenotypes) of patient journeys identified, representing the 
main sequences in which surgery and antimicrobial interventions are performed. 
Patients receiving amoxicillin and surgery had the shortest duration of 
antimicrobial administration (median of 3.4 days) and patients receiving 
cefovecin with no surgical intervention had the longest antimicrobial treatment 
duration (median of 27 days).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates methods to extract and provide an overview of 
temporal phenotypes of patient journeys, which can be applied to text-based 
clinical records for multiple species or clinical conditions. We demonstrate the 
effectiveness of this approach to derive real-world evidence of treatment 
impacts using cat bite abscesses as a model condition to describe patterns of 
antimicrobial therapy prescriptions and their outcomes.

Quantum computing promises to enhance machine learning and artificial 
intelligence. However, recent theoretical works show that, similar to 
traditional classifiers based on deep classical neural networks, quantum 
classifiers would suffer from adversarial perturbations as well. Here we report 
an experimental demonstration of quantum adversarial learning with programmable 
superconducting qubits. We train quantum classifiers, which are built on 
variational quantum circuits consisting of ten transmon qubits featuring average 
lifetimes of 150 μs, and average fidelities of simultaneous single- and 
two-qubit gates above 99.94% and 99.4%, respectively, with both real-life images 
(for example, medical magnetic resonance imaging scans) and quantum data. We 
demonstrate that these well-trained classifiers (with testing accuracy up to 
99%) can be practically deceived by small adversarial perturbations, whereas an 
adversarial training process would substantially enhance their robustness to 
such perturbations.

Extreme events in society and nature, such as pandemic spikes, rogue waves or 
structural failures, can have catastrophic consequences. Characterizing extremes 
is difficult, as they occur rarely, arise from seemingly benign conditions, and 
belong to complex and often unknown infinite-dimensional systems. Such 
challenges render attempts at characterizing them moot. We address each of these 
difficulties by combining output-weighted training schemes in Bayesian 
experimental design (BED) with an ensemble of deep neural operators. This 
model-agnostic framework pairs a BED scheme that actively selects data for 
quantifying extreme events with an ensemble of deep neural operators that 
approximate infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators. We show that not only does 
this framework outperform Gaussian processes, but that (1) shallow ensembles of 
just two members perform best; (2) extremes are uncovered regardless of the 
state of the initial data (that is, with or without extremes); (3) our method 
eliminates 'double-descent' phenomena; (4) the use of batches of suboptimal 
acquisition samples compared to step-by-step global optima does not hinder BED 
performance; and (5) Monte Carlo acquisition outperforms standard optimizers in 
high dimensions. Together, these conclusions form a scalable artificial 
intelligence (AI)-assisted experimental infrastructure that can efficiently 
infer and pinpoint critical situations across many domains, from physical to 
societal systems.

Effective spatial planning of urban communities plays a critical role in the 
sustainable development of cities. Despite the convenience brought by geographic 
information systems and computer-aided design, determining the layout of land 
use and roads still heavily relies on human experts. Here we propose an 
artificial intelligence urban-planning model to generate spatial plans for urban 
communities. To overcome the difficulty of diverse and irregular urban 
geography, we construct a graph to describe the topology of cities in arbitrary 
forms and formulate urban planning as a sequential decision-making problem on 
the graph. To tackle the challenge of the vast solution space, we develop a 
reinforcement learning model based on graph neural networks. Experiments on both 
synthetic and real-world communities demonstrate that our computational model 
outperforms plans designed by human experts in objective metrics and that it can 
generate spatial plans responding to different circumstances and needs. We also 
propose a human-artificial intelligence collaborative workflow of urban 
planning, in which human designers can substantially benefit from our model to 
be more productive, generating more efficient spatial plans with much less time. 
Our method demonstrates the great potential of computational urban planning and 
paves the way for more explorations in leveraging computational methodologies to 
solve challenging real-world problems in urban science.

In the coming decades, we will face major computational challenges, when the 
improved sensitivity of third-generation gravitational wave detectors will be 
such that they will be able to detect a high number (of the order of 7 × 104 per 
year) of multi-messenger events from binary neutron star mergers, similar to 
GW 170817. In this Perspective, we discuss the application of multimodal 
artificial intelligence techniques for multi-messenger astrophysics, fusing the 
information from different signal emissions.

All physical laws are described as mathematical relationships between state 
variables. These variables give a complete and non-redundant description of the 
relevant system. However, despite the prevalence of computing power and 
artificial intelligence, the process of identifying the hidden state variables 
themselves has resisted automation. Most data-driven methods for modelling 
physical phenomena still rely on the assumption that the relevant state 
variables are already known. A longstanding question is whether it is possible 
to identify state variables from only high-dimensional observational data. Here 
we propose a principle for determining how many state variables an observed 
system is likely to have, and what these variables might be. We demonstrate the 
effectiveness of this approach using video recordings of a variety of physical 
dynamical systems, ranging from elastic double pendulums to fire flames. Without 
any prior knowledge of the underlying physics, our algorithm discovers the 
intrinsic dimension of the observed dynamics and identifies candidate sets of 
state variables.

The chemical space for designing materials is practically infinite. This makes 
disruptive progress by traditional physics-based modeling alone challenging. 
Yet, training data for identifying composition-structure-property relations by 
artificial intelligence are sparse. We discuss opportunities to discover new 
chemically complex materials by hybrid methods where physics laws are combined 
with artificial intelligence.

Frequency modulation of terahertz microcavity via strong coupling with plasmonic 
resonators.

Xu X, Lu Y, Huang Y, Zhou X, Ma R, Xiong H, Li M, Wu Q, Xu J.

Tunable terahertz (THz) microcavities are crucial for the compact on-chip THz 
devices, aiming to future cloud-based computing, and artificial-intelligence 
technologies. However, the solutions to effectively modulate THz microcavities 
remain elusive. Strong coupling has been widely demonstrated in many 
configurations at different ambient conditions to date and may serve as a 
promising tool to modulate THz microcavities. Here, we schematically design a 
microcavity-plasmon hybrid system, and propose an effective approach to 
modulating the resonant frequencies of THz microcavities by the 
microcavity-resonator strong coupling. In this case, we observed the strongly 
coupling states, where the resultant two-polariton branches exhibit an 
anti-crossing splitting in the frequency domain, experimentally exhibiting a 
∼6.2% frequency modulation to the microcavity compared to the uncoupled case. 
This work provides an efficient approach to modulating chip-scale THz 
microcavities, thereby facilitating the development and application of compact 
THz integrated devices, further empowering the evolution of future information 
processing and intelligent computing system.

Modern artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction methods, such 
as Alphafold2, can predict structures of folded proteins with reasonable 
accuracy. However, Alphafold2 provides a static view of a protein, which does 
not show the conformational variability of the protein, domain movement in a 
multi-domain protein, or ligand-induced conformational changes it might undergo 
in solution. Small-angle X-ay scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering 
(WAXS) are solution techniques that can aid in integrative modeling of 
conformationally flexible proteins, or in validating their predicted ensemble 
structures. While SAXS is sensitive to global structural features, WAXS can 
expand the scope of structural modeling by including information about local 
structural changes. We present SAXS and WAXS datasets obtained from 
conformationally flexible d-ribose binding protein (RBP) from Escherichia coli 
in the ribose bound and unbound forms. SAXS/WAXS datasets of RBP provided here 
may aid in method development efforts for more accurate prediction of structural 
ensembles of conformationally flexible proteins, and their conformational 
changes.

BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common causes of intellectual 
disability. Children with DS have varying intelligence quotient (IQ) that can 
predict their learning abilities.
AIM: To assess the brain metabolic profiles of children with DS and compare them 
to standard controls, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 
correlating the results with IQ.
METHODS: This case-control study included 40 children with DS aged 6-15 years 
and 40 age and sex-matched healthy children as controls. MRS was used to 
evaluate ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), N-acetyl aspartic acid/creatine 
(NAA/Cr), and myoinositol/creatine (MI/Cr (in the frontal, temporal, and 
occipital lobes and basal ganglia and compared to controls and correlated with 
IQ.
RESULTS: Children with DS showed significant reductions in NAA/Cr and MI/Cr and 
a non-significant reduction in Cho/Cr in frontal lobes compared to controls. 
Additionally, we observed significant decreases in NAA/Cr, MI/Cr, and Cho/Cr in 
the temporal and occipital lobes and basal ganglia in children with DS compared 
to controls. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between IQ and 
metabolic ratios in the brains of children with DS.
CONCLUSION: Brain metabolic profile could be a good predictor of IQ in children 
with DS.

BACKGROUND: The sense of the quality of life is an important variable, 
especially in the context of the profession; therefore it seems essential to 
capture the variables that predict this construct. The aim of the article was to 
show how self-esteem, emotional intelligence and social competences explain the 
sense of quality of life in a group of illusionists (N = 53).
PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: The aim of the article was to show how self-esteem, 
emotional intelligence and social competences explain the sense of quality of 
life in a group of illusionists (N = 53). Moreover, the moderating role of the 
stage experience of relationships between predictors and the explained variable 
was checked. Polish tools were used in the study: the Popular Questionnaire of 
Emotional Intelligence, the Questionnaire of Social Competences and the Sense of 
Quality of Life Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Among the predictors that explained the sense of quality of life to the 
greatest extent (in the psychosocial, subjective and metaphysical spheres) were 
the acceptance of emotions and social competences. Stage experience turned out 
to be a moderator of the relation between emotional intelligence and the 
subjective sphere of the sense of quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The conducted research may constitute the basis for changing the 
approach to everyday functioning in order to improve the sense of quality of 
life.

Radiomics aims to develop novel biomarkers and provide relevant deeper subvisual 
information about pathology, immunophenotype, and tumor microenvironment. It 
uses automated or semiautomated quantitative analysis of high-dimensional images 
to improve characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis. Recent years have seen a 
rapid increase in radiomics applications in nuclear medicine, leading to some 
promising research results in digestive system oncology, which have been driven 
by big data analysis and the development of artificial intelligence. Although 
radiomics advances one step further toward the non-invasive precision medical 
analysis, it is still a step away from clinical application and faces many 
challenges. This review article summarizes the available literature on digestive 
system tumors regarding radiomics in nuclear medicine. First, we describe the 
workflow and steps involved in radiomics analysis. Subsequently, we discuss the 
progress in clinical application regarding the utilization of radiomics for 
distinguishing between various diseases and evaluating their prognosis, and 
demonstrate how radiomics advances this field. Finally, we offer our viewpoint 
on how the field can progress by addressing the challenges facing clinical 
implementation.

BACKGROUND: Missing occult cancer lesions accounts for the most diagnostic 
errors in retrospective radiology reviews as early cancer can be small or 
subtle, making the lesions difficult to detect. Second-observer is the most 
effective technique for reducing these events and can be economically 
implemented with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).
AIM: To achieve appropriate AI model training, a large annotated dataset is 
necessary to train the AI models. Our goal in this research is to compare two 
methods for decreasing the annotation time to establish ground truth: Skip-slice 
annotation and AI-initiated annotation.
METHODS: We developed a 2D U-Net as an AI second observer for detecting 
colorectal cancer (CRC) and an ensemble of 5 differently initiated 2D U-Net for 
ensemble technique. Each model was trained with 51 cases of annotated CRC 
computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, tested with 7 cases, and 
validated with 20 cases from The Cancer Imaging Archive cases. The sensitivity, 
false positives per case, and estimated Dice coefficient were obtained for each 
method of training. We compared the two methods of annotations and the time 
reduction associated with the technique. The time differences were tested using 
Friedman's two-way analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Sparse annotation significantly reduces the time for annotation 
particularly skipping 2 slices at a time (P < 0.001). Reduction of up to 2/3 of 
the annotation does not reduce AI model sensitivity or false positives per case. 
Although initializing human annotation with AI reduces the annotation time, the 
reduction is minimal, even when using an ensemble AI to decrease false 
positives.
CONCLUSION: Our data support the sparse annotation technique as an efficient 
technique for reducing the time needed to establish the ground truth.

INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronically progressive mental 
condition, associated with a reduced quality of life and greater disability. 
Patient admissions are preventable events with a considerable impact on global 
functioning and social adjustment. While machine learning (ML) approaches have 
proven prediction ability in other diseases, little is known about their utility 
to predict patient admissions in this pathology.
AIM: To develop prediction models for hospital admission/readmission within 
5 years of diagnosis in patients with BD using ML techniques.
METHODS: The study utilized data from patients diagnosed with BD in a major 
healthcare organization in Colombia. Candidate predictors were selected from 
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and included sociodemographic and clinical 
variables. ML algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic 
Regressions, and Support Vector Machines, were used to predict patient admission 
or readmission. Survival models, including a penalized Cox Model and Random 
Survival Forest, were used to predict time to admission and first readmission. 
Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and concordance 
index.
RESULTS: The admission dataset included 2,726 BD patients, with 354 admissions, 
while the readmission dataset included 352 patients, with almost half being 
readmitted. The best-performing model for predicting admission was the Random 
Forest, with an accuracy score of 0.951 and an AUC of 0.98. The variables with 
the greatest predictive power in the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) 
importance analysis were the number of psychiatric emergency visits, the number 
of outpatient follow-up appointments and age. Survival models showed similar 
results, with the Random Survival Forest performing best, achieving an AUC of 
0.95. However, the prediction models for patient readmission had poorer 
performance, with the Random Forest model being again the best performer but 
with an AUC below 0.70.
CONCLUSION: ML models, particularly the Random Forest model, outperformed 
traditional statistical techniques for admission prediction. However, 
readmission prediction models had poorer performance. This study demonstrates 
the potential of ML techniques in improving prediction accuracy for BD patient 
admissions.

PURPOSES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer 
(RNFL), choroidal layer, inner plexiform layer (IPL), and ganglion cell layer 
(GCL) in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
METHODS: In this study, we measured the thickness of the RNFL, GCL, IPL, and 
choroidal thickness using a spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT) device 
and we compared the results between the children diagnosed with ASD and healthy 
controls. Correlation between the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the 
OCT data was evaluated.
RESULTS: Both ASD and control group consisted of 40 subjects (30 males and 10 
females). Of the children in the ASD group, 29 had normal intelligence and 11 
had mild intellectual disability (MID). The mean age of patients in the ASD 
group and control groups were 9.77 ± 3.37 years and 9.85 ± 3.97 years (p = 
0.928). There was a statistically significant difference between the ASD group 
and the control group in the nasal and nasal-superior sectors of the RNFL layers 
in the left eye when all the lower layers of RNFL were assessed. In both eyes, 
the children with ASD had considerably lower mean choroidal thicknesses than the 
controls. When compared to the controls, the GCL and IPL volumes in the 
individuals with ASD were considerably lower in both eyes. Compared to the MID 
group, the left GCL volume of the nasal-inferior group was noticeably higher. A 
significant correlation was found between CARS scores and left GCL left IPL.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to RNFL in the ASD group, significant reductions in 
IPL, GCL, and choroidal thickness were observed in both eyes. It is thought that 
GCL may be a much more important biomarker than RNFL in terms of representing 
the structural deterioration in the brain. In addition, these results may form 
the basis for a new perspective on the use of OCT for the diagnosis and clinical 
course of autism.

INTRODUCTION: Dental radiographs are essential in the diagnostic process in 
dentistry. They serve various purposes, including determining age, analyzing 
patterns of tooth eruption/shedding, and treatment planning and prognosis. The 
emergence of digital radiography technology has piqued interest in using 
artificial intelligence systems to assist and guide dental professionals. These 
cutting-edge technologies assist in streamlining decision-making processes by 
enabling entity classification and localization tasks. With the integration of 
artificial Intelligence algorithms tailored for pediatric dentistry applications 
and utilizing automated tools, there is an optimistic outlook on improving 
diagnostic capabilities while reducing stress and fatigue among clinicians.
METHODOLOGY: The dataset comprised 620 images (mixed dentition: 314, permanent 
dentition: 306). Panoramic radiographs taken were within the age range of 4-16 
years. The classification of deciduous and permanent teeth involved training 
CNN-based models using different architectures such as Resnet, AlexNet, and 
EfficientNet, among others. A ratio of 70:15:15 was utilized for training, 
validation, and testing, respectively.
RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that among the models proposed, 
EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 exhibited superior performance. Both 
EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 achieved an accuracy rate, precision, recall, 
and F1 scores of 98% in classifying teeth as either deciduous or permanent. This 
implies that these models were highly accurate in identifying patterns/features 
within the dataset used for evaluation.

Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma has a favorable prognosis with a 5-year 
survival rate of over 95%. However, the undifferentiated or anaplastic type 
accounting for < 0.2%, usually in elderly individuals, exhibits a dismal 
prognosis with rapid growth and disappointing outcomes. It is the most 
aggressive form of thyroid carcinoma, with a median survival of 5 mo and poor 
quality of life (airway obstruction, dysphagia, hoarseness, persistent pain). 
Early diagnosis and staging are crucial. Diagnostic tools include biopsy (fine 
needle aspiration, core needle, open surgery), high-resolution ultrasound, 
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, [(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose 
positron emission tomo-graphy/computed tomography, liquid biopsy and microRNAs. 
The BRAF gene (BRAF-V600E and BRAF wild type) is the most often found molecular 
factor. Others include the genes RET, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. Recent management 
policy is based on surgery, even debulking, chemotherapy (cisplatin or 
doxorubicin), radiotherapy (adjuvant or definitive), targeted biological agents 
and immunotherapy. The last two options constitute novel hopeful management 
modalities improving the overall survival in these otherwise condemned patients. 
Anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody immunotherapy, stem cell targeted 
therapies, nanotechnology achievements and artificial intelligence 
imple-mentation provide novel promising alternatives. Genetic mutations 
determine molecular pathways, thus indicating novel treatment strategies such as 
anti-BRAF, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and anti-epidermal growth 
factor receptor. Treatment with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib 
and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration in cases with BRAF-V600E gene mutations and is currently the 
standard care. This neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery ensures a two-year 
overall survival of 80%. Prognostic factors for improved outcomes have been 
found to be younger age, earlier tumor stage and radiation therapy. A 
multidisciplinary approach is necessary, and the therapeutic plan should be 
individualized based on surveillance and epidemiology end results.

Background and purpose: Intellectual disability-7 (MRD7) is a subtype disorder 
of intellectual disability (MRD) involving feeding difficulties, hypoactivity, 
and febrile seizures at an age of early onset, then progressive intellectual and 
physical development deterioration. We purposed to identify the underlying 
causative genetic factors of three individuals in each Chinese family who 
presented with symptoms of intellectual disability and facial dysmorphic 
features. We provided prenatal diagnosis for the three families and genetic 
counseling for the prevention of this disease. Methods: We collected 
retrospective clinical diagnostic evidence for the three probands in our study, 
which included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), 
electroencephalogram (EEG), and intelligence tests for the three probands in our 
study. Genetic investigation of the probands and their next of kin was performed 
by Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR 
technologies were then used as the next step to verify the variants confirmed 
with Trio-WES for the three families. Moreover, we performed amniocentesis to 
explore the state of the three pathogenic variants in the fetuses by prenatal 
molecular genetic diagnosis at an appropriate gestational period for the three 
families. Results: The three probands and one fetus were clinically diagnosed 
with microcephaly and exhibited intellectual developmental disability, postnatal 
feeding difficulties, and facial dysmorphic features. Combining probands' 
clinical manifestations, Trio-WES uncovered the three heterozygous variants in 
DYRK1A: a novel variant exon3_exon4del p.(Gly4_Asn109del), a novel variant 
c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*), and a previously presented but rare pathogenic variant 
c.1309C>T p.(Arg437*) (NM_001396.5) in three families, respectively. In light of 
the updated American College of Medical Genetic and Genomics (ACMG) criterion, 
the variant of exon3_exon4del and c.1159C>T were both classified as likely 
pathogenic (PSV1+PM6), while c1309C>T was identified as pathogenic 
(PVS1+PS2_Moderate+PM2). Considering clinical features and molecular testimony, 
the three probands were confirmed diagnosed with MRD7. These three discovered 
variants were considered as the three causal mutations for MRD7. Prenatal 
diagnosis detected the heterozygous dominant variant of c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*) in 
one of the fetuses, indicating a significant probability of MRD7, subsequently 
the gestation was intervened by the parents' determination and professional 
obstetrical operation. On the other side, prenatal molecular genetic testing 
revealed wild-type alleles in the other two fetuses, and their parents both 
decided to sustain the gestation. Conclusion: We identified two novel and one 
rare mutation in DYRK1A which has broadened the spectrum of DYRK1A and provided 
evidence for the diagnosis of MRD7 at the molecular level. Besides, this study 
has supported the three families with MRD7 to determine the causative genetic 
factors efficiently and provide concise genetic counseling for the three 
families by using Trio-WES technology.

When faced with an unidentified body, identifying the victim can be challenging, 
particularly if physical characteristics are obscured or masked. In recent 
years, microbiological analysis in forensic science has emerged as a 
cutting-edge technology. It not only exhibits individual specificity, 
distinguishing different human biotraces from various sites of occurrence (e.g., 
gastrointestinal, oral, skin, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts), each 
hosting distinct bacterial species, but also offers insights into the accident's 
location and the surrounding environment. The integration of machine learning 
with microbiomics provides a substantial improvement in classifying bacterial 
species compares to traditional sequencing techniques. This review discusses the 
use of machine learning algorithms such as RF, SVM, ANN, DNN, regression, and BN 
for the detection and identification of various bacteria, including Bacillus 
anthracis, Acetobacter aceti, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus, among 
others. Deep leaning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
models and derivatives, are also employed to predict the victim's age, gender, 
lifestyle, and racial characteristics. It is anticipated that big data analytics 
and artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role in advancing forensic 
microbiology in the future.

This work explores the complex field of HER2 testing in the HER2-low breast 
cancer era, with a focus on methodological aspects. We aim to propose clear 
positions to scientific societies, institutions, pathologists, and oncologists 
to guide and shape the appropriate diagnostic strategies for HER2-low breast 
cancer. The fundamental question at hand is whether the necessary tools to 
effectively translate our knowledge about HER2 into practical diagnostic schemes 
for the lower spectrum of expression are available. Our investigation is 
centered on the significance of distinguishing between an immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) score 0 and score 1+ in light of the clinical implications now apparent, 
as patients with HER2-low breast cancer become eligible for 
trastuzumab-deruxtecan treatment. Furthermore, we discuss the definition of 
HER2-low beyond its conventional boundaries and assess the reliability of 
established diagnostic procedures designed at a time when therapeutic 
perspectives were non-existent for these cases. In this regard, we examine 
potential complementary technologies, such as gene expression analysis and 
liquid biopsy. Ultimately, we consider the potential role of artificial 
intelligence (AI) in the field of digital pathology and its integration into 
HER2 testing, with a particular emphasis on its application in the context of 
HER2-low breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of artificial intelligence-powered language 
models (ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4) compared to trainees and clinical chemists in 
responding to common laboratory questions in the broad area of Clinical 
Chemistry.
METHODS: 35 questions from real-life case scenarios, clinical consultations, and 
clinical chemistry testing questions were used to evaluate ChatGPT 3.5, and 
GPT-4 alongside clinical chemistry trainees (residents/fellows) and clinical 
chemistry faculty. The responses were scored based on category and based on 
years of experience.
RESULTS: The Senior Chemistry Faculty demonstrated superior accuracy with 100% 
of correct responses compared to 90.5%, 82.9%, and 71.4% of correct responses 
from the junior chemistry faculty, fellows, and residents respectively. They all 
outperformed both ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4 which generated 60% and 71.4% correct 
responses respectively. Of the sub-categories examined, ChatGPT 3.5 achieved 
100% accuracy in endocrinology while GPT-4 did not achieve 100% accuracy in any 
subcategory. GPT-4 was overall better than ChatGPT 3.5 by generating similar 
correct responses as residents (71.4%) but performed poorly to human 
participants when both partially correct and incorrect indices were considered.
CONCLUSION: Despite all the advances in AI-powered language models, ChatGPT 3.5 
and GPT-4 cannot replace a trained pathologist in answering clinical chemistry 
questions. Caution should be observed by people, especially those not trained in 
clinical chemistry, to interpret test results using chatbots.

Despite the great potential of deep neural networks (DNNs), they require massive 
weights and huge computational resources, creating a vast gap when deploying 
artificial intelligence at low-cost edge devices. Current lightweight DNNs, 
achieved by high-dimensional space pre-training and post-compression, present 
challenges when covering the resources deficit, making tiny artificial 
intelligence hard to be implemented. Here we report an architecture named random 
sketch learning, or Rosler, for computationally efficient tiny artificial 
intelligence. We build a universal compressing-while-training framework that 
directly learns a compact model and, most importantly, enables computationally 
efficient on-device learning. As validated on different models and datasets, it 
attains substantial memory reduction of ~50-90× (16-bits quantization), compared 
with fully connected DNNs. We demonstrate it on low-cost hardware, whereby the 
computation is accelerated by >180× and the energy consumption is reduced by 
~10×. Our method paves the way for deploying tiny artificial intelligence in 
many scientific and industrial applications.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) relies heavily on 
neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and exclusion of mimics. This 
can be a challenging task due to radiological overlap in several disorders and 
may require ancillary testing or longitudinal follow up. One of the most common 
radiological MS mimickers is non-specific white matter disease (NSWMD). We aimed 
to develop and evaluate models leveraging machine learning algorithms to help 
distinguish MS and NSWMD.
METHODS: All adult patients who underwent MRI brain using a demyelinating 
protocol with available electronic medical records between 2015 and 2019 at 
Cleveland Clinic affiliated facilities were included. Diagnosis of MS and NSWMD 
were assessed from clinical documentation. Those with a diagnosis of MS and 
NSWMD were matched using total T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and used to train models 
with logistic regression and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Performance 
metrices were reported for each model.
RESULTS: A total of 250 NSWMD MRI scans were identified, and 250 unique MS MRI 
scans were matched on T2LV. Cross validated logistic regression model was able 
to use 20 variables (including spinal cord area, regional volumes, and 
fractions) to predict MS compared to NSWMD with 68.0% accuracy while the CNN 
model was able to classify MS compared to NSWMD in two independent validation 
and testing cohorts with 77% and 78% accuracy on average.
CONCLUSION: Automated methods can be used to differentiate MS compared to NSWMD. 
These methods can be used to supplement currently available diagnostic tools for 
patients being evaluated for MS.

Pathology diagnosis based on EEG signals and decoding brain activity holds 
immense importance in understanding neurological disorders. With the advancement 
of artificial intelligence methods and machine learning techniques, the 
potential for accurate data-driven diagnoses and effective treatments has grown 
significantly. However, applying machine learning algorithms to real-world 
datasets presents diverse challenges at multiple levels. The scarcity of labeled 
data, especially in low regime scenarios with limited availability of real 
patient cohorts due to high costs of recruitment, underscores the vital 
deployment of scaling and transfer learning techniques. In this study, we 
explore a real-world pathology classification task to highlight the 
effectiveness of data and model scaling and cross-dataset knowledge transfer. As 
such, we observe varying performance improvements through data scaling, 
indicating the need for careful evaluation and labeling. Additionally, we 
identify the challenges of possible negative transfer and emphasize the 
significance of some key components to overcome distribution shifts and 
potential spurious correlations and achieve positive transfer. We see 
improvement in the performance of the target model on the target (NMT) datasets 
by using the knowledge from the source dataset (TUAB) when a low amount of 
labeled data was available. Our findings demonstrated that a small and generic 
model (e.g. ShallowNet) performs well on a single dataset, however, a larger 
model (e.g. TCN) performs better in transfer learning when leveraging a larger 
and more diverse dataset.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the potential to 
transform medical practice within the medical imaging industry and materially 
improve productivity and patient outcomes. However, low acceptability of AI as a 
digital healthcare intervention among medical professionals threatens to 
undermine user uptake levels, hinder meaningful and optimal value-added 
engagement, and ultimately prevent these promising benefits from being realised. 
Understanding the factors underpinning AI acceptability will be vital for 
medical institutions to pinpoint areas of deficiency and improvement within 
their AI implementation strategies. This scoping review aims to survey the 
literature to provide a comprehensive summary of the key factors influencing AI 
acceptability among healthcare professionals in medical imaging domains and the 
different approaches which have been taken to investigate them.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed across five academic 
databases including Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Compendex, and 
Scopus from January 2013 to September 2023. This was done in adherence to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Overall, 31 articles were deemed 
appropriate for inclusion in the scoping review.
RESULTS: The literature has converged towards three overarching categories of 
factors underpinning AI acceptability including: user factors involving trust, 
system understanding, AI literacy, and technology receptiveness; system usage 
factors entailing value proposition, self-efficacy, burden, and workflow 
integration; and socio-organisational-cultural factors encompassing social 
influence, organisational readiness, ethicality, and perceived threat to 
professional identity. Yet, numerous studies have overlooked a meaningful subset 
of these factors that are integral to the use of medical AI systems such as the 
impact on clinical workflow practices, trust based on perceived risk and safety, 
and compatibility with the norms of medical professions. This is attributable to 
reliance on theoretical frameworks or ad-hoc approaches which do not explicitly 
account for healthcare-specific factors, the novelties of AI as software as a 
medical device (SaMD), and the nuances of human-AI interaction from the 
perspective of medical professionals rather than lay consumer or business end 
users.
CONCLUSION: This is the first scoping review to survey the health informatics 
literature around the key factors influencing the acceptability of AI as a 
digital healthcare intervention in medical imaging contexts. The factors 
identified in this review suggest that existing theoretical frameworks used to 
study AI acceptability need to be modified to better capture the nuances of AI 
deployment in healthcare contexts where the user is a healthcare professional 
influenced by expert knowledge and disciplinary norms. Increasing AI 
acceptability among medical professionals will critically require designing 
human-centred AI systems which go beyond high algorithmic performance to 
consider accessibility to users with varying degrees of AI literacy, clinical 
workflow practices, the institutional and deployment context, and the cultural, 
ethical, and safety norms of healthcare professions. As investment into AI for 
healthcare increases, it would be valuable to conduct a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of the causal contribution of these factors to achieving high 
levels of AI acceptability among medical professionals.

Neonates are not able to verbally communicate pain, hindering the correct 
identification of this phenomenon. Several clinical scales have been proposed to 
assess pain, mainly using the facial features of the neonate, but a better 
comprehension of these features is yet required, since several related works 
have shown the subjectivity of these scales. Meanwhile, computational methods 
have been implemented to automate neonatal pain assessment and, although 
performing accurately, these methods still lack the interpretability of the 
corresponding decision-making processes. To address this issue, we propose in 
this work a facial feature extraction framework to gather information and 
investigate the human and machine neonatal pain assessments, comparing the 
visual attention of the facial features perceived by health-professionals and 
parents of neonates with the most relevant ones extracted by eXplainable 
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, considering the VGG-Face and N-CNN deep 
learning architectures. Our experimental results show that the information 
extracted by the computational methods are clinically relevant to neonatal pain 
assessment, but yet do not agree with the facial visual attention of 
health-professionals and parents, suggesting that humans and machines can learn 
from each other to improve their decision-making processes. We believe that 
these findings might advance our understanding of how humans and machines code 
and decode neonatal facial responses to pain, enabling further improvements in 
clinical scales widely used in practical situations and in face-based automatic 
pain assessment tools as well.

Human accuracy in diagnosing psychiatric disorders is still low. Even though 
digitizing health care leads to more and more data, the successful adoption of 
AI-based digital decision support (DDSS) is rare. One reason is that AI 
algorithms are often not evaluated based on large, real-world data. This 
research shows the potential of using deep learning on the medical claims data 
of 812,853 people between 2018 and 2022, with 26,973,943 ICD-10-coded diseases, 
to predict depression (F32 and F33 ICD-10 codes). The dataset used represents 
almost the entire adult population of Estonia. Based on these data, to show the 
critical importance of the underlying temporal properties of the data for the 
detection of depression, we evaluate the performance of non-sequential models 
(LR, FNN), sequential models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM) and the sequential model with a 
decay factor (GRU-Δt, GRU-decay). Furthermore, since explainability is necessary 
for the medical domain, we combine a self-attention model with the GRU decay and 
evaluate its performance. We named this combination Att-GRU-decay. After 
extensive empirical experimentation, our model (Att-GRU-decay), with an AUC 
score of 0.990, an AUPRC score of 0.974, a specificity of 0.999 and a 
sensitivity of 0.944, proved to be the most accurate. The results of our novel 
Att-GRU-decay model outperform the current state of the art, demonstrating the 
potential usefulness of deep learning algorithms for DDSS development. We 
further expand this by describing a possible application scenario of the 
proposed algorithm for depression screening in a general practitioner (GP) 
setting-not only to decrease healthcare costs, but also to improve the quality 
of care and ultimately decrease people's suffering.

BACKGROUND: Designing appropriate clinical dental treatment plans is an urgent 
need because a growing number of dental patients are suffering from partial 
edentulism with the population getting older.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to predict sequential treatment plans from 
electronic dental records.
METHODS: We construct a clinical decision support model, MultiTP, explores the 
unique topology of teeth information and the variation of complicated 
treatments, integrates deep learning models (convolutional neural network and 
recurrent neural network) adaptively, and embeds the attention mechanism to 
produce optimal treatment plans.
RESULTS: MultiTP shows its promising performance with an AUC of 0.9079 and an F 
score of 0.8472 over five treatment plans. The interpretability analysis also 
indicates its capability in mining clinical knowledge from the textual data.
CONCLUSIONS: MultiTP's novel problem formulation, neural network framework, and 
interpretability analysis techniques allow for broad applications of deep 
learning in dental healthcare, providing valuable support for predicting dental 
treatment plans in the clinic and benefiting dental patients.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The MultiTP is an efficient tool that can be implemented 
in clinical practice and integrated into the existing EDR system. By predicting 
treatment plans for partial edentulism, the model will help dentists improve 
their clinical decisions.

BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) analysis was shown in >14,000 individuals 
studied worldwide over the past two decades to be a useful tool to assess risk 
for cardiovascular mortality and sudden arrhythmic death. TWA analysis by the 
modified moving average (MMA) method is FDA-cleared and CMS-reimbursed 
(CAG-00293R2).
OBJECTIVE: Because the MMA technique is inherently suitable for dynamic tracking 
of alternans levels, it was selected for development of artificial intelligence 
(AI)-enabled algorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve 
rapid, efficient, and accurate assessment of P-wave alternans (PWA), R-wave 
alternans (RWA), and TWA.
METHODS: The novel application of CNN algorithms to enhance MMA analysis 
generated efficient and powerful pattern-recognition algorithms for highly 
accurate alternans quantification. Algorithm reliability and accuracy were 
verified using simulated ECGs achieving R2 ≥ 0.99 (p < 0.01) in response to 
noise inputs and artifacts that emulate real-life conditions.
RESULTS: Accuracy of the new AI-MMA algorithms in TWA analysis (n = 5) was 
significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p = 0.036) and 
did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading 
(p = 0.21). Accuracy of AI-MMA in PWA analysis (n = 45) was significantly 
improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p < 0.005) and did not differ 
from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p = 0.89). TWA and PWA 
by AI-MMA were correlated with conventional MMA output over-read by an expert 
reader (R2 = 0.7765, R2 = 0.9504, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This novel technique for AI-MMA analysis could be suitable for use 
in diverse in-hospital and out-of-hospital monitoring systems, including cardiac 
implantable electronic devices and smartwatches, for tracking atrial and 
ventricular arrhythmia risk.

The role of artificial intelligence is emergent in facial plastic surgery. It 
offers specialists a potentially precise and efficient method of understanding 
our technical skills and pathways, and their impacts on patient outcomes and 
error rates. Algorithms have given life to personalised pre-operative 
assessment, surgical planning and outcome simulation, and post-operative 
monitoring. Despite these benefits, limitations at this time include the ethical 
acquisition of large datasets, biases produced by human input and trust in novel 
technologies. Careful consideration should be given to the role artificial 
intelligence may play in shaping the patient-surgeon relationship in the near 
future.

Background The critical care literature has seen an increase in the development 
and validation of tools using artificial intelligence for early detection of 
patient events or disease onset in the intensive care unit (ICU). The 
hemodynamic stability index (HSI) was found to have an AUC of 0.82 in predicting 
the need for hemodynamic intervention in the ICU. Future studies using this tool 
may benefit from targeting those outcomes that are more relevant to clinicians 
and most achievable. Methods A three-round Delphi study was conducted with a 
panel of 10 critical care physicians and three nurses in the United States to 
identify outcomes that may be most relevant and achievable with the HSI when 
evaluated for use in the ICU. To achieve criteria for relevance, at least 65% of 
panelists had to rate an outcome as a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. Results 
Nineteen of 24 outcomes that may be associated with the HSI achieved consensus 
for relevance. The Kemeny-Young approach was used to develop a matrix depicting 
the distribution of outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. 
"Reduces time spent in hemodynamic instability" and "reduces times to 
recognition of hemodynamic instability" were the highest-ranking outcomes 
considering both relevance and achievability. Conclusion This Delphi study was a 
feasible method to identify relevant outcomes that may be associated with an 
appropriate predictive analytic tool in the ICU. These findings can provide 
insight to researchers looking to study such tools to impact outcomes relevant 
to critical care practitioners. Future studies should test these tools in the 
ICU that target the most clinically relevant and achievable outcomes, such as 
time spent hemodynamically unstable or time until actionable nursing assessment 
or treatment.

Purpose: This study introduces a sophisticated computational pipeline, eVir, 
designed for the discovery of antiviral drugs based on their interactions within 
the human protein network. There is a pressing need for cost-effective 
therapeutics for infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), particularly in 
resource-limited countries. Therefore, our team devised an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) system to explore repurposing opportunities for currently used 
oral therapies. The eVir system operates by identifying pharmaceutical compounds 
that mirror the effects of antiviral peptides (AVPs)-fragments of human proteins 
known to interfere with fundamental phases of the viral life cycle: entry, 
fusion, and replication. eVir extrapolates the probable antiviral efficacy of a 
given compound by analyzing its established and predicted impacts on the human 
protein-protein interaction network. This innovative approach provides a 
promising platform for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 or any virus for 
which peptide data is available. Methods: The eVir AI software pipeline 
processes drug-protein and protein-protein interaction networks generated from 
open-source datasets. eVir uses Node2Vec, a graph embedding technique, to 
understand the nuanced connections among drugs and proteins. The embeddings are 
input a Siamese Network (SNet) and MLPs, each tailored for the specific 
mechanisms of entry, fusion, and replication, to evaluate the similarity between 
drugs and AVPs. Scores generated from the SNet and MLPs undergo a Platt 
probability calibration and are combined into a unified score that gauges the 
potential antiviral efficacy of a drug. This integrated approach seeks to boost 
drug identification confidence, offering a potential solution for detecting 
therapeutic candidates with pronounced antiviral potency. Once identified a 
number of compounds were tested for efficacy and toxicity in lung carcinoma 
cells (Calu-3) infected with SARS-CoV-2. A lead compound was further identified 
to determine its efficacy and toxicity in K18-hACE2 mice infected with 
SARS-CoV-2. Computational Predictions: The SNet confidently differentiated 
between similar and dissimilar drug pairs with an accuracy of 97.28% and AUC of 
99.47%. Key compounds identified through these networks included Zinc, 
Mebendazole, Levomenol, Gefitinib, Niclosamide, and Imatinib. Notably, 
Mebendazole and Zinc showcased the highest similarity scores, while Imatinib, 
Levemenol, and Gefitinib also ranked within the top 20, suggesting their 
significant pharmacological potentials. Further examination of protein binding 
analysis using explainable AI focused on reverse engineering the causality of 
the networks. Protein interaction scores for Mebendazole and Imatinib revealed 
their effects on notable proteins such as CDPK1, VEGF2, ABL1, and several 
tyrosine protein kinases. Laboratory Studies: This study determined that 
Mebendazole, Gefitinib, Topotecan and to some extent Carfilzomib showed 
conventional drug-response curves, with IC50 values near or below that of 
Remdesivir with excellent confidence all above R2>0.91, and no cytotoxicity at 
the IC50 concentration in Calu-3 cells. Cyclosporine A showed antiviral 
activity, but also unconventional drug-response curves and low R2 which are 
explained by the non-dose dependent toxicity of the compound. Additionally, 
Niclosamide demonstrated a conventional drug-response curve with high 
confidence; however, its inherent cytotoxicity may be a confounding element that 
misrepresents true antiviral efficacy, by reflecting cellular damage rather than 
a genuine antiviral action. Remdesivir was used as a control compound and was 
evaluated in parallel with the submitted test article and had conventional 
drug-response curves validating the overall results of the assay. Mebendazole 
was identified from the cell studies to have efficacy at non-toxic 
concentrations and were further evaluated in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
Mebendazole administered to K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulted in 
a 44.2% reduction in lung viral load compared to non-treated placebo control 
respectively. There were no significant differences in body weight and all 
clinical chemistry determinations evaluated (i.e., kidney and liver enzymes) 
between the different treatment groups. Conclusion: This research underscores 
the potential of repurposing existing compounds for treating COVID-19. Our 
preliminary findings underscore the therapeutic promise of several compounds, 
notably Mebendazole, in both in vitro and in vivo settings against SARS-CoV-2. 
Several of the drugs explored, especially Mebendazole, are off-label medication; 
their cost-effectiveness position them as economical therapies against 
SARS-CoV-2.

As our understanding of the tumor microenvironment grows, the pathology field is 
increasingly utilizing multianalyte diagnostic assays to understand important 
characteristics of tumor growth. In clinical settings, brightfield chromogenic 
assays represent the gold-standard and have developed significant trust as the 
first-line diagnostic method. However, conventional brightfield tests have been 
limited to low-order assays that are visually interrogated. We have developed a 
hybrid method of brightfield chromogenic multiplexing that overcomes these 
limitations and enables high-order multiplex assays. However, how compatible 
high-order brightfield multiplexed images are with advanced analytical 
algorithms has not been extensively evaluated. In the present study, we address 
this gap by developing a novel 6-marker prostate cancer assay that targets 
diverse aspects of the tumor microenvironment such as prostate-specific 
biomarkers (PSMA and p504s), immune biomarkers (CD8 and PD-L1), a prognostic 
biomarker (Ki-67), as well as an adjunctive diagnostic biomarker (basal cell 
cocktail) and apply the assay to 143 differentially graded adenocarcinoma 
prostate tissues. The tissues were then imaged on our spectroscopic multiplexing 
imaging platform and mined for proteomic and spatial features that were 
correlated with cancer presence and disease grade. Extracted features were used 
to train a UMAP model that differentiated healthy from cancerous tissue with an 
accuracy of 89% and identified clusters of cells based on cancer grade. For 
spatial analysis, cell-to-cell distances were calculated for all biomarkers and 
differences between healthy and adenocarcinoma tissues were studied. We report 
that p504s positive cells were at least 2× closer to cells expressing PD-L1, 
CD8, Ki-67, and basal cell in adenocarcinoma tissues relative to the healthy 
control tissues. These findings offer a powerful insight to understand the 
fingerprint of the prostate tumor microenvironment and indicate that high-order 
chromogenic multiplexing is compatible with digital analysis. Thus, the 
presented chromogenic multiplexing system combines the clinical applicability of 
brightfield assays with the emerging diagnostic power of high-order multiplexing 
in a digital pathology friendly format that is well-suited for translational 
studies to better understand mechanisms of tumor development and growth.

Gastroenterology is a particularly data-rich field, generating vast repositories 
of data that are a fruitful ground for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
learning (ML) applications. In this opinion review, we initially elaborate on 
the current status of the application of AI/ML-based software in 
gastroenterology. Currently, AI/ML-based models have been developed in the 
following applications: Models integrated into the clinical setting following 
real-time patient data flagging patients at high risk for developing a 
gastrointestinal disease, models employing non-invasive parameters that provide 
accurate diagnoses aiming to either replace, minimize, or refine the indications 
of endoscopy, models utilizing genomic data to diagnose various gastrointestinal 
diseases, computer-aided diagnosis systems facilitating the interpretation of 
endoscopy images, models to facilitate treatment allocation and predict the 
response to treatment, and finally, models in prognosis predicting 
complications, recurrence following treatment, and overall survival. Then, we 
elaborate on several challenges and how they may negatively impact the 
widespread application of AI in healthcare and gastroenterology. Specifically, 
we elaborate on concerns regarding accuracy, cost-effectiveness, cybersecurity, 
interpretability, oversight, and liability. While AI is unlikely to replace 
physicians, it will transform the skillset demanded by future physicians to 
practice. Thus, physicians are expected to engage with AI to avoid becoming 
obsolete.

BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE), which has increased in prevalence 
worldwide, is a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although there is a gap 
in the detection rates between endoscopic BE and histological BE in current 
research, we trained our artificial intelligence (AI) system with images of 
endoscopic BE and tested the system with images of histological BE.
AIM: To assess whether an AI system can aid in the detection of BE in our 
setting.
METHODS: Endoscopic narrow-band imaging (NBI) was collected from Chung Shan 
Medical University Hospital and Changhua Christian Hospital, resulting in 724 
cases, with 86 patients having pathological results. Three senior endoscopists, 
who were instructing physicians of the Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan, 
independently annotated the images in the development set to determine whether 
each image was classified as an endoscopic BE. The test set consisted of 160 
endoscopic images of 86 cases with histological results.
RESULTS: Six pre-trained models were compared, and EfficientNetV2B2 (accuracy 
[ACC]: 0.8) was selected as the backbone architecture for further evaluation due 
to better ACC results. In the final test, the AI system correctly identified 66 
of 70 cases of BE and 85 of 90 cases without BE, resulting in an ACC of 94.37%.
CONCLUSION: Our AI system, which was trained by NBI of endoscopic BE, can 
adequately predict endoscopic images of histological BE. The ACC, sensitivity, 
and specificity are 94.37%, 94.29%, and 94.44%, respectively.

Segmenting breast tumors in ultrasonography is challenging due to the low image 
quality and presence of artifacts. Radiologists' studying and diagnosis skills 
are integrated with artificial intelligence to establish a clinical 
learning-based deep learning network in order to robustly extract and delineate 
features of breast fibroadenoma. The spatial local feature contrast (SLFC) 
module captures overall tumor contours, while the channel recursive gated 
attention (CRGA) module enhances edge perception through high-dimensional 
information interaction. Additionally, full-scale feature fusion and enhanced 
deep supervision are applied to improve model stability and performance. To 
achieve smoother boundaries, we introduce a new loss function (cosh-smooth) that 
penalizes and finely tunes tumor edges. Our dataset comprises 1016 clinical 
ultrasound images of breast fibroadenoma with labeled masks, alongside a 
publicly available dataset of 246 ones. Segmentation performance is evaluated 
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean intersection over union 
(MIOU). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MS-CFNet outperforms 
state-of-the-art methods. Compared to TransUNet as a baseline model, MS-CFNet 
improves by 1.47% in DSC and 2.56% in MIOU. The promising result of MS-CFNet is 
attributed to the integration of radiologists' clinical diagnosis procedure and 
the bionic mindset, enhancing the network's ability to recognize and segment 
breast fibroadenomas effectively.

Author information:
(1)Department of Computer Science, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

This research addresses the pervasive issue of traffic congestion during the 
Hajj, where approximately 250,000 vehicles substantially exacerbate travel times 
and road accidents, while also escalating pollution levels, thereby adversely 
affecting public health. Aimed at bolstering the Kingdom's Vision 2030, the 
study focuses on the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced 
communication technologies to optimize traffic management in Mecca. Through the 
innovative deployment of smart cameras and real-time data analytics, the 
proposed system seeks to predict, manage, and alleviate traffic congestion by 
providing alternative routes and facilitating smoother vehicular movement. An 
exploration into the myriad benefits of this AI-integrated system reveals 
potentials such as enhanced road safety, improved emergency response 
efficiencies, and elevated air quality, thereby contributing to the overall 
wellbeing of the community and environment. In addition, the research 
anticipates that reducing traffic bottlenecks will indirectly invigorate local 
businesses and augment tourism revenues, aligning with the objectives of 
enhancing economic prosperity. By advocating a multi-faceted approach to crowd 
monitoring and management, this study underscores the indispensable role of AI 
in revolutionizing traffic management strategies, despite the challenges posed 
by the complexity of real-time data simulation and the unique intricacies of the 
Hajj.

Medicinal plants have got notable attention in recent years in the field of 
pharmaceutical and drug research. The high demand of herbal medicine in the 
rural areas of developing countries and drug industries necessitates correct 
identification of the medicinal plant species which is challenging in absence of 
expert taxonomic knowledge. Against this backdrop, we attempted to assess the 
performance of seven advanced deep learning algorithms in the automated 
identification of the plants from their leaf images and to suggest the best 
model from a comparative study of the models. We meticulously trained VGG16, 
VGG19, DenseNet201, ResNet50V2, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 
deep neural network models. This training utilized a dataset comprising 5878 
images encompassing 30 medicinal species distributed among 20 families. Our 
approach involved two avenues: the utilization of public data (PI) and a blend 
of public and field data (PFI), the latter featuring intricate backgrounds. Our 
study elucidates the robustness of these models in accurately identifying and 
classifying both interfamily and interspecies variations. Despite variations in 
accuracy across diverse families and species, the models demonstrated adeptness 
in these classifications. Comparing the models, we unearthed a crucial insight: 
the Normalized leverage factor (γω) for DenseNet201 stands at 0.19, elevating it 
to the pinnacle position for PI with a remarkable 99.64 % accuracy and 98.31 % 
precision. In the PFI scenario, the same model achieves a γω of 0.15 with a 
commendable 97 % accuracy. These findings serve as a guiding beacon for shaping 
future application tools designed to automate medicinal plant identification at 
the user level.

BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a 
debilitating chronic condition with no identified diagnostic biomarkers to date. 
Its prevalence is as high as 0.89% according to metastudies, with a quarter of 
patients bed- or home-bound, which presents a serious public health challenge. 
Investigations into the inflammation-immunity axis is encouraged by links to 
outbreaks and disease waves. Recently, the research of our group revealed that 
antibodies to beta2-adrenergic (anti-β2AdR) and muscarinic acetylcholine 
(anti-M4) receptors demonstrate sensitivity to the progression of ME/CFS. The 
purpose of this study is to investigate the joint potential of 
inflammatome-characterized by interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
interleukin (IL)-2, IL-21, Il-23, IL-6, IL-17A, Activin-B, immunome (IgG1, IgG2, 
IgG3, IgG4, IgM, and IgA), and receptor-based biomarkers (anti-M3, anti-M4, and 
anti-β2AdR)-for evaluating ME/CFS progression, and to identify an optimal 
selection for future validation in prospective clinical studies.
METHODS: A dataset was used originating from 188 individuals, namely, 54 healthy 
controls, 30 patients with a "mild" condition, 73 patients with a "moderate" 
condition, and 31 patients with a "severe" condition, clinically assessed by 
Fukuda/CDC 1994 and international consensus criteria. Inflammatome, immunome, 
and receptor-based biomarkers were determined in blood plasma via ELISA and 
multiplex methods. Statistical analysis was done via correlation analysis, 
principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest 
classification; inter-group differences were tested via nonparametric 
Kruskal-Wallis H test followed by the two-stage linear step-up procedure of 
Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli, and via Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: The association between inflammatome and immunome markers is broader 
and stronger (coupling) in the severe group. Principal component factoring 
separates components associated with inflammatome, immunome, and receptor 
biomarkers. Random forest modeling demonstrates an excellent accuracy of over 
90% for splitting healthy/with condition groups, and 45% for splitting 
healthy/severity groups. Classifiers with the highest potential are anti-β2AdR, 
anti-M4, IgG4, IL-2, and IL-6.
DISCUSSION: The association between inflammatome and immunome markers is a 
candidate for controlled clinical study of ME/CFS progression markers that could 
be used for treatment individualization. Thus, the coupling effects between 
inflammation and immunity are potentially beneficial for the identification of 
prognostic factors in the context of ME/CFS progression mechanism studies.

intelligence and learning achievement: serial mediating roles of self-efficacy 
and cognitive engagement.

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shocked the world with its 
unprecedented ability and raised significant tensions in the education field. 
Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI 
rather than shuns it. Understanding the mechanism between students interacting 
with GAI tools and their achievement is important for educators and schools, but 
relevant empirical evidence is relatively lacking. Due to the characteristics of 
personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the 
students-GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial 
mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire 
surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: 
(1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student-GAI 
interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated 
by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) 
Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the 
student-GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and 
relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and 
cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial 
mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but 
also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method 
is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the 
results. The findings offer empirical evidence for the incorporation of GAI in 
teaching and learning.

On the necessity to include multiple types of evidence when predicting molecular 
function of proteins.

Machine learning-based platforms are currently revolutionizing many fields of 
molecular biology including structure prediction for monomers or complexes, 
predicting the consequences of mutations, or predicting the functions of 
proteins. However, these platforms use training sets based on currently 
available knowledge and, in essence, are not built to discover novelty. Hence, 
claims of discovering novel functions for protein families using artificial 
intelligence should be carefully dissected, as the dangers of overpredictions 
are real as we show in a detailed analysis of the prediction made by Kim et al 1 
on the function of the YciO protein in the model organism Escherichia coli .

DrugHIVE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder for the Structure-Based 
Design of Drug-Like Molecules.

Weller JA, Rohs R.

Rapid advancement in the computational methods of structure-based drug design 
has led to their widespread adoption as key tools in the early drug development 
process. Recently, the remarkable growth of available crystal structure data and 
libraries of commercially available or readily synthesizable molecules have 
unlocked previously inaccessible regions of chemical space for drug development. 
Paired with improvements in virtual ligand screening methods, these expanded 
libraries are having a significant impact on the success of early drug design 
efforts. However, screening-based approaches are limited in their scalability 
due to computational limits and the sheer scale of drug-like space. A method 
within the quickly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), deep 
generative modeling, is extending the reach of molecular design beyond classical 
methods by learning the fundamental intra- and inter-molecular relationships in 
drug-target systems from existing data. In this work we introduce DrugHIVE, a 
deep structure-based generative model that enables fine-grained control over 
molecular generation. We demonstrate DrugHIVE's capacity to accelerate a wide 
range of common drug design tasks such as de novo generation, molecular 
optimization, scaffold hopping, linker design, and high throughput pattern 
replacement. Our method is highly scalable and can be applied to high confidence 
AlphaFold predicted receptors, extending our ability to generate high quality 
drug-like molecules to a majority of the unsolved human proteome.

Natural language processing (NLP) AI models have gained popularity in research; 
however, ethical considerations are necessary to avoid potential negative 
consequences. This paper identifies and explores the key areas of ethical 
concern for researchers using NLP AI models, such as bias in training data and 
algorithms, plagiarism, data privacy, accuracy of generated content, prompt and 
content generation, and training data quality. To mitigate bias, researchers 
should use diverse training data and regularly evaluate models for potential 
biases. Proper attribution and privacy protection are essential when using 
AI-generated content, while accuracy should be regularly tested and evaluated. 
Specific and appropriate prompts, algorithms, and techniques should be used for 
content generation, and training data quality should be high, diverse, and 
updated regularly. Finally, appropriate authorship credit and avoidance of 
conflicts of interest must be ensured. Adherence to ethical standards, such as 
those outlined by ICMJE, is crucial. These ethical considerations are vital for 
ensuring the quality and integrity of NLP AI model research and avoiding 
negative consequences.

In an era characterized by the convergence of cutting-edge technologies, the 
world of healthcare and public health is on the brink of a profound 
transformation that will shape the future of medicine and wellness. This 
transformation is not merely an incremental step forward but a paradigm shift 
driven by the synergistic integration of digital twins, blockchain technology, 
artificial intelligence, and multi-omics platforms collectively propelling us 
into uncharted territory. Integrating these innovations holds the potential to 
rewrite the rules of engagement in clinical trials, revamp the strategies for 
preventing public health crises, and redefine how we manage, share, and secure 
healthcare data. As we embark on this journey of exploration and innovation, we 
find ourselves at a pivotal juncture, akin to the invention of the microscope in 
biology or the discovery of antibiotics in medicine. We are at the crossroads of 
a new era with immense promise and transformative power.

Despite substantial technical advances and wider clinical use, cochlear implant 
(CI) users continue to report high and elevated listening effort especially 
under challenging noisy conditions. Among all the objective measures to quantify 
listening effort, pupillometry is one of the most widely used and robust 
physiological measures. Previous studies with normally hearing (NH) and 
hearing-impaired (HI) listeners have shown that the relation between speech 
performance in noise and listening effort (as measured by peak pupil dilation) 
is not linear and exhibits an inverted-U shape. However, it is unclear whether 
the same psychometric relation exists in CI users, and whether individual 
differences in auditory sensitivity and central cognitive capacity affect this 
relation. Therefore, we recruited 17 post-lingually deaf CI adults to perform 
speech-in-noise tasks from 0 to 20 dB SNR with a 4 dB step size. Simultaneously, 
their pupillary responses and self-reported subjective effort were recorded. To 
characterize top-down and bottom-up individual variabilities, a spectro-temporal 
modulation task and a set of cognitive abilities were measured. Clinical word 
recognition in quiet and Quality of Life (QoL) were also collected. Results 
showed that at a group level, an inverted-U shape psychometric curve between 
task difficulty (SNR) and peak pupil dilation (PPD) was not observed. Individual 
shape of the psychometric curve was significantly associated with some 
individual factors: CI users with higher clinical word and speech-in-noise 
recognition showed a quadratic decrease of PPD over increasing SNRs; CI users 
with better non-verbal intelligence and lower QoL showed smaller average PPD. To 
summarize, individual differences in CI users had a significant impact on the 
psychometric relation between pupillary response and task difficulty, hence 
affecting the interpretation of pupillary response as listening effort (or 
engagement) at different task difficulty levels. Future research and clinical 
applications should further characterize the possible effects of individual 
factors (such as motivation or engagement) in modulating CI users' occurrence of 
'tipping point' on their psychometric functions, and develop an individualized 
method for reliably quantifying listening effort using pupillometry.

In this study, a novel nonfragile deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method was 
proposed to realize the finite-time control of switched unmanned flight 
vehicles. Control accuracy, robustness, and intelligence were enhanced in the 
proposed control scheme by combining conventional robust control and DRL 
characteristics. In the proposed control strategy, the tracking controller 
consists of a dynamics-based controller and a learning-based controller. The 
conventional robust control approach for the nominal system was used for 
realizing a dynamics-based baseline tracking controller. The learning-based 
controller based on DRL was developed to compensate model uncertainties and 
enhance transient control accuracy. The multiple Lyapunov function approach and 
mode-dependent average dwell time approach were combined to analyze the 
finite-time stability of flight vehicles with asynchronous switching. The linear 
matrix inequalities technique was used to determine the solutions of 
dynamics-based controllers. Online optimization was formulated as a Markov 
decision process. The adaptive deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm was 
adopted to improve efficiency and convergence. In this algorithm, the 
actor-critic structure was used and adaptive hyperparameters were introduced. 
Unlike the conventional DRL algorithm, nonfragile control theory and adaptive 
reward function were used in the proposed algorithm to achieve excellent 
stability and training efficiency. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
presented algorithm through comparative simulations.

An AI assistant to help review and improve causal reasoning in epidemiological 
documents.

America.

Drawing sound causal inferences from observational data is often challenging for 
both authors and reviewers. This paper discusses the design and application of 
an Artificial Intelligence Causal Research Assistant (AIA) that seeks to help 
authors improve causal inferences and conclusions drawn from epidemiological 
data in health risk assessments. The AIA-assisted review process provides 
structured reviews and recommendations for improving the causal reasoning, 
analyses and interpretations made in scientific papers based on epidemiological 
data. Causal analysis methodologies range from earlier Bradford-Hill 
considerations to current causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) and related 
models. AIA seeks to make these methods more accessible and useful to 
researchers. AIA uses an external script (a "Causal AI Booster" (CAB) program 
based on classical AI concepts of slot-filling in frames organized into task 
hierarchies to complete goals) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs), such as 
OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's LaMDA (Bard), to systematically review manuscripts 
and create both (a) recommendations for what to do to improve analyses and 
reporting; and (b) explanations and support for the recommendations. Review 
tables and summaries are completed systematically by the LLM in order. For 
example, recommendations for how to state and caveat causal conclusions in the 
Abstract and Discussion sections reflect previous analyses of the Study Design 
and Data Analysis sections. This work illustrates how current AI can contribute 
to reviewing and providing constructive feedback on research documents. We 
believe that such AI-assisted review shows promise for enhancing the quality of 
causal reasoning and exposition in epidemiological studies. It suggests the 
potential for effective human-AI collaboration in scientific authoring and 
review processes.

INTRODUCTION: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting 
up to 300 million people globally. Despite its high prevalence and debilitating 
effects, only one-third of patients newly diagnosed with depression initiate 
treatment. Electronic cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) is an effective 
treatment for depression and is a feasible solution to make mental health care 
more accessible. Due to its online format, e-CBT can be combined with variable 
therapist engagement to address different care needs. Typically, a 
multi-professional care team determines which combination therapy most benefits 
the patient. However, this process can add to the costs of these programs. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed to offset these costs.
METHODS: This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial recruiting 
individuals experiencing depression. The degree of care intensity a participant 
will receive will be randomly decided by either: (1) a machine learning 
algorithm, or (2) an assessment made by a group of healthcare professionals. 
Subsequently, participants will receive depression-specific e-CBT treatment 
through the secure online platform. There will be three available intensities of 
therapist interaction: (1) e-CBT; (2) e-CBT with a 15-20-min phone/video call; 
and (3) e-CBT with pharmacotherapy. This approach aims to accurately allocate 
care tailored to each patient's needs, allowing for more efficient use of 
resources.
DISCUSSION: Artificial intelligence and providing patients with varying 
intensities of care can increase the efficiency of mental health care services. 
This study aims to determine a cost-effective method to decrease depressive 
symptoms and increase treatment adherence to online psychotherapy by allocating 
the correct intensity of therapist care for individuals diagnosed with 
depression. This will be done by comparing a decision-making machine learning 
algorithm to a multi-professional care team. This approach aims to accurately 
allocate care tailored to each patient's needs, allowing for more efficient use 
of resources with the convergence of technologies and healthcare.
ETHICS: The study received ethics approval and began participant recruitment in 
December 2022. Participant recruitment has been conducted through targeted 
advertisements and physician referrals. Complete data collection and analysis 
are expected to conclude by August 2024.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.Gov, identifier NCT04747873.

The 2022 World Cup used new Enhanced Football Intelligence (EFI) data, stoppage 
time calculation methods and substitution rules that were introduced by FIFA. 
The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of EFI in match analysis 
and to identify the key indicators that influence the match and provide a 
reference for coaches' tactical design and training. Data were derived from the 
FIFA website, including EFI data for 48 matches at the group stage of the Qatar 
World Cup. A total of 46 indicators were used for analysis and the average 
values of the corresponding indicators for the different competition results 
were used in the analysis to identify the key index that determines the outcome 
of the competition. Apart from scoring more goals and having more assists, 
winning teams had significantly more attempts on target than drawing and losing 
teams (p < 0.05); Winning teams had significantly more attempts inside the 
penalty area, completed defensive line breaks and receptions behind the 
defensive line than losing teams (p < 0.05). There is no difference in 
possession between matches with different results (p > 0.05). Goals were 
significantly correlated with completed defensive line breaks and receptions 
behind the defensive line (r = 0.27-0.30, p < 0.01). Attempts on target was 
significantly positively correlated with receptions, final third entries and 
line breaks (r = 0.31-0.67, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with defensive 
pressures applied (r = -0.35, p < 0.01). The efficiency of the offense is more 
important. Teams need to have more receptions, final third entries and line 
breaks to get more shots on target rather than possession. This study may help 
coaches to interpret the game from a multi-dimensional perspective and coaches 
can use EFI to help their teams improve their match performance.

The author traces his experience with the application of computers in clinical 
microbiology over the past 60 years, specifically in directing clinicians to 
treat bacterial infections diagnosed by the laboratory and the antibacterial 
agent(s) that could be used to treat those infections. Appropriate use of 
antibiotics will result in reduced antimicrobial resistance, which is increasing 
worldwide. An early form of AI, Mycin (1976), a system based on rules provided 
by experts designed to propose antibiotic regimens for central nervous system 
infections, was never applied due to the limitations in the number of rules that 
could be incorporated into the clinical workflow. Machine learning (ML) was 
developed to overcome the limitations of expert systems. Several variables that 
influence the outcome bacteria/drug interaction, such as the source of the 
infection, absence of antimicrobial resistance markers, patients' health 
profile, and the historical susceptibility within the hospital and the local 
area are incorporated in the proposed comprehensive AI/ML program. The role of 
AI in the discovery of new antimicrobial agents is also addressed.

Evaluation of CINA® LVO artificial intelligence software for detection of large 
vessel occlusion in brain CT angiography.

Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.
(2)Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the ability of the CINA® LVO software to 
detect large vessel occlusions eligible for mechanical thrombectomy on CTA using 
conventional neuroradiological assessment as gold standard.
METHODS: Retrospectively, two hundred consecutive patients referred for a brain 
CTA and two hundred patients that had been subject for endovascular 
thrombectomy, with an accessible preceding CTA, were assessed for large vessel 
occlusions (LVO) using the CINA® LVO software. The patients were sub-grouped by 
occlusion site. The original radiology report was used as ground truth and cases 
with disagreement were reassessed. Two-by-two tables were created and measures 
for LVO detection were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of four-hundred patients were included; 221 LVOs were present 
in 215 patients (54 %). The overall specificity was high for LVOs in the 
anterior circulation (93 %). The overall sensitivity for LVOs in the anterior 
circulation was 54 % with the highest sensitivity for the M1 segment of the 
middle cerebral artery (87 %) and T-type internal carotid occlusions (84 %). The 
sensitivity was low for occlusions in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral 
artery (13 % and 0 % for proximal and distal M2 occlusions respectively) and in 
posterior circulation occlusions (0 %, not included in the intended use of the 
software).
CONCLUSIONS: LVO detection sensitivity for the CINA® LVO software differs 
largely depending on the location of the occlusion, with low sensitivity for 
detection of some LVOs potentially eligible for mechanical thrombectomy. Further 
development of the software to increase sensitivity to all LVO locations would 
increase the clinical usefulness.

Children, adolescents, and young adult cancer survivors (CAYAs) constitute a 
growing population requiring a customized approach to mitigate the incidence of 
severe complications throughout their lifetimes. During cancer treatment, CAYAs 
cancer survivors undergo significant disruptions in their nutritional status, 
elevating the risks of mortality, morbidity, and cardiovascular events. The 
assessment of nutritional status during cancer treatment involves anthropometric 
and dietary evaluations, emphasizing the necessity for regular assessments and 
the timely identification of risk factors. Proactive nutritional interventions, 
addressing both undernutrition and overnutrition, should be tailored to specific 
age groups and incorporate a family-centered approach. Despite encouraging 
interventions, a notable evidence gap persists. The goal of this review is to 
comprehensively examine the existing evidence on potential nutritional 
interventions for CAYAs cancer survivors. We explore the evidence so far 
collected on the nutritional intervention strategies elaborated for CAYAs cancer 
survivors that should target both undernutrition and overnutrition, being 
age-specific and involving a family-based approach. Furthermore, we suggest 
harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to anticipate and prevent malnutrition 
in CAYAs cancer survivors, contributing to the identification of novel risk 
factors and promoting proactive, personalized healthcare.

INTRODUCTION: In the field of pediatric trauma computer-aided detection (CADe) 
and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems have emerged offering a promising 
avenue for improved patient care. Especially children with wrist fractures may 
benefit from machine learning (ML) solutions, since some of these lesions may be 
overlooked on conventional X-ray due to minimal compression without dislocation 
or mistaken for cartilaginous growth plates. In this article, we describe the 
development and optimization of AI algorithms for wrist fracture detection in 
children.
METHODS: A team of IT-specialists, pediatric radiologists and pediatric surgeons 
used the freely available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset containing annotated pediatric 
trauma wrist radiographs of 6,091 patients, a total number of 10,643 studies 
(20,327 images). First, a basic object detection model, a You Only Look Once 
object detector of the seventh generation (YOLOv7) was trained and tested on 
these data. Then, team decisions were taken to adjust data preparation, image 
sizes used for training and testing, and configuration of the detection model. 
Furthermore, we investigated each of these models using an Explainable 
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method called Gradient Class Activation Mapping 
(Grad-CAM). This method visualizes where a model directs its attention to before 
classifying and regressing a certain class through saliency maps.
RESULTS: Mean average precision (mAP) improved when applying optimizations 
pre-processing the dataset images (maximum increases of + 25.51% mAP@0.5 and 
+ 39.78% mAP@[0.5:0.95]), as well as the object detection model itself (maximum 
increases of + 13.36% mAP@0.5 and + 27.01% mAP@[0.5:0.95]). Generally, when 
analyzing the resulting models using XAI methods, higher scoring model 
variations in terms of mAP paid more attention to broader regions of the image, 
prioritizing detection accuracy over precision compared to the less accurate 
models.
DISCUSSION: This paper supports the implementation of ML solutions for pediatric 
trauma care. Optimization of a large X-ray dataset and the YOLOv7 model improve 
the model's ability to detect objects and provide valid diagnostic support to 
health care specialists. Such optimization protocols must be understood and 
advocated, before comparing ML performances against health care specialists.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify phenotypes with potential prognostic 
significance in aortic stenosis (AS) patients after transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) through a clustering approach.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This multi-centre retrospective study included 1365 
patients with severe AS who underwent TAVR between January 2015 and March 2019. 
Among demographics, laboratory, and echocardiography parameters, 20 variables 
were selected through dimension reduction and used for unsupervised clustering. 
Phenotypes and outcomes were compared between clusters. Patients were randomly 
divided into a derivation cohort (n = 1092: 80%) and a validation cohort (n = 
273: 20%). Three clusters with markedly different features were identified. 
Cluster 1 was associated predominantly with elderly age, a high aortic valve 
gradient, and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; Cluster 2 consisted of 
preserved LV ejection fraction, larger aortic valve area, and high blood 
pressure; and Cluster 3 demonstrated tachycardia and low flow/low gradient AS. 
Adverse outcomes differed significantly among clusters during a median of 2.2 
years of follow-up (P < 0.001). After adjustment for clinical and 
echocardiographic data in a Cox proportional hazards model, Cluster 3 (hazard 
ratio, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-9.94; P = 0.001) was associated with 
increased risk of adverse outcomes. In sequential Cox models, a model based on 
clinical data and echocardiographic variables (χ2 = 18.4) was improved by 
Cluster 3 (χ2 = 31.5; P = 0.001) in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: Unsupervised cluster analysis of patients after TAVR revealed three 
different groups for assessment of prognosis. This provides a new perspective in 
the categorization of patients after TAVR that considers comorbidities and 
extravalvular cardiac dysfunction.

In the public health portfolio of disaster tools, rapid needs assessments are 
essential intelligence data mining resources that can assess immediate needs in 
almost all hazard scenarios. Following prolonged and unusual seismic activity 
that caused significant structural damage, mainly in the southwest part of the 
island of Puerto Rico, thousands of area residents were forced to leave their 
homes and establish improvised camps. The austere environmental exposure and 
limited access to safety and hygiene services prompted public health authorities 
to request assistance with conducting a rapid needs assessment of those 
encampments. This report summarizes the design, organization, and execution of a 
rapid needs assessment of improvised camps following a strong sequence of 
earthquakes in Puerto Rico.

This paper analyzes changes in emergency management in Belgium that have 
accompanied growing security concerns in Western countries since the 9/11 
terrorist attacks in the United States. Using an instrumentation approach, we 
show how the adoption of a particular regulatory instrument helped put police 
and judicial actors center stage and gave a more prominent place to the inquiry. 
We show how the instrument is hampering cooperation, communication, and trust in 
rescue services and may undermine the collective intelligence at the core of 
emergency responses. We argue that these changes are indicators of the rise of a 
new "emergency management security regime" that contradicts the original safety 
regime applied since the 1960s.

BACKGROUND: The scientific revolution in the treatment of many illnesses has 
been significantly aided by stem cells. This paper presents an optimal control 
on a mathematical model of chemotherapy and stem cell therapy for cancer 
treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To develop effective hybrid techniques that combine the optimal 
control theory (OCT) with the evolutionary algorithm and multi-objective swarm 
algorithm. The developed technique is aimed to reduce the number of cancerous 
cells while utilizing the minimum necessary chemotherapy medications and 
minimizing toxicity to protect patients' health.
METHODS: Two hybrid techniques are proposed in this paper. Both techniques 
combined OCT with the evolutionary algorithm and multi-objective swarm algorithm 
which included MOEA/D, MOPSO, SPEA II and PESA II. This study evaluates the 
performance of two hybrid techniques in terms of reducing cancer cells and drug 
concentrations, as well as computational time consumption.
RESULTS: In both techniques, MOEA/D emerges as the most effective algorithm due 
to its superior capability in minimizing tumour size and cancer drug 
concentration.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of integrating OCT and 
evolutionary algorithms as a robust approach for optimizing cancer chemotherapy 
treatment.

Can Large Language Models Generate Outpatient Clinic Letters at First 
Consultation That Incorporate Complication Profiles From UK and USA Aesthetic 
Plastic Surgery Associations?

Roberts RHR, Ali SR, Dobbs TD, Whitaker IS.

The importance of written communication between clinicians and patients, 
especially in the wake of the Supreme Court case of Montgomery vs Lanarkshire, 
has led to a shift toward patient-centric care in the United Kingdom. This study 
investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google 
Bard in enhancing clinic letters with gold-standard complication profiles, 
aiming to improve patients' understanding and save clinicians' time in aesthetic 
plastic surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in 
integrating complication profiles from authoritative sources into clinic 
letters, thus enhancing patient comprehension and clinician efficiency in 
aesthetic plastic surgery. Seven widely performed aesthetic procedures were 
chosen, and complication profiles were sourced from the British Association of 
Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons 
(ASPS). We evaluated the proficiency of the ChatGPT4, ChatGPT3.5, and Google 
Bard in generating clinic letters which incorporated complication profiles from 
online resources. These letters were assessed for readability using an online 
tool, targeting a recommended sixth-grade reading level. ChatGPT4 achieved the 
highest compliance in integrating complication profiles from BAAPS and ASPS 
websites, with average readability grades between eighth and ninth. ChatGPT3.5 
and Google Bard showed lower compliance, particularly when accessing paywalled 
content like the ASPS Informed Consent Bundle. In conclusion, LLMs, particularly 
ChatGPT4, show promise in enhancing patient communications in aesthetic plastic 
surgery by effectively incorporating standard complication profiles into clinic 
letters. This aids in informed decision making and time saving for clinicians. 
However, the study underscores the need for improvements in data accessibility, 
search capabilities, and ethical considerations for optimal LLM integration into 
healthcare communications. Future enhancements should focus on better 
interpretation of inaccessible formats and a Human in the Loop approach to 
combine Artifical Intelligence capabilities with clinician expertise.

In the past few years, privacy concerns have grown, making the financial models 
of businesses more vulnerable to attack. In many cases, it is hard to emphasize 
the importance of monitoring things in real-time with data from Internet of 
Things (IoT) devices. The people who make the IoT devices and those who use them 
face big problems when they try to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques 
in real-world applications, where data must be collected and processed at a 
central location. Federated learning (FL) has made a decentralized, cooperative 
AI system that can be used by many IoT apps that use AI. It is possible because 
it can train AI on IoT devices that are spread out and do not need to share 
data. FL allows local models to be trained on local data and share their 
knowledge to improve a global model. Also, shared learning allows models from 
all over the world to be trained using data from all over the world. This 
article looks at the IoT in all of its forms, including "smart" businesses, 
"smart" cities, "smart" transportation, and "smart" healthcare. This study looks 
at the safety problems that the federated learning with IoT (FL-IoT) area has 
brought to market. This research is needed to explore because federated learning 
is a new technique, and a small amount of work is done on challenges faced 
during integration with IoT. This research also helps in the real world in such 
applications where encrypted data must be sent from one place to another. 
Researchers and graduate students are the audience of our article.

Computational intelligence and nature-inspired computing have changed the way 
biologically and linguistically driven computing paradigms are made. In the last 
few decades, they have been used more and more to solve optimisation problems in 
the real world. Computational linguistics has its roots in linguistics, but most 
of the studies being done today are led by computer scientists. Data-driven and 
machine-learning methods have become more popular than handwritten language 
rules, which shows this shift. This study uses a new method called Computational 
Linguistics-based mood Analysis using Enhanced Beetle Antenna Search with deep 
learning (CLSA-EBASDL) to tackle the important problem of mood analysis during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine how people felt about the COVID-19 
pandemic by studying social media texts. The method is made up of three main 
steps. First, data pre-processing changes raw data into a shape that can be 
used. After that, word embedding is done using the 'bi-directional encoder 
representations of transformers (BERT) process. An attention-based bidirectional 
long short-term memory (ABiLSTM) network is at the heart of mood classification. 
The Enhanced Beetle Antenna Search (EBAS) method, in particular, fine-tunes 
hyperparameters so that the ABiLSTM model works at its best. Many tests show 
that the CLSA-EBASDL method works better than others. Comparative studies show 
that it works, making it the best method for analysing opinion during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary source of energy losses in distribution networks (DNs) is rooted in 
line losses, which is crucial to conduct a thorough and reasonable examination 
of any unusual sources of line losses to guarantee the power supply in a timely 
and safe manner. In recent studies, identifying and analyzing abnormal line 
losses in DNs has been a widely and challenging research subject. This article 
investigates a key technology for the line loss analyses of DNs and intelligent 
diagnosis of abnormal causes by implementing artificial intelligence (AI), 
resulting in several prominent results. The proposed algorithm optimizes the 
parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) and suggests an intelligent 
diagnosis algorithm called the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm and Support 
Vector Machine (ISSA-SVM). The ISSA-SVM algorithm is trained to calculate the 
data anomalies of line losses when changing loads and exhibiting exceptional 
performance to identify abnormal line losses. The accuracy of abnormality 
identification employing the ISSA-SVM algorithm reaches an impressive 98%, 
surpassing the performances of other available algorithms. Moreover, the 
practical performance of the proposed approach for analyzing large volumes of 
abnormal line loss data daily in DNs is also noteworthy. The ISSA-SVM accurately 
identifies the root causes of abnormal line losses and lowers the error in 
calculating abnormal line loss data. By combining different types of power 
operation data and creating a multidimensional feature traceability model, the 
study successfully determines the factors contributing to abnormal line losses. 
The relationship between transformers and voltage among various lines is 
determined by using the Pearson correlation, which provides valuable insights 
into the relationship between these variables and line losses. The algorithm's 
reliability and its potential to be applied to real-world scenarios bring an 
opportunity to improve the efficiency and safety of power supply systems. The 
ISSA that incorporates advanced techniques such as the Sobol sequence, golden 
sine algorithm, and Gaussian difference mutation appears to be a promising tool.

The burgeoning role of social network analysis (SNA) in various fields raises 
complex challenges, particularly in the analysis of dark and dim networks 
involved in illicit activities. Existing models like the stochastic block model 
(SBM), exponential graph model (EGM), and latent space model (LSM) are limited 
in scope, often only suitable for one-mode networks. This article introduces a 
novel fuzzy multiple criteria multiple constraint model (FMC2) tailored for 
community detection in two-mode networks, which are particularly common in dark 
networks. The proposed method quantitatively determines the relationships 
between nodes based on a probabilistic measure and uses distance metrics to 
identify communities within the network. Moreover, the model establishes fuzzy 
boundaries to differentiate between the most and least influential nodes. We 
validate the efficacy of FMC2 using the Noordin Terrorist dataset and conduct 
extensive simulations to evaluate performance metrics. The results demonstrate 
that FMC2 not only effectively identifies communities but also ranks influential 
nodes within them, contributing to a nuanced understanding of complex networks. 
The method promises broad applicability and adaptability, particularly in 
intelligence and security domains where identifying influential actors within 
covert networks is critical.

The fourth industrial revolution, often referred to as Industry 4.0, has 
revolutionized the manufacturing sector by integrating emerging technologies 
such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine and deep learning, Industrial 
Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud computing, cyber physical systems (CPSs) and 
cognitive computing, throughout the production life cycle. Predictive 
maintenance (PdM) emerges as a critical component, utilizing data analytic to 
track machine health and proactively detect machinery failures. Deep learning 
(DL), is pivotal in this context, offering superior accuracy in prediction 
through neural networks' data processing capabilities. However, DL adoption in 
PdM faces challenges, including continuous model updates and domain dependence. 
Meanwhile, centralized DL models, prevalent in PdM, pose security risks such as 
central points of failure and unauthorized access. To address these issues, this 
study presents an innovative decentralized PdM system integrating DL, 
blockchain, and decentralized storage based on the InterPlanetary File System 
(IPFS) for accurately predicting Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL). DL handles 
predictive tasks, while blockchain secures data orchestration. Decentralized 
storage safeguards model metadata and training data for dynamic models. The 
system features synchronized two DL pipelines for time series data, encompassing 
prediction and training mechanisms. The detailed material and methods of this 
research shed light on the system's development and validation processes. 
Rigorous validation confirms the system's accuracy, performance, and security 
through an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate the system's dynamic 
updating and domain independence. Prediction model surpass state-of-the-art 
models in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) score. Blockchain-based 
scalability performance was tested based on smart contract gas usage, and the 
analysis shows efficient performance across varying input and output data 
scales. A comprehensive CIA analysis highlights the system's robust security 
features, addressing confidentiality, integrity, and availability aspects. The 
proposed decentralized predictive maintenance (PdM) system, which incorporates 
deep learning (DL), blockchain technology, and decentralized storage, has the 
potential to improve predictive accuracy and overcome significant security and 
scalability obstacles. Consequently, this system holds promising implications 
for the advancement of predictive maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0.

The one-dimensional cutting-stock problem (1D-CSP) consists of obtaining a set 
of items of different lengths from stocks of one or different lengths, where the 
minimization of waste is one of the main objectives to be achieved. This problem 
arises in several industries like wood, glass, and paper, among others similar. 
Different approaches have been designed to deal with this problem ranging from 
exact algorithms to hybrid methods of heuristics or metaheuristics. The African 
Buffalo Optimization (ABO) algorithm is used in this work to address the 1D-CSP. 
This algorithm has been recently introduced to solve combinatorial problems such 
as travel salesman and bin packing problems. A procedure was designed to improve 
the search by taking advantage of the location of the buffaloes just before it 
is needed to restart the herd, with the aim of not to losing the advance reached 
in the search. Different instances from the literature were used to test the 
algorithm. The results show that the developed method is competitive in waste 
minimization against other heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid approaches.

Enhancing public sector enterprise risk management through interactive 
information processing.

INTRODUCTION: Federal agencies are increasingly expected to adopt enterprise 
risk management (ERM). However, public sector adoption of ERM has typically 
focused on the economic efficiency of tax-financed activities based on 
control-based practices. This reflects an emphasis on quantifiable concerns that 
invariably directs attention to risk, that (by definition) relates to 
identifiable and measurable events, thereby downplaying uncertain and unknown 
aspects of public exposures. This is a potentially serious shortcoming as 
government entities often act as society's risk managers of last resort. When 
extreme events happen what were previously considered private matters can 
quickly turn into public obligations. Hence, there is a need for proactive 
assessments of the evolving public risk landscape to discern unpredictable-even 
unknowable-developments.
METHODS: The article reviews recent empirical studies on public risk management 
practices, effects of digitalization in public sector institutions, current 
strategic management research, and insights uncovered from a recent study of 
risk management practices in federal agencies. On this basis, the article 
explains how the ability to generate value from ERM can be enhanced when it 
intertwines with local responsive initiatives and central strategic risk 
analyses. It can form a dynamic adaptive risk management process where insights 
from dispersed actors inform updated risk analyses based on local autonomy and 
open exchange of information. This approach builds on specific structural 
features embedded in culture-driven aspirations to generate collaborative 
solutions. Its functional mode is an interactive control system with open 
discussions across levels and functions in contrast to conventional diagnostic 
controls that monitor predetermined key performance indicators (KPIs) and key 
risk indicators (KRIs).
FINDINGS: Backed by theoretical rationales and empirical research evidence, it 
is found that applications of ERM frameworks can produce positive results but is 
unable to deal with a public risk landscape characterized by uncertain 
unpredictable conditions with potentially extreme outcome effects. It is shown 
how interactive exchange of fast local insights and slow integrated strategic 
risk analyses supported by digitized data processing can form a dynamic adaptive 
system that enable public sector institutions to deal with emergent high-scale 
exposures. It is explained how the requirement for conducive organizational 
structures and supportive values require a new strategic risk leadership 
approach, which is contrasted to observed practices in federal agencies that are 
constrained by prevailing public governance requirements.
DISCUSSION: The need to deal with uncertainty and unknown conditions demands a 
cognitive shift in current thinking from a primary focus on risk to also 
appraise complexity and prepare for the unexpected where data-driven methods can 
uncover emergent exposures through dynamic information processing. This requires 
strategic risk leaders that recognize the significance of complex public 
exposures with many unknowns and a willingness to facilitate digitalized 
information processing rooted in a collaborative organizational climate. If 
handled properly, adoption of ERM in public risk management can consider 
emergent dimensions in complex public exposures applying interactive information 
processing as a dynamic adaptive risk management approach incorporating 
digitized methods to solicit collective intelligence for strategic risk 
updating.

This paper pioneers the exploration of ocular cancer, and its management with 
the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. Existing literature 
presents a significant increase in new eye cancer cases in 2023, experiencing a 
higher incidence rate. Extensive research was conducted using online databases 
such as PubMed, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Springer. To conduct 
this review, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 
(PRISMA) guidelines are used. Of the collected 62 studies, only 20 documents met 
the inclusion criteria. The review study identifies seven ocular cancer types. 
Important challenges associated with ocular cancer are highlighted, including 
limited awareness about eye cancer, restricted healthcare access, financial 
barriers, and insufficient infrastructure support. Financial barriers is one of 
the widely examined ocular cancer challenges in the literature. The potential 
role and limitations of ChatGPT are discussed, emphasizing its usefulness in 
providing general information to physicians, noting its inability to deliver 
up-to-date information. The paper concludes by presenting the potential future 
applications of ChatGPT to advance research on ocular cancer globally.

Trichinellosis is a globally diffused foodborne parasitic disease caused by 
nematodes of the Trichinella complex. During evolution, guided by ecological 
interactions, natural selection, and biochemical "intelligence", these parasites 
developed admirable strategies to infect the host's organism. One of the most 
fascinating is represented by the nurse cell formation in muscular tissue (e.g., 
diaphragm, skeletal muscle, extrinsic ocular muscles, etc.). This strategy 
allowed the parasite to adapt and conquer the wider host species spectrum, 
including ungulates and humans. Consumption of undercooked meat from infected 
wild ungulates constitutes the most important source of infection for the human 
species. In this study, we show the prevalence of Trichinella spp. in hunted 
wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Central Italy. During the hunting season 2021/2022 in 
the province of Rieti, 554 wild boar diaphragm biopsies were collected for 
Trichinella spp. screening, in accordance with Regulation EU 1375/2015. An 
artificial digestion method was used for the detection of Trichinella spp. 
larval forms. The results revealed a positivity of 0.18% (1/554), and molecular 
biology identification demonstrated the presence of Trichinella britovi in the 
positive sample. This species is the most diffused in wild ungulate populations 
in Central Italy and the most frequently isolated in human patients with 
trichinellosis from this area, showing a close epidemiological relation between 
Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa for Trichinella spp. diffusion in an ecosystem. 
Epidemiological surveillance, in receptive animal species destined for human 
consumption and at any One Health level, represents the main "winning" strategy 
in the control of this worldwide, widespread foodborne parasitic disease.

PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of nearest neighbor (NN)- and 
variational autoencoder (VAE)-smoothing algorithms to reduce variability and 
enhance the performance of glaucoma visual field (VF) progression models.
DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.
SUBJECTS: 7150 eyes (4232 patients), with ≥ 5 years of follow-up and ≥ 6 visits.
METHODS: Vsual field thresholds were smoothed with the NN and VAE algorithms. 
The mean total deviation (mTD) and VF index rates, pointwise linear regression 
(PLR), permutation of PLR (PoPLR), and the glaucoma rate index were applied to 
the unsmoothed and smoothed data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of progressing eyes and the conversion to 
progression were compared between the smoothed and unsmoothed data. A simulation 
series of noiseless VFs with various patterns of glaucoma damage was used to 
evaluate the specificity of the smoothing models.
RESULTS: The mean values of age and follow-up time were 62.8 (standard 
deviation: 12.6) years and 10.4 (standard deviation: 4.7) years, respectively. 
The proportion of progression was significantly higher for the NN and VAE 
smoothed data compared with the unsmoothed data. VF progression occurred 
significantly earlier with both smoothed data compared with unsmoothed data 
based on mTD rates, PLR, and PoPLR methods. The ability to detect the 
progressing eyes was similar for the unsmoothed and smoothed data in the 
simulation data.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoothing VF data with NN and VAE algorithms improves the 
signal-to-noise ratio for detection of change, results in earlier detection of 
VF progression, and could help monitor glaucoma progression more effectively in 
the clinical setting.

The rapid development of big data technology and artificial intelligence has 
provided a new perspective on sports injury prevention. Although data-driven 
algorithms have achieved some valuable results in the field of sports injury 
risk assessment, the lack of sufficient generalization of models and the 
inability to automate feature extraction have made it challenging to deploy 
research results in the real world. Therefore, this study attempts to build an 
injury risk prediction model using a combination of time-series image encoding 
and deep learning algorithms to address this issue better. This study used the 
time-series image encoding approach for feature construction to represent 
relationships between values at different moments, including Gramian Angular 
Summation Field (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF), Markov 
Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plot (RP). Deep Convolutional 
Auto-Encoder (DCAE) learned the image-encoded data for representation to obtain 
features with good discrimination, and the classifier was performed using Deep 
Neural Network (DNN). The results from five repeated experiments show that the 
GASF-DCAE-DNN model is overall better in the training (AUC: 0.985 ± 0.001, 
Gmean: 0.930 ± 0.007, Sensitivity: 0.997 ± 0.003, Specificity: 0.868 ± 0.013) 
and test sets (AUC: 0.891 ± 0.026, Gmean: 0.830 ± 0.027, Sensitivity: 0.816 ± 
0.039, Specificity: 0.845 ± 0.022), with good discriminative power, robustness, 
and generalization ability. Compared with the best model reported in the 
literature, the AUC, Gmean, Sensitivity, and Specificity of the GASF-DCAE-DNN 
model were higher by 23.9%, 27.5%, 39.7%, and 16.2%, respectively, which 
confirmed the validity and practicability of the model in injury risk 
prediction. In addition, differences in injury risk patterns between the 
training and test sets were identified through shapley additivity 
interpretation. It was also found that the training volume was an essential 
factor that affected injury risk prediction. The model proposed in this study 
provides a powerful injury risk prediction tool for future sports injury 
prevention practice.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tracking clean electricity generation in developing 
economies is highly challenging owing to the influence of turbulent external 
factors. Clean electricity is a significant enabler of striving toward 
environmental sustainability. In this research, we aim to model hydro, nuclear, 
and renewable electricity generation in India through applied predictive 
modeling. We also strive to uncover the influence of the critical determinants 
responsible for clean electricity growth.
METHODOLOGY: We propose a granular predictive framework comprising ensemble 
empirical mode decomposition, clustering applications in spatial data based on 
density, including noise, and atom search optimization-based novel optimization 
methodology to predict absolute figures of clean energy generation. The 
framework uses a series of socio-economic factors reflecting household demand 
and industrial growth in India as explanatory variables.
RESULTS: The rigorous scrutiny of the predictive framework specifies hydro 
electricity generation is relatively more predictable during the time horizon 
influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The deployment of dedicated explainable 
artificial intelligence (AI) tools suggests an increased adoption of clean 
electricity in selected industrial sectors in India, which broadly governs the 
evolutionary pattern.
CONCLUSION: The underlying research is the first of its kind to fathom the daily 
temporal dynamics of clean electricity generation in the Indian context. 
Consideration of three distinct clean electricity sources during highly volatile 
time regimes underscores the contribution of the work. The predictive framework 
survives a stringent performance check, which justifies the robustness of the 
same. Demand in different industrial sectors in India profoundly influences the 
growth toward clean electricity.

With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 2.0, computers are now 
equipped with new creative capabilities and are playing an increasingly 
significant role in design. The use of AI augmentation has the potential to 
enhance design performance, however, there is limited research on the acceptance 
of AI-augmented design. The research gap under consideration in this study is 
addressed by presenting an acceptance model designed for AI-augmented design. 
This model integrates a range of variables including perceived privacy risk, 
enjoyment, perceived value, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, 
perceived behavioral control, social influence, and behavioral intention. The 
proposed model was validated through a questionnaire survey of 249 designers in 
China. The results reveal that enjoyment, perceived value, perceived ease of 
use, perceived behavioral control, and social influence have a significant 
positive impact on users' intention to use AI-augmented design, while perceived 
privacy risk has a significant negative impact. Perceived value was found to 
mediate the relationship between enjoyment and behavioral intention, while 
perceived behavioral control play a mediation role in the relationship between 
social influence and behavioral intention. In conclusion, this study highlights 
the variables that influence the acceptance of AI-augmented design and provides 
valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of integrating AI 
technologies in design. The proposed acceptance model serves as a framework for 
future research in this area and can guide the development of more user-friendly 
and effective AI-augmented design tools and technologies.

New infrastructure construction stemming from the new waves of technological 
revolution worldwide is exemplified by 5G base stations, big data centers, and 
ultra-high voltage. It has aroused extensive academic and policy interests in 
recent years, especially due to its beneficial role in empowering regional novel 
economic dynamics. However, this argument is still too general to capture the 
nuanced effects of new infrastructure construction on fostering emerging 
industries in specific spatial-temporal and industrial contexts, which is left 
for geographers to take up. This paper focuses on the spatial-temporally and 
industrially heterogeneous effects of new infrastructure construction on 
fostering four distinctive emerging industries in major Chinese cities over the 
last decade. It reveals that new infrastructure construction and emerging 
industries have experienced rapid development in major Chinese cities, with 
geographical agglomeration in national central cities with advanced economic 
development level. It is empirically demonstrated that new infrastructure 
construction can facilitate the development of emerging industries in major 
Chinese cities, while significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity characterizes 
the contributory forces. Furthermore, artificial intelligence as a Key Enabling 
Technology, robotics as a kind of hardware-featured industry, 
software-as-a-service as a software-centered industry, and blockchain as a 
networking-oriented industry vary markedly in the extent and the ways in which 
they benefit from new infrastructure construction, and they consequently exhibit 
industrial sensitivity to spatial-temporal heterogeneity in the fostering 
effects.

BACKGROUND: and Purpose: Enhancing patient satisfaction remains crucial for 
healthcare quality. The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in the 
Internet of Health Things (loHT) can streamline the medical examination process. 
Most Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) examinations are non-invasive and 
contribute significantly to patient satisfaction. Our aim was to establish an 
intelligent physical examination system that amalgamates TCM and Western 
medicine and to conduct a preliminary investigation into its effectiveness in 
enhancing the satisfaction of patients with chronic diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experts from clinical departments, the equipment 
department, and the software development department were invited to participate 
in group discussions to determine the design principles and organizational 
structure of the intelligent physical examination system. This system integrates 
TCM and Western medicine. We compared the satisfaction levels of patients 
examined using the intelligent physical examination system with those examined 
using the traditional medical examination system.
RESULTS: An intelligent physical examination system, combining TCM and Western 
medicine, was developed. A total of 106 patients were finally enrolled 
(intelligent group vs. control group) to evaluate satisfaction. There were no 
statistically significant differences between the intelligent group and the 
control group in age, gender, education, or income level. We identified 
significant differences in five aspects of satisfaction: 1) the physical 
examination environment; 2) the attitude and responsiveness of doctors; 3) the 
attitude and responsiveness of nurses; 4) the effectiveness of obtaining 
results; and 5) the information regarding physical examination and medical 
advice (p < 0.05). Furthermore, these differences remained statistically 
significant even after adjusting for age, gender, education, and income level.
CONCLUSIONS: The intelligent physical examination system effectively capitalized 
on the advantages of combining AI with the integration of TCM and Western 
medicine, substantially optimizing the medical examination process. In 
comparison to the traditional physical examination system, the intelligent 
system significantly enhanced patient satisfaction. Future improvements could 
involve integrating chronic disease follow-up technology into the system.

Breast cancer has the highest incidence and second-highest mortality rate among 
all cancers. The management of breast cancer is being revolutionized by 
artificial intelligence (AI), which is improving early detection, pathological 
diagnosis, risk assessment, individualized treatment recommendations, and 
treatment response prediction. Nuclear medicine has used artificial intelligence 
(AI) for over 50 years, but more recent advances in machine learning (ML) and 
deep learning (DL) have given AI in nuclear medicine additional capabilities. AI 
accurately analyzes breast imaging scans for early detection, minimizing false 
negatives while offering radiologists reliable, swift image processing 
assistance. It smoothly fits into radiology workflows, which may result in early 
treatments and reduced expenditures. In pathological diagnosis, artificial 
intelligence improves the quality of diagnostic data by ensuring accurate 
diagnoses, lowering inter-observer variability, speeding up the review process, 
and identifying errors or poor slides. By taking into consideration nutritional, 
genetic, and environmental factors, providing individualized risk assessments, 
and recommending more regular tests for higher-risk patients, AI aids with the 
risk assessment of breast cancer. The integration of clinical and genetic data 
into individualized treatment recommendations by AI facilitates collaborative 
decision-making and resource allocation optimization while also enabling patient 
progress monitoring, drug interaction consideration, and alignment with clinical 
guidelines. AI is used to analyze patient data, imaging, genomic data, and 
pathology reports in order to forecast how a treatment would respond. These 
models anticipate treatment outcomes, make sure that clinical recommendations 
are followed, and learn from historical data. The implementation of AI in 
medicine is hampered by issues with data quality, integration with healthcare IT 
systems, data protection, bias reduction, and ethical considerations, 
necessitating transparency and constant surveillance. Protecting patient 
privacy, resolving biases, maintaining transparency, identifying fault for 
mistakes, and ensuring fair access are just a few examples of ethical 
considerations. To preserve patient trust and address the effect on the 
healthcare workforce, ethical frameworks must be developed. The amazing 
potential of AI in the treatment of breast cancer calls for careful examination 
of its ethical and practical implications. We aim to review the comprehensive 
role of artificial intelligence in breast cancer management.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality in the trauma setting, and both prediction and prevention of VTE have 
long been a concern for healthcare providers in orthopedic surgery. The purpose 
of this study was to evaluate the use of novel statistical analysis and 
machine-learning in predicting the risk of VTE and the usefulness of prophylaxis 
following ankle fractures.
METHODS: The medical profiles of 16,421 patients with ankle fractures were 
screened retrospectively for symptomatic VTE. In total, 238 patients sustaining 
either surgical or nonsurgical treatment for ankle fracture with subsequently 
confirmed VTE within 180 days following the injury were placed in the case 
group. Alternatively, 937 patients who sustained ankle fractures managed 
similarly but had no documented evidence of VTE were randomly chosen as the 
control group. Individuals from both the case and control populations were also 
divided into those who had received VTE prophylaxis and those who had not. Over 
110 variables were included. Conventional statistics and machine learning 
methods were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Patients who had a motor vehicle accident, surgical treatment, 
increased hospital stay, and were on warfarin were shown to have a higher 
incidence of VTE, whereas patients who were on statins had a lower incidence of 
VTE. The highest Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (AUROC) 
showing the performance of our machine learning approach was 0.88 with 0.94 
sensitivity and 0.36 specificity. The most balanced performance was seen in a 
model that was trained using selected variables with 0.86 AUROC, 0.75 
sensitivity, and 0.85 specificity.
CONCLUSION: By using machine learning, this study successfully pinpointed 
several predictive factors linked to the occurrence or absence of VTE in 
patients who experienced an ankle fracture. Training these algorithms using 
larger, more granular, and multicentric data will further increase their 
validity and reliability and should be considered the standard for the 
development of such algorithms.

We investigate the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT, an artificial 
intelligence model developed by OpenAI, in providing nutritional information for 
dietary planning and weight management. The results have a reasonable level of 
accuracy, with energy values having the highest level of conformity: 97% of the 
artificial intelligence values fall within a 40% difference from United States 
Department of Agriculture data. Additionally, ChatGPT displayed consistency in 
its provision of nutritional data, as indicated by relatively low coefficient of 
variation values for each nutrient. The artificial intelligence model also 
proved efficient in generating a daily meal plan within a specified caloric 
limit, with all the meals falling within a 30% bound of the United States 
Department of Agriculture's caloric values. These findings suggest that ChatGPT 
can provide reasonably accurate and consistent nutritional information. Further 
research is recommended to assess the model's performance across a broader range 
of foods and meals.<END ABSTRACT>.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite the high efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), 
approximately 1-3% of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients fail to achieve a 
sustained virological response. We conducted a nationwide study to investigate 
risk factors associated with DAA treatment failure. Machine-learning algorithms 
have been applied to discriminate subjects who may fail to respond to DAA 
therapy.
METHODS: We analyzed the Taiwan HCV Registry Program database to explore 
predictors of DAA failure in HCV patients. Fifty-five host and virological 
features were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, decision tree, 
random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural 
network. The primary outcome was undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after the end 
of treatment.
RESULTS: The training (n=23,955) and validation (n=10,346) datasets had similar 
baseline demographics, with an overall DAA failure rate of 1.6% (n=538). 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that liver cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, poor DAA adherence, and higher hemoglobin A1c were 
significantly associated with virological failure. XGBoost outperformed the 
other algorithms and logistic regression models, with an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 1.000 in the training dataset and 0.803 in the 
validation dataset. The top five predictors of treatment failure were HCV RNA, 
body mass index, α-fetoprotein, platelets, and FIB-4 index. The accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive 
value of the XGBoost model (cutoff value=0.5) were 99.5%, 69.7%, 99.9%, 97.4%, 
and 99.5%, respectively, for the entire dataset.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms effectively provide risk stratification 
for DAA failure and additional information on the factors associated with DAA 
failure.

100191, China.

Pneumoconiosis is the occupational disease with the highest burden in China 
currently. The diagnosis of pneumoconiosis mainly relies on manual reading of 
X-ray high-kilovoltage or digital photography chest radiograph, which has some 
problems such as low efficiency, strong subjectivity, and cannot accurately 
judge the critical lesions. With the progress of machine-aided diagnosis 
technology, the efficient, objective and quantitative of artificial intelligence 
diagnosis technology just solve the shortcomings above. This paper reviews the 
research progress in digital chest radiography diagnosis of pneumoconiosis using 
artificial intelligence technology, especially deep learning model, combined 
with the limitations of conventional manual reading, in order to clarify the 
application prospect of artificial intelligence technology in the diagnosis of 
pneumoconiosis by digital chest radiography, and provide a direction for future 
research in this field.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our life, including the 
medical field. Repeated machine learning using big data made various fields more 
predictable and accurate. In medicine, IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), trained by 
Memorial Slone Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), was first introduced and applied 
in 14 countries worldwide.Our study was designed to assess the feasibility of 
WFO in actual clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the concordance rate 
between WFO and multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) in Urologic cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively collected data for 
consecutive patients who underwent WFO and MTB simultaneously in the diagnosis 
of urologic malignancy before determining further treatment between August 2017 
and September 2020. We compared the recommendation of the AI system, WFO (IBM 
Watson Health, Cambridge, MA), with the opinion of MTB for further managing all 
patients diagnosed with urologic malignancies such as prostate, bladder, and 
kidney cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled in our study. The number of 
patients with prostate cancer was 48. The number of bladder and kidney cancer 
patients was 5 and 2, respectively. The overall concordance rate between WFO and 
MTB was 92.7%. Three patients could not suggest proper treatment options using 
WFO, and the recommended choice of WFO was not feasible in the Korean Health 
Insurance Review and Assessment Service.
CONCLUSIONS: The decision of WFO showed a high concordance rate with a 
multidisciplinary tumor board for urologic oncology. However, some 
recommendations of WFO were not feasible in actual practice, and WFO still has 
some points to improve and modify. Interestingly, applying WFO is likely to 
facilitate a multidisciplinary team approach.

Variability in exercise is linked to improved age-related dysfunctions: A 
potential role for the constrained-disorder principle-based second-generation 
artificial intelligence system.

Ilan Y.

Objective: Regular physical activity (PA) promotes mental and physical health. 
Nevertheless, inactivity is a worldwide pandemic, and methods to augment 
exercise benefits are required. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) 
characterizes biological systems based on their inherent variability. We aimed 
to investigate the association between intra-individual variability in PA and 
disability among non-athlete adults. Methods: In this retrospective analysis of 
the longitudinal SHARE survey, we included non-disabled adults aged >50 with at 
least six visits over 14 years. Self-reported PA frequency was documented bi- to 
triennially. Low PA intensity was defined as vigorous PA frequency less than 
once a week. Stable PA was described as an unchanged PA intensity in all 
consecutive middle observations. The primary outcome was defined as a physical 
limitation in everyday activities at the end of the survey. Secondary outcomes 
were cognitive functions, including short-term memory, long-term memory, and 
verbal fluency. Results: The study included 2,049 non-disabled adults with a 
mean age of 53 and 49.1% women. In the initially high PA intensity group, 
variability in PA was associated with increased physical disability prevalence 
(23.3% vs. 33.2%, stable vs. unstable PA ; P<0.01; adjusted P<0.01). In the 
initially low PA intensity group, variability was associated with a reduced 
physical disability (45.6% vs. 33.3%, stable vs. unstable PA ; P=0.02; adjusted 
P=0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in cognitive 
parameters between the groups. Among individuals with the same low PA intensity 
at the beginning and end of follow-up, variability was associated with reduced 
physical disability (56.9% vs. 36.5%, stable vs. unstable PA ; P=0.02; adjusted 
P=0.04) and improved short-term memory (score change: -0.28 vs. +0.29, stable 
vs. unstable PA ; P=0.05). Conclusion: Incorporating variability into PA 
regimens of inactive adults may enhance their physical and cognitive benefits.

PerSEveML: A Web-Based Tool to Identify Persistent Biomarker Structure for Rare 
Events Using Integrative Machine Learning Approach.

Dutta S, Mudaranthakam DP, Li Y, Sardiu ME.

Omics datasets often pose a computational challenge due to their high 
dimensionality, large size, and non-linear structures. Analyzing these datasets 
becomes especially daunting in the presence of rare events. Machine learning 
(ML) methods have gained traction for analyzing rare events, yet there remains a 
limited exploration of bioinformatics tools that integrate ML techniques to 
comprehend the underlying biology. Expanding upon our previously developed 
computational framework of an integrative machine learning approach 1 , we 
introduce PerSEveML, an interactive web-based that uses crowd-sourced 
intelligence to predict rare events and determine feature selection structures. 
PerSEveML provides a comprehensive overview of the integrative approach through 
evaluation metrics that help users understand the contribution of individual ML 
methods to the prediction process. Additionally, PerSEveML calculates entropy 
and rank scores, which visually organize input features into a persistent 
structure of selected, unselected, and fluctuating categories that help 
researchers uncover meaningful hypotheses regarding the underlying biology. We 
have evaluated PerSEveML on three diverse biologically complex data sets with 
extremely rare events from small to large scale and have demonstrated its 
ability to generate valid hypotheses. PerSEveML is available at 
https://biostats-shinyr.kumc.edu/PerSEveML/ and

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service 
(EIS) is a fellowship in applied epidemiology for physicians, veterinarians, 
nurses, scientists, and other health professionals. Each EIS fellow is assigned 
to a position at a federal, state, or local site for 2 years of on-the-job 
training in outbreak investigation, epidemiologic research, surveillance system 
evaluation, and scientific communication. Although the original focus of the 
program on the control of infectious diseases remains salient, positions are 
available for training in other areas of public health, including occupational 
respiratory disease. In this Perspective, we describe the EIS program, highlight 
three positions (one federal and two state-based) that provide training in 
occupational respiratory epidemiology, and summarize trainees' experiences in 
these positions over a 30-year period. For early-career health professionals 
interested in understanding and preventing occupational respiratory hazards and 
diseases, EIS offers a unique career development opportunity.

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare 
and daily life, offering great opportunities but also posing ethical and 
societal challenges. To ensure AI benefits all individuals, including those with 
intellectual disabilities, the focus should be on adaptive technology that can 
adapt to the unique needs of the user. Biomedical engineers have an 
interdisciplinary background that helps them to lead multidisciplinary teams in 
the development of human-centered AI solutions. These solutions can personalize 
learning, enhance communication, and improve accessibility for individuals with 
intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, AI can aid in healthcare research, 
diagnostics, and therapy. The ethical use of AI in healthcare and the 
collaboration of AI with human expertise must be emphasized. Public funding for 
inclusive research is encouraged, promoting equity and economic growth while 
empowering those with intellectual disabilities in society.

INTRODUCTION: The development of costs-effective and sensitive screening 
solutions to prevent amblyopia and identify its risk factors (strabismus, 
refractive problems or mixed) is a significant priority of pediatric 
ophthalmology. The main objective of our study was to compare the classification 
performance of various vision screening tests, including classic, 
stereoacuity-based tests (Lang II, TNO, Stereo Fly, and Frisby), and 
non-stereoacuity-based, low-density static, dynamic, and noisy anaglyphic random 
dot stereograms. We determined whether the combination of non-stereoacuity-based 
tests integrated in the simplest artificial intelligence (AI) model could be an 
alternative method for vision screening.
METHODS: Our study, conducted in Spain and Hungary, is a non-experimental, 
cross-sectional diagnostic test assessment focused on pediatric eye conditions. 
Using convenience sampling, we enrolled 423 children aged 3.6-14 years, 
diagnosed with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors, and compared them to 
age-matched emmetropic controls. Comprehensive pediatric ophthalmologic 
examinations ascertained diagnoses. Participants used filter glasses for 
stereovision tests and red-green goggles for an AI-based test over their 
prescribed glasses. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) were our metrics, with sensitivity being the primary endpoint. AUCs were 
analyzed using DeLong's method, and binary classifications (pathologic vs. 
normal) were evaluated using McNemar's matched pair and Fisher's nonparametric 
tests.
RESULTS: Four non-overlapping groups were studied: (1) amblyopia (n = 46), (2) 
amblyogenic (n = 55), (3) non-amblyogenic (n = 128), and (4) emmetropic 
(n = 194), and a fifth group that was a combination of the amblyopia and 
amblyogenic groups. Based on AUCs, the AI combination of non-stereoacuity-based 
tests showed significantly better performance 0.908, 95% CI: (0.829-0.958) for 
detecting amblyopia and its risk factors than most classical tests: Lang II: 
0.704, (0.648-0.755), Stereo Fly: 0.780, (0.714-0.837), Frisby: 0.754 
(0.688-0.812), p < 0.02, n = 91, DeLong's method). At the optimum ROC point, 
McNemar's test indicated significantly higher sensitivity in accord with AUCs. 
Moreover, the AI solution had significantly higher sensitivity than TNO 
(p = 0.046, N = 134, Fisher's test), as well, while the specificity did not 
differ.
DISCUSSION: The combination of multiple tests utilizing anaglyphic random dot 
stereograms with varying parameters (density, noise, dynamism) in AI leads to 
the most advanced and sensitive screening test for identifying amblyopia and 
amblyogenic conditions compared to all the other tests studied.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the value of an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-assisted diagnostic system in the prediction of pulmonary nodules.
METHODS: The AI system was able to make predictions of benign or malignant 
nodules. 260 cases of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) were divided into 173 
malignant cases and 87 benign cases based on the surgical pathological 
diagnosis. A stratified data analysis was applied to compare the diagnostic 
effectiveness of the AI system to distinguish between the subgroups with 
different clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: The accuracy of AI system in judging benignity and malignancy of the 
nodules was 75.77% (p < 0.05). We created an ROC curve by calculating the true 
positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold 
values, and the AUC was 0.755. Results of the stratified analysis were as 
follows. (1) By nodule position: the AUC was 0.677, 0.758, 0.744, 0.982, and 
0.725, respectively, for the nodules in the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, 
right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. (2) By nodule size: 
the AUC was 0.778, 0.771, and 0.686, respectively, for the nodules measuring 
5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 mm in diameter. (3) The predictive accuracy was higher 
for the subsolid pulmonary nodules than for the solid ones (80.54 vs. 66.67%).
CONCLUSION: The AI system can be applied to assist in the prediction of benign 
and malignant pulmonary nodules. It can provide a valuable reference, especially 
for the diagnosis of subsolid nodules and small nodules measuring 5-10 mm in 
diameter.

AIMS: Patients presenting symptoms of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) are not a homogenous population. Different phenotypes can 
differ in prognosis and optimal management strategies. We sought to identify 
phenotypes of HFpEF by using the medical information database from a large 
university hospital centre using machine learning.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We explored the use of clinical variables from electronic 
health records in addition to echocardiography to identify different phenotypes 
of patients with HFpEF. The proposed methodology identifies four phenotypic 
clusters based on both clinical and echocardiographic characteristics, which 
have differing prognoses (death and cardiovascular hospitalization).
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrated that artificial intelligence-derived 
phenotypes could be used as a tool for physicians to assess risk and to target 
therapies that may improve outcomes.

Bard Versus the 2022 American Society of Plastic Surgeons In-Service 
Examination: Performance on the Examination in Its Intern Year.

Najafali D, Reiche E, Araya S, Camacho JM, Liu FC, Johnstone T, Patel SA, 
Morrison SD, Dorafshar AH, Fox PM.

BACKGROUND: Bard is a conversational generative artificial intelligence (AI) 
platform released by Google (Mountain View, CA) to the public in May 2023.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the performance of Bard on the American 
Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) In-Service Examination to compare it to 
residents' performance nationally. We hypothesized that Bard would perform best 
on the comprehensive and core surgical principles portions of the examination.
METHODS: Google's 2023 Bard was used to answer questions from the 2022 ASPS 
In-Service Examination. Each question was asked as written with the stem and 
multiple-choice options. The 2022 ASPS Norm Table was utilized to compare Bard's 
performance to that of subgroups of plastic surgery residents.
RESULTS: A total of 231 questions were included. Bard answered 143 questions 
correctly corresponding to an accuracy of 62%. The highest-performing section 
was the comprehensive portion (73%). When compared with integrated residents 
nationally, Bard scored in the 74th percentile for post-graduate year (PGY)-1, 
34th percentile for PGY-2, 20th percentile for PGY-3, 8th percentile for PGY-4, 
1st percentile for PGY-5, and 2nd percentile for PGY-6.
CONCLUSIONS: Bard outperformed more than half of the first-year integrated 
residents (74th percentile). Its best sections were the comprehensive and core 
surgical principle portions of the examination. Further analysis of the 
chatbot's incorrect questions might help improve the overall quality of the 
examination's questions.

Network pharmacology (NP) provides a new methodological perspective for 
understanding traditional medicine from a holistic perspective, giving rise to 
frontiers such as traditional Chinese medicine network pharmacology (TCM-NP). 
With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it is key for 
NP to develop network-based AI methods to reveal the treatment mechanism of 
complex diseases from massive omics data. In this review, focusing on the 
TCM-NP, we summarize involved AI methods into three categories: network 
relationship mining, network target positioning and network target navigating, 
and present the typical application of TCM-NP in uncovering biological basis and 
clinical value of Cold/Hot syndromes. Collectively, our review provides 
researchers with an innovative overview of the methodological progress of NP and 
its application in TCM from the AI perspective.

The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the main constituent elements 
of text generated by ChatGPT in response to questions on an emerging topic in 
the academic literature in Portuguese - health literacy - and discuss how the 
evidence produced can contribute to improving our understanding of the limits 
and challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing. We 
conducted an exploratory descriptive study based on responses to five 
consecutive questions in Portuguese and English with increasing levels of 
complexity put to ChatGPT. Our findings reveal the potential of the use of 
widely available, unrestricted access AI-based technologies like ChatGPT for 
academic writing. Featuring a simple and intuitive interface, the tool generated 
structured and coherent text using natural-like language. Considering that 
academic productivism is associated with a growing trend in professional 
misconduct, especially plagiarism, there is a need too take a careful look at 
academic writing and scientific knowledge dissemination processes mediated by AI 
technologies.

The development of accurate and interpretable models for predicting reaction 
constants of organic compounds with hydroxyl radicals is vital for advancing 
quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in pollutant degradation. 
Methods like molecular descriptors, molecular fingerprinting, and group 
contribution methods have limitations, as traditional machine learning struggles 
to capture all intramolecular information simultaneously. To address this, we 
established an integrated graph neural network (GNN) with approximately 12 
million learnable parameters. GNN represents atoms as nodes and chemical bonds 
as edges, thus transforming molecules into a graph structures, effectively 
capturing microscopic properties while depicting atom connectivity in 
non-Euclidean space. Our datasets comprise 1401 pollutants to develop an 
integrated GNN model with Bayesian optimization, the model achieves root mean 
square errors of 0.165, 0.172, and 0.189 on the training, validation, and test 
datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we assess molecular structure similarity 
using molecular fingerprint to enhance the model's applicability. Afterwards, we 
propose a gradient weight mapping method for model explainability, uncovering 
the key functional groups in chemical reactions in artificial intelligence 
perspective, which would boost chemistry through artificial intelligence extreme 
arithmetic power.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental noise is increasing in recent years but 
most of the previous literature in children has evaluated the effect of aircraft 
noise exposure at schools on cognition.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether residential exposure to road traffic noise during 
pregnancy and childhood is associated with cognitive and motor function in 
children and preadolescents.
METHODS: The study involved 619 participants from the Spanish INMA-Sabadell 
cohort and 7,115 from the Dutch Generation R Study. We used noise maps to 
estimate the average day-evening-night road traffic noise levels at each 
participant's residential address during pregnancy and childhood periods. 
Validated tests were administered throughout childhood in both cohorts to assess 
non-verbal and verbal intelligence, memory, processing speed, attentional 
function, working memory, cognitive flexibility, risky decision-making, and fine 
and gross motor function. Linear models, linear mixed models, and negative 
binomial models were run depending on the outcome in cohort-specific analysis 
and combined with a random-effects meta-analysis. All models were adjusted for 
several socioeconomic and lifestyle variables and results corrected for multiple 
testing.
RESULTS: Average road traffic noise exposure levels during pregnancy and 
childhood were 61.3 (SD 6.0) and 61.5 (SD 5.4) dB for the INMA-Sabadell cohort 
and 54.6 (SD 7.9) and 53.5 (SD 6.5) dB for the Generation R Study, respectively. 
Road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy and childhood was not related to 
any of the cognitive and motor function outcomes examined in this study (e.g. 
-0.92 (95 % CI -2.08; 0.24) and 0.20 (95 % CI -0.96; 1.35) in overall estimates 
of memory and fine motor function, respectively, when road traffic noise 
increases by 10 dB during childhood).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that child's cognitive or motor functions 
are not affected by residential exposure to road traffic noise. However, more 
studies evaluating this association at school and home settings as well as noise 
events are needed.

One of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence is automated 
scientific discovery based on previously amassed data, coupled with restrictions 
provided by known physical principles, including symmetries and conservation 
laws. Such automated hypothesis creation and verification can assist scientists 
in studying complex phenomena, where traditional physical intuition may fail. 
Here we develop a platform based on a generalized Onsager principle to learn 
macroscopic dynamical descriptions of arbitrary stochastic dissipative systems 
directly from observations of their microscopic trajectories. Our method 
simultaneously constructs reduced thermodynamic coordinates and interprets the 
dynamics on these coordinates. We demonstrate its effectiveness by studying 
theoretically and validating experimentally the stretching of long polymer 
chains in an externally applied field. Specifically, we learn three 
interpretable thermodynamic coordinates and build a dynamical landscape of 
polymer stretching, including the identification of stable and transition states 
and the control of the stretching rate. Our general methodology can be used to 
address a wide range of scientific and technological applications.

In this study, we developed an AI-based real-time motion feedback system for 
patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) during rehabilitation, aiming to enhance 
their interest and motivation. The effectiveness of the system in improving 
upper-limb muscle strength during the Thera band exercises was evaluated. The 
motion analysis program, including exercise repetition counts and calorie 
consumption, was developed using MediaPipe, focusing on three key motions (chest 
press, shoulder press, and arm curl) for upper extremity exercises. The 
participants with SCI were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG = 4) 
or control group (CG = 5), engaging in 1 h sessions three times a week for 8 
weeks. Muscle strength tests (chest press, shoulder press, lat pull-down, and 
arm curl) were performed before and after exercises. Although both groups did 
not show significant differences, the EG group exhibited increased strength in 
all measured variables, whereas the CG group showed constant or reduced results. 
Consequently, the computer program-based system developed in this study could be 
effective in muscle strengthening. Furthermore, these findings may serve as a 
valuable foundation for future AI-driven rehabilitation exercise systems.

BACKGROUND: Caring behavior is a major focus of the nursing profession and an 
important dimension of nursing practice that sets nurses apart from other 
healthcare professionals. Effective patient-centered care requires ensuring 
nurses have the emotional intelligence and happiness to address the daily 
demands of practice. The purpose of this study is to examine the emotional 
intelligence and happiness among nursing students and their relationship with 
caring behaviors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study was conducted on 
nursing students (n = 363) from Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, via an online 
survey. Measures include demographic data survey, Oxford Happiness 
Questionnaire, Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, and Caring Behaviors 
Inventory scale. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted for 
this study.
RESULTS: Nursing students reported their highest degree of caring was in terms 
of 'respectful differences to others', while their lowest was in 'knowledge and 
skills'. Emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of 
caring behaviors and explained the variance in assurance of human presence 
(17.5%), knowledge and skills (17.5%), respectful differences to others (18%), 
and positive connectedness (12.9%). In the final regression model, emotional 
intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and 
explained 19.5% of the variance.
CONCLUSIONS: Emotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students were 
found to be important factors to improve their caregiving behaviors. Therefore, 
nursing educators should consider integrating emotional intelligence and 
happiness interventions for students into their curriculum.

On a global scale, food safety and security aspects entail consideration 
throughout the farm-to-fork continuum, considering food's supply chain. 
Generally, the agrifood system is a multiplex network of interconnected features 
and processes, with a hard predictive rate, where maintaining the food's safety 
is an indispensable element and is part of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). It has led the scientific community to develop advanced applied 
analytical methods, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) 
techniques applied for assessing foodborne diseases. The main objective of this 
paper is to contribute to the development of the consensus version of ongoing 
research about the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the 
domain of food-crop safety from an analytical point of view. Writing a 
comprehensive review for a more specific topic can also be challenging, 
especially when searching within the literature. To our knowledge, this review 
is the first to address this issue. This work consisted of conducting a unique 
and exhaustive study of the literature, using our TriScope Keywords-based 
Synthesis methodology. All available literature related to our topic was 
investigated according to our criteria of inclusion and exclusion. The final 
count of data papers was subject to deep reading and analysis to extract the 
necessary information to answer our research questions. Although many studies 
have been conducted, limited attention has been paid to outlining the 
applications of AI tools combined with analytical strategies for crop-based food 
safety specifically.

A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a tangle of abnormal blood 
vessels that irregularly connects arteries and veins. Stereotactic radiosurgery 
(SRS) has been shown to be an effective treatment for AVM patients, but the 
factors associated with AVM obliteration remains a matter of debate. In this 
study, we aimed to develop a model that can predict whether patients with AVM 
will be cured 36 months after intervention by means of SRS and identify the most 
important predictors that explain the probability of being cured. A machine 
learning (ML) approach was applied using decision tree (DT) and logistic 
regression (LR) techniques on historical data (sociodemographic, clinical, 
treatment, angioarchitecture, and radiosurgery procedure) of 202 patients with 
AVM who underwent SRS at the Instituto de Radiocirugía del Perú (IRP) between 
2005 and 2018. The LR model obtained the best results for predicting AVM cure 
with an accuracy of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.93, specificity of 0.89, and an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.98, which shows that ML models are suitable for 
predicting the prognosis of medical conditions such as AVM and can be a support 
tool for medical decision-making. In addition, several factors were identified 
that could explain whether patients with AVM would be cured at 36 months with 
the highest likelihood: the location of the AVM, the occupation of the patient, 
and the presence of hemorrhage.

DUS measurements for popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) specifically can be 
time-consuming, error-prone, and operator-dependent. To eliminate this 
subjectivity and provide efficient segmentation, we applied artificial 
intelligence (AI) to accurately delineate inner and outer lumen on DUS. DUS 
images were selected from a cohort of patients with PAAs from a 
multi-institutional platform. Encord is an easy-to-use, readily available online 
AI platform that was used to segment both the inner lumen and outer lumen of the 
PAA on DUS images. A model trained on 20 images and tested on 80 images had a 
mean Average Precision of 0.85 for the outer polygon and 0.23 for the inner 
polygon. The outer polygon had a higher recall score than precision score at 
0.90 and 0.85, respectively. The inner polygon had a score of 0.25 for both 
precision and recall. The outer polygon false-negative rate was the lowest in 
images with the least amount of blur. This study demonstrates the feasibility of 
using the widely available Encord AI platform to identify standard features of 
PAAs that are critical for operative decision making.

We previously reported on 'Tear Film Oriented Diagnosis' (TFOD), a method for 
the dry eye (DE) subtype classification using fluorescein staining and an 
examination of fluorescein breakup patterns via slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Here, 
we report 'AI-supported TFOD', a novel non-invasive method for DE subtype 
classification using videokeratography (VK) and "Blur Value" (BV), a new VK 
indicator of the extent of blur in Meyer-ring images and deep learning (DL). 
This study involved 243 eyes of 243 DE cases (23 males and 220 females; mean 
age: 64.4 ± 13.9 (SD) years)-i.e., 31 severe aqueous-deficient DE (sADDE) cases, 
73 mild-to-moderate ADDE (m/mADDE) cases, 84 decreased wettability DE (DWDE) 
cases, and 55 increased evaporation DE (IEDE) cases diagnosed via the 
fluorescein-supported TFOD pathway. For DL, a 3D convolutional neural network 
classification model was used (i.e., the original image and BV data of eyes kept 
open for 7 s were randomly divided into training data (146 cases) and the test 
data (97 cases), with the training data increased via data augmentation and 
corresponding to 2628 cases). Overall, the DE classification accuracy was 
78.40%, and the accuracies for the subtypes sADDE, m/mADDE, DWDE, and IEDE were 
92.3%, 79.3%, 75.8%, and 72.7%, respectively. 'AI-supported TFOD' may become a 
useful tool for DE subtype classification.

Several studies have demonstrated a critical association between cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and mental health, revealing that approximately one-third of 
individuals with CVD also experience depression. This comorbidity significantly 
increases the risk of cardiac complications and mortality, a risk that persists 
regardless of traditional factors. Addressing this issue, our study pioneers a 
straightforward, explainable, and data-driven pipeline for predicting depression 
in CVD patients.
METHODS: Our study was conducted at a cardiac surgical intensive care unit. A 
total of 224 participants who were scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass 
graft surgery (CABG) were enrolled in the study. Prior to surgery, each patient 
underwent psychiatric evaluation to identify major depressive disorder (MDD) 
based on the DSM-5 criteria. An advanced data curation workflow was applied to 
eliminate outliers and inconsistencies and improve data quality. An explainable 
AI-empowered pipeline was developed, where sophisticated machine learning 
techniques, including the AdaBoost, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms, were 
trained and tested on the curated data based on a stratified cross-validation 
approach.
RESULTS: Our findings identified a significant correlation between the biomarker 
"sRAGE" and depression (r = 0.32, p = 0.038). Among the applied models, the 
random forest classifier demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting 
depression, with notable scores in accuracy (0.62), sensitivity (0.71), 
specificity (0.53), and area under the curve (0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides compelling evidence that depression in CVD 
patients, particularly those with elevated "sRAGE" levels, can be predicted with 
a 62% accuracy rate. Our AI-driven approach offers a promising way for early 
identification and intervention, potentially revolutionizing care strategies in 
this vulnerable population.

(1) Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing challenge, both for patients 
and physicians, in order to control the impact on health and prevent 
complications. Millions of patients with diabetes require medical attention, 
which generates problems regarding the limited time for screening but also 
addressability difficulties for consultation and management. As a result, 
screening programs for vision-threatening complications due to DM have to be 
more efficient in the future in order to cope with such a great healthcare 
burden. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of DM that can be 
prevented if it is timely screened with the help of optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) devices. Newly developing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) 
algorithms can assist physicians in analyzing large datasets and flag potential 
risks. By using AI algorithms in order to process OCT images of large 
populations, the screening capacity and speed can be increased so that patients 
can be timely treated. This quick response gives the physicians a chance to 
intervene and prevent disability. (2) Methods: This study evaluated ConvNeXt and 
EfficientNet architectures in correctly identifying DME patterns on real-life 
OCT images for screening purposes. (3) Results: Firstly, we obtained models that 
differentiate between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and healthy scans with an 
accuracy of 0.98. Secondly, we obtained a model that can indicate the presence 
of edema, detachment of the subfoveolar neurosensory retina, and hyperreflective 
foci (HF) without using pixel level annotation. Lastly, we analyzed the extent 
to which the pretrained weights on natural images "understand" OCT scans. (4) 
Conclusions: Pretrained networks such as ConvNeXt or EfficientNet correctly 
identify features relevant to the differentiation between healthy retinas and 
DR, even though they were pretrained on natural images. Another important aspect 
of our research is that the differentiation between biomarkers and their 
localization can be obtained even without pixel-level annotation. The "three 
biomarkers model" is able to identify obvious subfoveal neurosensory 
detachments, retinal edema, and hyperreflective foci, as well as very small 
subfoveal detachments. In conclusion, our study points out the possible 
usefulness of AI-assisted diagnosis of DME for lowering healthcare costs, 
increasing the quality of life of patients with diabetes, and reducing the 
waiting time until an appropriate ophthalmological consultation and treatment 
can be performed.

(1)Department of Gastroenterology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education 
and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh 160012, India.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common (90%) type of solid 
pancreatic neoplasm. Due to its late presentation and poor survival rate, early 
diagnosis and timely treatment is of utmost importance for better clinical 
outcomes. Endoscopic ultrasound provides high-resolution images of the pancreas 
and has excellent sensitivity in the diagnosis of even small (<2 cm) pancreatic 
lesions. Apart from imaging, it also has an advantage of tissue acquisition (EUS 
fine-needle aspiration, FNA; or fine-needle biopsy, FNB) for definitive 
diagnoses. EUS-guided tissue acquisition plays a crucial role in genomic and 
molecular studies, which in today's era of personalized medicine, are likely to 
become important components of PDAC management. With the use of better needle 
designs and technical advancements, EUS has now become an indispensable tool in 
the management of PDAC. Lastly, artificial intelligence for the detection of 
pancreatic lesions and newer automated needles for tissue acquisition will 
obviate observer dependency in the near future, resulting in the wider 
dissemination and adoption of this technology for improved outcomes in patients 
with PDAC.

(1)Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 22212, 
Republic of Korea.

This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of two 
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques: Kakao Brain Artificial Neural Network 
for Chest X-ray Reading (KARA-CXR), an assistive technology developed using 
large-scale AI and large language models (LLMs), and ChatGPT, a well-known LLM. 
The study was conducted to validate the performance of the two technologies in 
chest X-ray reading and explore their potential applications in the medical 
imaging diagnosis domain. The study methodology consisted of randomly selecting 
2000 chest X-ray images from a single institution's patient database, and two 
radiologists evaluated the readings provided by KARA-CXR and ChatGPT. The study 
used five qualitative factors to evaluate the readings generated by each model: 
accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and 
hallucinations. Statistical analysis showed that KARA-CXR achieved significantly 
higher diagnostic accuracy compared to ChatGPT. In the 'Acceptable' accuracy 
category, KARA-CXR was rated at 70.50% and 68.00% by two observers, while 
ChatGPT achieved 40.50% and 47.00%. Interobserver agreement was moderate for 
both systems, with KARA at 0.74 and GPT4 at 0.73. For 'False Findings', KARA-CXR 
scored 68.00% and 68.50%, while ChatGPT scored 37.00% for both observers, with 
high interobserver agreements of 0.96 for KARA and 0.97 for GPT4. In 'Location 
Inaccuracy' and 'Hallucinations', KARA-CXR outperformed ChatGPT with significant 
margins. KARA-CXR demonstrated a non-hallucination rate of 75%, which is 
significantly higher than ChatGPT's 38%. The interobserver agreement was high 
for KARA (0.91) and moderate to high for GPT4 (0.85) in the hallucination 
category. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of AI and 
large-scale language models in medical imaging and diagnostics. It also shows 
that in the chest X-ray domain, KARA-CXR has relatively higher accuracy than 
ChatGPT.

There is no well-defined threshold for intra-operative blood transfusion (BT) in 
advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) surgery. To address this, we devised a 
Machine Learning (ML)-driven prediction algorithm aimed at prompting and 
elucidating a communication alert for BT based on anticipated peri-operative 
events independent of existing BT policies. We analyzed data from 403 EOC 
patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery between 2014 and 2019. The 
estimated blood volume (EBV), calculated using the formula EBV = weight × 80, 
served for setting a 10% EBV threshold for individual intervention. Based on 
known estimated blood loss (EBL), we identified two distinct groups. The 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed satisfactory results for 
predicting events above the established threshold (AUC 0.823, 95% CI 0.76-0.88). 
Operative time (OT) was the most significant factor influencing predictions. 
Intra-operative blood loss exceeding 10% EBV was associated with OT > 250 min, 
primary surgery, serous histology, performance status 0, R2 resection and 
surgical complexity score > 4. Certain sub-procedures including large bowel 
resection, stoma formation, ileocecal resection/right hemicolectomy, mesenteric 
resection, bladder and upper abdominal peritonectomy demonstrated clear 
associations with an elevated interventional risk. Our findings emphasize the 
importance of obtaining a rough estimate of OT in advance for precise prediction 
of blood requirements.

Mismatch repair deficiency (d-MMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS, and 
BRAF mutational status are crucial for treating advanced colorectal cancer 
patients. Traditional methods like immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) can be challenged by artificial intelligence (AI) based on whole 
slide images (WSI) to predict tumor status. In this systematic review, we 
evaluated the role of AI in predicting MSI status, KRAS, and BRAF mutations in 
colorectal cancer. Studies published in PubMed up to June 2023 were included (n 
= 17), and we reported the risk of bias and the performance for each study. Some 
studies were impacted by the reduced number of slides included in the data set 
and the lack of external validation cohorts. Deep learning models for the 
d-MMR/MSI status showed a good performance in training cohorts (mean AUC = 0.89, 
[0.74-0.97]) but slightly less than expected in the validation cohort when 
available (mean AUC = 0.82, [0.63-0.98]). Contrary to the MSI status, the 
prediction of KRAS and BRAF mutations was less explored with a less robust 
methodology. The performance was lower, with a maximum of 0.77 in the training 
cohort, 0.58 in the validation cohort for KRAS, and 0.82 AUC in the training 
cohort for BRAF.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is composed of diverse hematological malignancies 
caused by dysfunctional stem cells, leading to abnormal hematopoiesis and 
cytopenia. Approximately 30% of MDS cases progress to acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML), a more aggressive disease. Early detection is crucial to intervene before 
MDS progresses to AML. The current diagnostic process for MDS involves analyzing 
peripheral blood smear (PBS), bone marrow sample (BMS), and flow cytometry (FC) 
data, along with clinical patient information, which is labor-intensive and 
time-consuming. Recent advancements in machine learning offer an opportunity for 
faster, automated, and accurate diagnosis of MDS. In this review, we aim to 
provide an overview of the current applications of AI in the diagnosis of MDS 
and highlight their advantages, disadvantages, and performance metrics.

Despite advances in diagnostic and treatment technologies, predicting outcomes 
of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a challenge. Prognostic 
models are further obscured by the variable impact of the tumor properties and 
the remaining liver parenchyma, often affected by cirrhosis or non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease that tend to precede HCC. This study investigated the 
prognostic value of reticulin and collagen microarchitecture in liver resection 
samples. We analyzed 105 scanned tissue sections that were stained using a 
Gordon and Sweet's silver impregnation protocol combined with Picric Acid-Sirius 
Red. A convolutional neural network was utilized to segment the red-staining 
collagen and black linear reticulin strands, generating a detailed map of the 
fiber structure within the HCC and adjacent liver tissue. Subsequent hexagonal 
grid subsampling coupled with automated epithelial edge detection and 
computational fiber morphometry provided the foundation for region-specific 
tissue analysis. Two penalized Cox regression models using LASSO achieved a 
concordance index (C-index) greater than 0.7. These models incorporated 
variables such as patient age, tumor multifocality, and fiber-derived features 
from the epithelial edge in both the tumor and liver compartments. The 
prognostic value at the tumor edge was derived from the reticulin structure, 
while collagen characteristics were significant at the epithelial edge of 
peritumoral liver. The prognostic performance of these models was superior to 
models solely reliant on conventional clinicopathologic parameters, highlighting 
the utility of AI-extracted microarchitectural features for the management of 
HCC.

Access to medical imaging is pivotal in healthcare, playing a crucial role in 
the prevention, diagnosis, and management of diseases. However, disparities 
persist in this scenario, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, 
racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals facing linguistic or cultural 
barriers. This paper critically assesses methods to mitigate these disparities, 
with a focus on breast cancer screening. We underscore scientific mobility as a 
vital tool for radiologists to advocate for healthcare policy changes: it not 
only enhances diversity and cultural competence within the radiology community 
but also fosters international cooperation and knowledge exchange among 
healthcare institutions. Efforts to ensure cultural competency among 
radiologists are discussed, including ongoing cultural education, sensitivity 
training, and workforce diversification. These initiatives are key to improving 
patient communication and reducing healthcare disparities. This paper also 
highlights the crucial role of policy changes and legislation in promoting equal 
access to essential screening services like mammography. We explore the 
challenges and potential of teleradiology in improving access to medical imaging 
in remote and underserved areas. In the era of artificial intelligence, this 
paper emphasizes the necessity of validating its models across a spectrum of 
populations to prevent bias and achieve equitable healthcare outcomes. Finally, 
the importance of international collaboration is illustrated, showcasing its 
role in sharing insights and strategies to overcome global access barriers in 
medical imaging. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the 
challenges related to disparities in medical imaging access and proposes 
actionable strategies to address these challenges, aiming for equitable 
healthcare delivery.

AIMS: The automation of quantitative evaluation for breast immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) plays a crucial role in reducing the workload of pathologists and 
enhancing the objectivity of diagnoses. However, current methods face challenges 
in achieving fully automated immunohistochemistry quantification due to the 
complexity of segmenting the tumor area into distinct ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS) and invasive carcinoma (IC) regions. Moreover, the quantitative analysis 
of immunohistochemistry requires a specific focus on invasive carcinoma regions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we propose an innovative approach to 
automatically identify invasive carcinoma regions in breast cancer 
immunohistochemistry whole-slide images (WSIs). Our method leverages a neural 
network that combines multi-scale morphological features with boundary features, 
enabling precise segmentation of invasive carcinoma regions without the need for 
additional H&E and P63 staining slides. In addition, we introduced an advanced 
semi-supervised learning algorithm, allowing efficient training of the model 
using unlabeled data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we 
constructed a dataset consisting of 618 IHC-stained WSIs from 170 cases, 
including four types of staining (ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67). Notably, the model 
demonstrated an impressive intersection over union (IoU) score exceeding 80% on 
the test set. Furthermore, to ascertain the practical utility of our model in 
IHC quantitative evaluation, we constructed a fully automated Ki-67 scoring 
system based on the model's predictions. Comparative experiments convincingly 
demonstrated that our system exhibited high consistency with the scores given by 
experienced pathologists.
CONCLUSIONS: Our developed model excels in accurately distinguishing between 
DCIS and invasive carcinoma regions in breast cancer immunohistochemistry WSIs. 
This method paves the way for a clinically available, fully automated 
immunohistochemistry quantitative scoring system.

BACKGROUND: The rate of concurrent endometrial cancer (EC) in atypical 
endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) can be as high as 40%. Some patient 
characteristics showed associations with this occurrence. However, their real 
predictive power with related validation has yet to be discovered. The present 
study aimed to assess the performance of various models based on patient 
characteristics in predicting EC in women with AEH.
METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-institutional study including women with 
AEH undergoing definitive surgery. The women were divided according to the final 
histology (EC vs. no-EC). The available cases were divided into a training and 
validation set. Using k-fold cross-validation, we built many predictive models, 
including regressions and artificial neural networks (ANN).
RESULTS: A total of 193/629 women (30.7%) showed EC at hysterectomy. A total of 
26/193 (13.4%) women showed high-risk EC. Regression and ANN models showed a 
prediction performance with a mean area under the curve of 0.65 and 0.75 on the 
validation set, respectively. Among the best prediction models, the most 
recurrent patient characteristics were age, body mass index, Lynch syndrome, 
diabetes, and previous breast cancer. None of these independent variables showed 
associations with high-risk diseases in women with EC.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics did not show satisfactory performance in 
predicting EC in AEH. Risk stratification in AEH based mainly on patient 
characteristics may be clinically unsuitable.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrythmia and one of the 
strongest risk factors and causal mechanisms of ischemic stroke (IS). Acute IS 
due to AF tends to be more severe than with other etiology of IS and patients 
with treated AF have reported to experience worse outcomes after endovascular 
treatment compared with patients without AF. As cardioembolism accounts for more 
than a fifth of ISs and the risk of future stroke can be mitigated with 
effective anticoagulation, which has been shown to be effective and safe in 
patients with paroxysmal or sustained AF, the screening of patients with 
cryptogenic IS (CIS) for AF is paramount. Embolic stroke of undetermined source 
(ESUS) is a subtype of CIS with a high likelihood of cardioembolism. The 
European Stroke Organization and European Society of Cardiology guidelines 
recommend at least 72 h of screening when AF is suspected. The longer the 
screening and the earlier the time point after acute IS, the more likely the AF 
paroxysm is found. Several methods are available for short-term screening of AF, 
including in-hospital monitoring and wearable electrocardiogram recorders for 
home monitoring. Implantable loop monitors provide an effective long-term method 
to screen patients with high risk of AF after IS and artificial intelligence and 
convolutional neural networks may enhance the efficacy of AF screening in the 
future. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K 
antagonists in both primary and secondary prevention of IS in AF patients. 
Recent data from the randomized controlled trials (RCT) also suggest that early 
initiation of DOAC treatment after acute IS is safe compared to later 
initiation. Anticoagulation treatment may still predispose for intracranial 
bleeding, particularly among patients with prior cerebrovascular events. Left 
atrial appendix closure offers an optional treatment choice for patients with 
prior intracranial hemorrhage and may offer an alternative to oral 
anticoagulation even for patients with IS, but these indications await 
validation in ongoing RCTs. There are still controversies related to the 
association of found AF paroxysms in CIS patients with prolonged screening, 
pertaining to the optimal duration of screening and screening strategies with 
prolonged monitoring techniques in patients with ESUS. In this review, we 
summarize the current knowledge of epidemiology, screening, and prognosis in AF 
patients with stroke.

Thyroid cancer, specifically differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), is one of 
the most prevalent endocrine malignancies worldwide. Radioactive iodine therapy 
(RAIT) using I-131 has been a standard-of-care approach for DTC due to its 
ability to ablate remnant thyroid disease following surgery, thus reducing the 
risk of recurrence. It is also used for the treatment of iodine-avid metastases. 
RAIT dosimetry can be employed to determine the optimal treatment dose of I-131 
to effectively treat cancer cells while safeguarding against undesirable 
radiation effects such as bone marrow toxicity or radiation pneumonitis. 
Conventional dosimetry protocols for RAIT, however, are complex and 
time-consuming, involving multiple days of imaging and blood sampling. This 
study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simplifying and 
optimizing RAIT. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 83 adult patients 
with DTC who underwent RAIT dosimetry at our institution between 1996 and 2023. 
The conventional MIRD-based dosimetry protocol involved imaging and blood 
sampling at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-administration of a tracer activity of 
I-131. An AI system based on a deep-learning neural network was developed to 
predict the maximum permissible activity (MPA) for RAIT using only the data 
obtained from the initial 4, 24, and 48 h time points. The AI system predicted 
the MPA values with high accuracy, showing no significant difference compared to 
the results obtained from conventional MIRD-based analysis utilizing a paired 
t-test (p = 0.351, 95% CI). The developed AI system offers the potential to 
streamline the dosimetry process, reducing the number of imaging and blood 
sampling sessions while also optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, the 
AI approach can uncover underlying relationships in data that were previously 
unknown. Our findings suggest that AI-based dosimetry may be a promising method 
for patient-specific treatment planning in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 
representing a step towards applying precision medicine for thyroid cancer. 
Further validation and implementation studies are warranted to assess the 
clinical applicability of the AI system.

Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease that can cause physical injury and 
mental disability. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but can be inconclusive due 
to the absence of initial symptoms and similarity to other dermatological 
diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used in dermatology, 
assisting clinical procedures and diagnostics. In particular, AI-supported 
solutions have been proposed in the literature to aid in the diagnosis of 
leprosy, and this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to characterize the 
state of the art. This SLR followed the preferred reporting items for systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework and was conducted in the following 
databases: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Digital Library, ISI Web of Science, 
Scopus, and PubMed. Potentially relevant research articles were retrieved. The 
researchers applied criteria to select the studies, assess their quality, and 
perform the data extraction process. Moreover, 1659 studies were retrieved, of 
which 21 were included in the review after selection. Most of the studies used 
images of skin lesions, classical machine learning algorithms, and multi-class 
classification tasks to develop models to diagnose dermatological diseases. Most 
of the reviewed articles did not target leprosy as the study's primary objective 
but rather the classification of different skin diseases (among them, leprosy). 
Although AI-supported leprosy diagnosis is constantly evolving, research in this 
area is still in its early stage, then studies are required to make AI solutions 
mature enough to be transformed into clinical practice. Expanding research 
efforts on leprosy diagnosis, coupled with the advocacy of open science in 
leveraging AI for diagnostic support, can yield robust and influential outcomes.

The aim of this validation study was to comprehensively evaluate the performance 
and generalization capability of a deep learning-based periapical lesion 
detection algorithm on a clinically representative cone-beam computed tomography 
(CBCT) dataset and test for non-inferiority. The evaluation involved 195 CBCT 
images of adult upper and lower jaws, where sensitivity and specificity metrics 
were calculated for all teeth, stratified by jaw, and stratified by tooth type. 
Furthermore, each lesion was assigned a periapical index score based on its size 
to enable a score-based evaluation. Non-inferiority tests were conducted with 
proportions of 90% for sensitivity and 82% for specificity. The algorithm 
achieved an overall sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 84.3%. The 
non-inferiority test indicated the rejection of the null hypothesis for 
specificity but not for sensitivity. However, when excluding lesions with a 
periapical index score of one (i.e., very small lesions), the sensitivity 
improved to 90.4%. Despite the challenges posed by the dataset, the algorithm 
demonstrated promising results. Nevertheless, further improvements are needed to 
enhance the algorithm's robustness, particularly in detecting very small lesions 
and the handling of artifacts and outliers commonly encountered in real-world 
clinical scenarios.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is intricately linked to obesity and diabetes, which are 
widespread risk factors. Medical imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), plays a major role in EC assessment, particularly for disease staging. 
However, the diagnostic performance of MRI exhibits variability in the detection 
of clinically relevant prognostic factors (e.g., deep myometrial invasion and 
metastatic lymph nodes assessment). To address these challenges and enhance the 
value of MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms emerge as 
promising tools with a potential to impact EC risk assessment, treatment 
planning, and prognosis prediction. These advanced post-processing techniques 
allow us to quantitatively analyse medical images, providing novel insights into 
cancer characteristics beyond conventional qualitative image evaluation. 
However, despite the growing interest and research efforts, the integration of 
radiomics and AI to EC management is still far from clinical practice and 
represents a possible perspective rather than an actual reality. This review 
focuses on the state of radiomics and AI in EC MRI, emphasizing risk 
stratification and prognostic factor prediction, aiming to illuminate potential 
advancements and address existing challenges in the field.

Brazil.

This paper presents a proposed three-step methodology designed to enhance the 
performance and efficiency of industrial systems by integrating Digital Twins 
with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms while prioritizing 
interpretability. Digital Twins are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their 
capability to offer a comprehensive virtual representation of physical systems, 
thus facilitating detailed simulations and optimizations. Concurrently, PSO has 
demonstrated its effectiveness for real-time parameter estimation, especially in 
identifying both standard and unknown components that influence the dynamics of 
a system. Our methodology, as exemplified through DC Motor and Hydraulic 
Actuator simulations, underscores the potential of Digital Twins to augment the 
self-awareness of industrial machines. The results indicate that our approach 
can proficiently optimize system parameters in real-time and unveil previously 
unknown components, thereby enhancing the adaptive capacities of the Digital 
Twin. While the reliance on accurate data to develop Digital Twin models is a 
notable consideration, the proposed methodology serves as a promising framework 
for advancing the efficiency of industrial applications. It further extends its 
relevance to fault detection and system control. Central to our approach is the 
emphasis on interpretability, ensuring a more transparent understanding and 
effective usability of such systems.

Terahertz (THz) band will play an important role in enabling sixth generation 
(6G) envisioned applications. Compared with lower frequency signals, THz waves 
are severely attenuated by the atmosphere temperature, pressure, and humidity. 
Thus, designing a THz communication system must take into account how to 
circumvent or diminish those issues to achieve a sufficient quality of service. 
Different solutions are being analyzed: intelligent communication environments, 
ubiquitous artificial intelligence, extensive network automation, and dynamic 
spectrum access, among others. This survey focuses on the benefits of 
integrating intelligent surfaces (ISs) and THz communication systems by 
providing an overview of IS in wireless communications with the scanning of the 
recent developments, a description of the architecture, and an explanation of 
the operation. The survey also covers THz channel models, differentiating them 
based on deterministic and statistical channel modeling. The IS-aided THz 
channels are elucidated at the end of the survey. Finally, discussions and 
research directions are given to help enrich the IS field of research and guide 
the reader through open issues.

Three-dimensional object modeling is necessary for developing virtual and 
augmented reality applications. Traditionally, application engineers must 
manually use art software to edit object shapes or exploit LIDAR to scan 
physical objects for constructing 3D models. This is very time-consuming and 
costly work. Fortunately, GPU recently provided a cost-effective solution for 
massive data computation. With GPU support, many studies have proposed 3D model 
generators based on different learning architectures, which can automatically 
convert 2D object pictures into 3D object models with good performance. However, 
as the demand for model resolution increases, the required computing time and 
memory space increase as significantly as the parameters of the learning 
architecture, which seriously degrades the efficiency of 3D model construction 
and the feasibility of resolution improvement. To resolve this problem, this 
paper proposes a part-oriented point cloud reconstruction framework called 
Part2Point. This framework segments the object's parts, reconstructs the point 
cloud for individual object parts, and combines the part point clouds into the 
complete object point cloud. Therefore, it can reduce the number of learning 
network parameters at the exact resolution, effectively minimizing the 
calculation time cost and the required memory space. Moreover, it can improve 
the resolution of the reconstructed point cloud so that the reconstructed model 
can present more details of object parts.

This paper studies an advanced machine learning method, specifically few-shot 
classification with meta-learning, applied to distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) 
data. The study contributes two key aspects: (i) an investigation of different 
pre-processing methods for DAS data and (ii) the implementation of a neural 
network model based on meta-learning to learn a representation of the processed 
data. In the context of urban infrastructure monitoring, we develop a few-shot 
classification framework that classifies query samples with only a limited 
number of support samples. The model consists of an embedding network trained on 
a meta dataset for feature extraction and is followed by a classifier for 
performing few-shot classification. This research thoroughly explores three 
types of data pre-processing, that is, decomposed phase, power spectral density, 
and frequency energy band, as inputs to the neural network. Experimental results 
show the efficient learning capabilities of the embedding model when working 
with various pre-processed data, offering a range of pre-processing options. 
Furthermore, the results demonstrate outstanding few-shot classification 
performance across a large number of event classes, highlighting the framework's 
potential for urban infrastructure monitoring applications.

This study is a survey of sound source localization and detection methods. The 
study provides a detailed classification of the methods used in the fields of 
science mentioned above. It classifies sound source localization systems based 
on criteria found in the literature. Moreover, an analysis of classic methods 
based on the propagation model and methods based on machine learning and deep 
learning techniques has been carried out. Attention has been paid to providing 
the most detailed information on the possibility of using physical phenomena, 
mathematical relationships, and artificial intelligence to determine sound 
source localization. Additionally, the article underscores the significance of 
these methods within both military and civil contexts. The study culminates with 
a discussion of forthcoming trends in the realms of acoustic detection and 
localization. The primary objective of this research is to serve as a valuable 
resource for selecting the most suitable approach within this domain.

Coupling brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and robotic systems in the future can 
enable seamless personal assistant systems in everyday life, with the requests 
that can be performed in a discrete manner, using one's brain activity only. 
These types of systems might be of a particular interest for people with 
locked-in syndrome (LIS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because they can 
benefit from communicating with robotic assistants using brain sensing 
interfaces. In this proof-of-concept work, we explored how a wireless and 
wearable BCI device can control a quadruped robot-Boston Dynamics' Spot. The 
device measures the user's electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography 
(EOG) activity of the user from the electrodes embedded in the glasses' frame. 
The user responds to a series of questions with YES/NO answers by performing a 
brain-teaser activity of mental calculus. Each question-answer pair has a 
pre-configured set of actions for Spot. For instance, Spot was prompted to walk 
across a room, pick up an object, and retrieve it for the user (i.e., bring a 
bottle of water) when a sequence resolved to a YES response. Our system achieved 
at a success rate of 83.4%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
integration of wireless, non-visual-based BCI systems with Spot in the context 
of personal assistant use cases. While this BCI quadruped robot system is an 
early prototype, future iterations may embody friendly and intuitive cues 
similar to regular service dogs. As such, this project aims to pave a path 
towards future developments in modern day personal assistant robots powered by 
wireless and wearable BCI systems in everyday living conditions.

The efficient use of the photovoltaic power requires a good estimation of the PV 
generation. That is why the use of good techniques for forecast is necessary. In 
this research paper, Long Short-Term Memory, Bidirectional Long Short-Term 
Memory and the Temporal convolutional network are studied in depth to forecast 
the photovoltaic power, voltage and efficiency of a 1320 Wp amorphous plant 
installed in the Technology Support Centre in the University Rey Juan Carlos, 
Madrid (Spain). The accuracy of these techniques are compared using experimental 
data along one year, applying 1 timestep or 15 min and 96 step times or 24 h, 
showing that TCN exhibits outstanding performance, compared with the two other 
techniques. For instance, it presents better results in all forecast variables 
and both forecast horizons, achieving an overall Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 
0.0024 for 15 min forecasts and 0.0058 for 24 h forecasts. In addition, the 
sensitivity analyses for the TCN technique is performed and shows that the 
accuracy is reduced as the forecast horizon increases and that the 6 months of 
dataset is sufficient to obtain an adequate result with an MSE value of 0.0080 
and a coefficient of determination of 0.90 in the worst scenarios (24 h of 
forecast).

There is a significant risk of injury in sports and intense competition due to 
the demanding physical and psychological requirements. Hamstring strain injuries 
(HSIs) are the most prevalent type of injury among professional soccer players 
and are the leading cause of missed days in the sport. These injuries stem from 
a combination of factors, making it challenging to pinpoint the most crucial 
risk factors and their interactions, let alone find effective prevention 
strategies. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the potential of 
tools provided by artificial intelligence (AI). However, current studies 
primarily concentrate on enhancing the performance of complex machine learning 
models, often overlooking their explanatory capabilities. Consequently, medical 
teams have difficulty interpreting these models and are hesitant to trust them 
fully. In light of this, there is an increasing need for advanced injury 
detection and prediction models that can aid doctors in diagnosing or detecting 
injuries earlier and with greater accuracy. Accordingly, this study aims to 
identify the biomarkers of muscle injuries in professional soccer players 
through biomechanical analysis, employing several ML algorithms such as decision 
tree (DT) methods, discriminant methods, logistic regression, naive Bayes, 
support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble methods, 
boosted and bagged trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and XGBoost. In 
particular, XGBoost is also used to obtain the most important features. The 
findings highlight that the variables that most effectively differentiate the 
groups and could serve as reliable predictors for injury prevention are the 
maximum muscle strength of the hamstrings and the stiffness of the same muscle. 
With regard to the 35 techniques employed, a precision of up to 78% was achieved 
with XGBoost, indicating that by considering scientific evidence, suggestions 
based on various data sources, and expert opinions, it is possible to attain 
good precision, thus enhancing the reliability of the results for doctors and 
trainers. Furthermore, the obtained results strongly align with the existing 
literature, although further specific studies about this sport are necessary to 
draw a definitive conclusion.

Data scarcity is a significant obstacle for modern data science and artificial 
intelligence research communities. The fact that abundant data are a key element 
of a powerful prediction model is well known through various past studies. 
However, industrial control systems (ICS) are operated in a closed environment 
due to security and privacy issues, so collected data are generally not 
disclosed. In this environment, synthetic data generation can be a good 
alternative. However, ICS datasets have time-series characteristics and include 
features with short- and long-term temporal dependencies. In this paper, we 
propose the attention-based variational recurrent autoencoder (AVRAE) for 
generating time-series ICS data. We first extend the evidence lower bound of the 
variational inference to time-series data. Then, a recurrent 
neural-network-based autoencoder is designed to take this as the objective. 
AVRAE employs the attention mechanism to effectively learn the long-term and 
short-term temporal dependencies ICS data implies. Finally, we present an 
algorithm for generating synthetic ICS time-series data using learned AVRAE. In 
a comprehensive evaluation using the ICS dataset HAI and various performance 
indicators, AVRAE successfully generated visually and statistically plausible 
synthetic ICS data.

This work involves exploring non-invasive sensor technologies for data 
collection and preprocessing, specifically focusing on novel thermal calibration 
methods and assessing low-cost infrared radiation sensors for facial temperature 
analysis. Additionally, it investigates innovative approaches to analyzing 
acoustic signals for quantifying coughing episodes. The research integrates 
diverse data capture technologies to analyze them collectively, considering 
their temporal evolution and physical attributes, aiming to extract 
statistically significant relationships among various variables for valuable 
insights. The study delineates two distinct aspects: cough detection employing a 
microphone and a neural network, and thermal sensors employing a calibration 
curve to refine their output values, reducing errors within a specified 
temperature range. Regarding control units, the initial implementation with an 
ESP32 transitioned to a Raspberry Pi model 3B+ due to neural network integration 
issues. A comprehensive testing is conducted for both fever and cough detection, 
ensuring robustness and accuracy in each scenario. The subsequent work involves 
practical experimentation and interoperability tests, validating the proof of 
concept for each system component. Furthermore, this work assesses the technical 
specifications of the prototype developed in the preceding tasks. Real-time 
testing is performed for each symptom to evaluate the system's effectiveness. 
This research contributes to the advancement of non-invasive sensor 
technologies, with implications for healthcare applications such as remote 
health monitoring and early disease detection.

Digital health applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a promising 
opportunity to address the widening gap between available resources and mental 
health needs globally. Increasingly, passively acquired data from wearables are 
augmented with carefully selected active data from depressed individuals to 
develop Machine Learning (ML) models of depression based on mood scores. 
However, most ML models are black box in nature, and hence the outputs are not 
explainable. Depression is also multimodal, and the reasons for depression may 
vary significantly between individuals. Explainable and personalised models will 
thus be beneficial to clinicians to determine the main features that lead to a 
decline in the mood state of a depressed individual, thus enabling suitable 
personalised therapy. This is currently lacking. Therefore, this study presents 
a methodology for developing personalised and accurate Deep Learning (DL)-based 
predictive mood models for depression, along with novel methods for identifying 
the key facets that lead to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. We 
illustrate our approach by using an existing multimodal dataset containing 
longitudinal Ecological Momentary Assessments of depression, lifestyle data from 
wearables and neurocognitive assessments for 14 mild to moderately depressed 
participants over one month. We develop classification- and regression-based DL 
models to predict participants' current mood scores-a discrete score given to a 
participant based on the severity of their depressive symptoms. The models are 
trained inside eight different evolutionary-algorithm-based optimisation schemes 
that optimise the model parameters for a maximum predictive performance. A 
five-fold cross-validation scheme is used to verify the DL model's predictive 
performance against 10 classical ML-based models, with a model error as low as

Underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS) has garnered significant 
attention in recent years due to its ability to separate source signals without 
prior knowledge, even when sensors are limited. To accurately estimate the mixed 
matrix, various clustering algorithms are typically employed to enhance the 
sparsity of the mixed matrix. Traditional clustering methods require prior 
knowledge of the number of direct signal sources, while modern artificial 
intelligence optimization algorithms are sensitive to outliers, which can affect 
accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called the 
Genetic Simulated Annealing Optimization (GASA) method with Adaptive 
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering 
as initialization, named the CYYM method. This approach incorporates two key 
components: an Adaptive DBSCAN to discard noise points and identify the number 
of source signals and GASA optimization for automatic cluster center 
determination. GASA combines the global spatial search capabilities of a genetic 
algorithm (GA) with the local search abilities of a simulated annealing 
algorithm (SA). Signal simulations and experimental analysis of compressor fault 
signals demonstrate that the CYYM method can accurately calculate the mixing 
matrix, facilitating successful source signal recovery. Subsequently, we analyze 
the recovered signals using the Refined Composite Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy 
(RCMFE), which, in turn, enables effective compressor connecting rod fault 
diagnosis. This research provides a promising approach for underdetermined 
source separation and offers practical applications in fault diagnosis and other 
fields.

The presence of chironomid larvae in tap water has sparked public concern 
regarding the water supply system in South Korea. Despite ongoing efforts to 
establish a safe water supply system, entirely preventing larval occurrences 
remains a significant challenge. Therefore, we developed a real-time chironomid 
larva detection system (RT-CLAD) based on deep learning technology, which was 
implemented in drinking water treatment plants. The acquisition of larval images 
was facilitated by a multi-spectral camera with a wide spectral range, enabling 
the capture of unique wavelet bands associated with larvae. Three 
state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, namely the convolutional neural 
network (CNN), you only look once (YOLO), and residual neural network (ResNet), 
renowned for their exceptional performance in object detection tasks, were 
employed. Following a comparative analysis of these algorithms, the most 
accurate and rapid model was selected for RT-CLAD. To achieve the efficient and 
accurate detection of larvae, the original images were transformed into a 
specific wavelet format, followed by preprocessing to minimize data size. 
Consequently, the CNN, YOLO, and ResNet algorithms successfully detected larvae 
with 100% accuracy. In comparison to YOLO and ResNet, the CNN algorithm 
demonstrated greater efficiency because of its faster processing and simpler 
architecture. We anticipate that our RT-CLAD will address larva detection 
challenges in water treatment plants, thereby enhancing water supply security.

In today's digitalized era, the usage of Android devices is being extensively 
witnessed in various sectors. Cybercriminals inevitably adapt to new security 
technologies and utilize these platforms to exploit vulnerabilities for 
nefarious purposes, such as stealing users' sensitive and personal data. This 
may result in financial losses, discredit, ransomware, or the spreading of 
infectious malware and other catastrophic cyber-attacks. Due to the fact that 
ransomware encrypts user data and requests a ransom payment in exchange for the 
decryption key, it is one of the most devastating types of malicious software. 
The implications of ransomware attacks can range from a loss of essential data 
to a disruption of business operations and significant monetary damage. 
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, namely machine learning (ML), 
have proven to be notable in the detection of Android ransomware attacks. 
However, ensemble models and deep learning (DL) models have not been 
sufficiently explored. Therefore, in this study, we utilized ML- and DL-based 
techniques to build efficient, precise, and robust models for binary 
classification. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle consisting of 392,035 
records with benign traffic and 10 different types of Android ransomware attacks 
was used to train and test the models. Two experiments were carried out. In 
experiment 1, all the features of the dataset were used. In experiment 2, only 
the best 19 features were used. The deployed models included a decision tree 
(DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble of (DT, 
SVM, and KNN), feedforward neural network (FNN), and tabular attention network 
(TabNet). Overall, the experiments yielded excellent results. DT outperformed 
the others, with an accuracy of 97.24%, precision of 98.50%, and F1-score of 
98.45%. Whereas, in terms of the highest recall, SVM achieved 100%. The acquired 
results were thoroughly discussed, in addition to addressing limitations and 
exploring potential directions for future work.

In recent years, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged, combining edge computing 
with AI, and specifically deep learning, to run AI algorithms directly on edge 
devices. In practical applications, EI faces challenges related to computational 
power, power consumption, size, and cost, with the primary challenge being the 
trade-off between computational power and power consumption. This has rendered 
traditional computing platforms unsustainable, making heterogeneous parallel 
computing platforms a crucial pathway for implementing EI. In our research, we 
leveraged the Xilinx Zynq 7000 heterogeneous computing platform, employed 
high-level synthesis (HLS) for design, and implemented two different 
accelerators for LeNet-5 using loop unrolling and pipelining optimization 
techniques. The experimental results show that when running at a clock speed of 
100 MHz, the PIPELINE accelerator, compared to the UNROLL accelerator, 
experiences an 8.09% increase in power consumption but speeds up by 14.972 
times, making the PIPELINE accelerator superior in performance. Compared to the 
CPU, the PIPELINE accelerator reduces power consumption by 91.37% and speeds up 
by 70.387 times, while compared to the GPU, it reduces power consumption by 
93.35%. This study provides two different optimization schemes for edge 
intelligence applications through design and experimentation and demonstrates 
the impact of different quantization methods on FPGA resource consumption. These 
experimental results can provide a reference for practical applications, thereby 
providing a reference hardware acceleration scheme for edge intelligence 
applications.

Accurate staging of bladder cancer assists in identifying optimal treatment 
(e.g., transurethral resection vs. radical cystectomy vs. bladder preservation). 
However, currently, about one-third of patients are over-staged and one-third 
are under-staged. There is a pressing need for a more accurate staging modality 
to evaluate patients with bladder cancer to assist clinical decision-making. We 
hypothesize that MRI/RNA-seq-based radiogenomics and artificial intelligence can 
more accurately stage bladder cancer. A total of 40 magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were available 
for analysis. Twenty-eight (28) MRI and their matched FFPE tissues were 
available for training analysis, and 12 matched MRI and FFPE tissues were used 
for validation. FFPE samples were subjected to bulk RNA-seq, followed by 
bioinformatics analysis. In the radiomics, several hundred image-based features 
from bladder tumors in MRI were extracted and analyzed. Overall, the model 
obtained mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 94%, 88%, and 92%, 
respectively, in differentiating intra- vs. extra-bladder cancer. The proposed 
model demonstrated improvement in the three matrices by 17%, 33%, and 25% and 
17%, 16%, and 17% as compared to the genetic- and radiomic-based models alone, 
respectively. The radiogenomics of bladder cancer provides insight into 
discriminative features capable of more accurately staging bladder cancer. 
Additional studies are underway.

PURPOSE: This study used a self-deterministic approach to explore the 
relationship between emotional intelligence (EI), academic motivation (AM), and 
achievement among health science students.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in three cities of 
Saudi Arabia (Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah). A convenience sample of 450 students 
was incorporated using the multistage cluster sampling technique. The online 
survey contained three sections: students' basic data and academic achievement 
level, the modified Schutte self-report inventory, and the Academic Motivation 
Scale lowercase.
RESULTS: This study revealed moderate overall scores for EI (57.1%), AM (55.6%), 
and grade point average (GPA) (57.6%). The overall EI score, its domains, and 
GPA had significant positive correlations with overall AM and intrinsic and 
extrinsic motivation (p < .01). Amotivation had an insignificant correlation 
with GPA (p < .05), but it was negatively correlated with EI and its domains (p 
< .01). Multiple regression analysis proved that EI domains predicted 5.0% of 
GPA variance; emotions appraisal and expression (β = .02, p = .024), regulation 
(β = .11, p = .032), and utilization (β = .24, p < .01). EI domains also 
predicted 26.0% of AM variance; emotions appraisal and expression (β = .11, p = 
.04), regulation (β = .33, p < .01), and utilization (β = .23, p <.01). 
Moreover, AM predicted 4.0% of the variance in GPA; intrinsic (β = .25, p = 
.004) and extrinsic (β = .11, p = .022) motivation. AM also predicted 25.0% of 
the variance in EI: intrinsic (β = .34, p < .01) and extrinsic motivation (β = 
.26, p = .026).
CONCLUSION: EI and AM have a bidirectional influence on each other, 
significantly shaping the GPA of health sciences students in Saudi Arabia, where 
intrinsic motivation has a predominant role. Thus, promoting students' AM and EI 
is recommended to foster their academic achievement.

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to report early outcomes of integrating 
Hypotension Prediction Index-guided hemodynamic management within a cardiac 
enhanced recovery pathway on total initial ventilation hours and length of stay 
in the intensive care unit.
METHODS: A multicenter, historical control, observational analysis of 
implementation of a hemodynamic management tool within enhanced recovery 
pathways was conducted by identifying cardiac surgery cases from 3 sites during 
2 time periods, August 1 to December 31, 2019 (preprogram), and April 1 to 
August 31, 2021 (program). Reoperations, emergency (salvage), or cases requiring 
mechanical assist were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic medical 
records and chart reviews. Two primary outcome variables were length of stay in 
the intensive care unit (using Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions) and 
acute kidney injury (using modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 
criteria). One secondary outcome variable, total initial ventilation hours, used 
Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions. Differences in length of stay in the 
intensive care unit and total ventilation time were analyzed using 
Kruskal-Wallis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Acute kidney injury 
stage used chi-square and stepwise cumulative logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 1404 cases (795 preprogram; 609 program) were identified. 
Overall reductions of 6.8 and 4.4 hours in intensive care unit length of stay 
(P = .08) and ventilation time (P = .03) were found, respectively. No 
significant association between proportion of patients identified with acute 
kidney injury by stage and period was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding artificial intelligence-guided hemodynamic management to 
cardiac enhanced recovery pathways resulted in associated reduced time in the 
intensive care unit for patients undergoing nonemergency cardiac surgery across 
institutions in a real-world setting.

INTRODUCTION: The recent global pandemic of Covid-19 caused various disruptions. 
Among them were face-to-face teaching and learning activities being switched to 
virtual sessions in accordance with health authorities recommendations. The 
impact of these changes on work readiness of pharmacy graduates is unknown.
AIM: This study aims to determine the impact of pharmacy graduate's work 
readiness, particularly those that had their studies disrupted from the 
pandemic.
METHODS: Practicing pharmacists with supervisory experience were interviewed on 
their opinions on work readiness of early career and intern pharmacists. 
Specifically, they were asked to comment on work readiness of pharmacy graduates 
who had their later stage of pharmacy education impacted by the pandemic. Data 
was transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. This was also supplemented 
with quantitative data from graduating students in 2020 and 2021 using the Work 
Readiness Scale.
RESULTS: Qualitative feedback showed four themes related to workforce readiness: 
work competence, social intelligence, personal characteristics, and 
organizational acumen. Preceptors interviewed noted differences in communication 
abilities when interacting with patients. However, this improved with time. 
Quantitative data collected from graduates via the validated Work-Readiness 
Scale also showed a more positive agreement towards perceived work readiness. 
These graduates were comfortable with using technology as they had used these 
extensively in their learning during the pandemic and thus was comfortable in 
adopting digital health tools in their practice.
CONCLUSION: Although graduates reported to be work ready, there were gaps in 
communication skills and confidence levels when interacting with patients, as 
reported by supervising preceptors. Graduates also described this sense of 
'missing out' from not having the opportunity to attend face-to-face activities 
like their originally planned hospital placements and how it impacted their 
choice of career. As pharmacists continue to play vital roles as members of the 
broader healthcare workforce, both in clinical and nonclinical settings, 
learnings from this study should be considered in designing educational 
activities to train and develop the workforce of the future.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results obtained with an artificial 
intelligence-based software for predicting the risk of malignancy in breast 
masses from ultrasound images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study evaluating 
555 breast masses submitted to percutaneous biopsy at a cancer referral center. 
Ultrasonographic findings were classified in accordance with the BI-RADS 
lexicon. The images were analyzed by using Koios DS Breast software and 
classified as benign, probably benign, low to intermediate suspicion, high 
suspicion, or probably malignant. The histological classification was considered 
the reference standard.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 51 years, and the mean mass size was 
16 mm. The radiologist evaluation had a sensitivity and specificity of 99.1% and 
34.0%, respectively, compared with 98.2% and 39.0%, respectively, for the 
software evaluation. The positive predictive value for malignancy for the 
BI-RADS categories was similar between the radiologist and software evaluations. 
Two false-negative results were identified in the radiologist evaluation, the 
masses in question being classified as suspicious by the software, whereas four 
false-negative results were identified in the software evaluation, the masses in 
question being classified as suspicious by the radiologist.
CONCLUSION: In our sample, the performance of artificial intelligence-based 
software was comparable to that of a radiologist.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os resultados de um

de malignidade em nódulos mamários.
MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Estudo retrospectivo e unicêntrico que avaliou 555 nódulos 
mamários submetidos a biópsia percutânea em um centro de referência oncológico. 
Os achados ultrassonográficos foram classificados de acordo com o léxico do 
BI-RADS. As imagens foram analisadas pelo software Koios DS Breast e divididas 
em benigna ou provavelmente benigna, suspeita baixa ou intermediária, suspeita 
alta ou provavelmente maligna. O resultado histopatológico foi considerado como 
padrão ouro.
RESULTADOS: A média de idade das pacientes foi de 51 anos e o tamanho médio dos 
nódulos foi de 16 mm. A sensibilidade e a especificidade foram de 99,1% e 34,0% 
para o radiologista e 98,2% e 39,0% para o software, respectivamente. O valor 
preditivo positivo para malignidade para as categorias BIRADS foi semelhante 
para o radiologista e para o software. Foram identificados dois resultados 
falso-negativos na avaliação pelo radiologista que foram classificados como 
suspeitos pelo software, e quatro resultados falso-negativos na avaliação pelo 
software que foram classificados como suspeitos pelo radiologista.
CONCLUSÃO: Na nossa amostra, o software de inteligência artificial demonstrou 
resultados comparáveis à avaliação pelo radiologista.

OBJECTIVE: To validate a deep learning (DL) model for bone age estimation in 
individuals in the city of São Paulo, comparing it with the Greulich and Pyle 
method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of hand and wrist 
radiographs obtained for the determination of bone age. The manual analysis was 
performed by an experienced radiologist. The model used was based on a 
convolutional neural network that placed third in the 2017 Radiological Society 
of North America challenge. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the 
root-mean-square error (RMSE) were calculated for the model versus the 
radiologist, with comparisons by sex, race, and age.
RESULTS: The sample comprised 714 examinations. There was a correlation between 
the two methods, with a coefficient of determination of 0.94. The MAE of the 
predictions was 7.68 months, and the RMSE was 10.27 months. There were no 
statistically significant differences between sexes or among races (p > 0.05). 
The algorithm overestimated bone age in younger individuals (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our DL algorithm demonstrated potential for estimating bone age in 
individuals in the city of São Paulo, regardless of sex and race. However, 
improvements are needed, particularly in relation to its use in younger 
patients.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Validar em indivíduos paulistas um modelo de aprendizado 
profundo (deep learning - DL) para estimativa da idade óssea, comparando-o com o 
método de Greulich e Pyle.
MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal com radiografias de mão e punho para 
idade óssea. A análise manual foi feita por um radiologista experiente. Foi 
usado um modelo baseado em uma rede neural convolucional que ficou em terceiro 
lugar no desafio de 2017 da Radiological Society of North America. Calcularam-se 
o erro médio absoluto (mean absolute error - MAE) e a raiz do erro médio 
quadrado (root mean-square error - RMSE) do modelo contra o radiologista, com 
comparações entre sexo, etnia e idade.
RESULTADOS: A amostra compreendia 714 exames. Houve correlação entre ambos os 
métodos com coeficiente de determinação de 0,94. O MAE das predições foi 7,68 
meses e a RMSE foi 10,27 meses. Não houve diferenças estatisticamente 
significantes entre sexos ou raças (p > 0,05). O algoritmo superestimou a idade 
óssea nos mais jovens (p = 0,001).
CONCLUSÃO: O nosso algoritmo de DL demonstrou potencial para estimar a idade 
óssea em indivíduos paulistas, independentemente do sexo e da raça. Entretanto, 
há necessidade de aprimoramentos, particularmente em pacientes mais jovens.

Smart grading: A generative AI-based tool for knowledge-grounded answer 
evaluation in educational assessments.

Tobler S(1).

Author information:
(1)ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

Evaluating text-based answers obtained in educational settings or behavioral 
studies is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Applying novel artificial 
intelligence tools such as ChatGPT might support the process. Still, currently 
available implementations do not allow for automated and case-specific 
evaluations of large numbers of student answers. To counter this limitation, we 
developed a flexible software and user-friendly web application that enables 
researchers and educators to use cutting-edge artificial intelligence 
technologies by providing an interface that combines large language models with 
options to specify questions of interest, sample solutions, and evaluation 
instructions for automated answer scoring. We validated the method in an 
empirical study and found the software with expert ratings to have high 
reliability. Hence, the present software constitutes a valuable tool to 
facilitate and enhance text-based answer evaluation.•Generative AI-enhanced 
software for customizable, case-specific, and automized grading of large amounts 
of text-based answers.•Open-source software and web application for direct 
implementation and adaptation.

Launched in 2016, the PMUY Programme of the Government of India aimed to provide 
8 crore LPG connections to women in rural households over four years. After 
acquiring a new connection, some households appeared uninterested in ordering 
subsequent subsidized LPG refills, impacting programme's sustainability, and 
targeting strategy. We propose a prediction model using "Explainable Machine 
Learning" to anticipate the beneficiaries' refill frequency with a view to 
improving LPG-refills and social targeting. In this paper, we suggest an 
enhanced stacked SVM (ISS) model for classification, which is contrasted with 
state-of-art ML models: Random Forest (RF), SVM-RBF, Naive Bayes (NB), and 
Decision Tree (C5.0). Some of the performance matrices that are used to evaluate 
the models include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's Kappa statistics, 
Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC). 
The proposed approach, which was validated with 10-fold cross validation, 
produced the best overall accuracies for data splits of 50-50, 66-34, and 80-20. 
The "Explainable AI (XAI)" model has also been used to describe how models and 
features interact, and to discuss the importance of features and their 
contributions to prediction. The recommended XAI will aid in efficient 
"beneficiary targeting" and "policy interventions".

Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Infertility is a psychological crisis for a couple, spouse, and 
their families. Due to the positive effects of spiritual intelligence on the 
positive adaptation and growth of the individual under difficult circumstances, 
this study was conducted to determine the relationship between spiritual 
intelligence and resilience in infertile couples in Isfahan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2020 on 162 
infertile couples. Data were collected by the convenience sampling method from 
infertile couples referring to Infertility Centers in Isfahan through two 
standard questionnaires. Data analysis was performed using descriptive 
statistical methods for quantitative variables. The relationship between 
spiritual intelligence and resilience score was investigated using inferential 
statistical methods of Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple linear 
regression. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: The results showed that the mean age Standard Deviation (SD) of women 
and their spouses was 32.01 (5.86) and 36.30 (5.82) years, respectively. 
Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that there was a significant positive 
direct relationship between resilience score with total spiritual intelligence 
score (r = 0.36, p < 0.001) and its dimensions Critical Existential Thinking 
(CET) (r = 0.60, p < 0.001), personal meaning production (PMP) (r = 0.38, p < 
0.001), Transcendental Awareness (TA) (r = 0.43, p < 0.001), and Conscious State 
Expansion (CSE) (r = 0.53, p < 0.001). The PMP (t = 6.38, p < 0.001) and the CSE 
(t = 2.15, p = 0.03) were significant predictors of resilience scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The result of our study showed that couples with a higher level of 
spiritual intelligence had a better understanding of the problems and harms of 
primary infertility and would cope with it more efficiently.

BACKGROUND: Some nurses leave their job because of working conditions, which 
will affect nurse turnover. Patients perceive that those nurses are distrustful, 
and feel unsatisfied, with patients' complaints about nursing service. This 
study explored factors about the professional self-concept of nursing students 
and nurses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of cross-sectional studies followed 
PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing 
and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were used from 1982 to August 2020 with 
the terms "factors" AND "nurse" AND "professional" AND "self-concept." A total 
of 19 out of 4,349 articles were used for analysis. Joanna Brings Institute 
critical appraisal tools for the analytical cross-sectional studies were used in 
this study, and narrative synthesis was used to analyze data.
RESULTS: Professional self-concept of clinical nurses is influenced by including 
organizational or job factors, and individual and emotional factors. Job factors 
consist of organizational support, professional ethic, clinical ladder system, 
nursing experience, position, and time. Besides, sex, age, marital status, 
education, health status, healthy lifestyle, and experience were categorized as 
individual factors. Emotional factors were as follows: interpersonal 
relationships, spiritual growth, management stress, and self-description. 
Meanwhile, student nurses are influenced by including personal (degree of study 
and sex), emotions (emotional intelligence, and interest in the nursing 
profession), and external factors (nursing courses, peer-mentoring experience, 
and academic burnout).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, individual factors and emotions have a vital role in 
constructing clinical nurses' professional self-concept as student nurses. 
Improving individual and emotional/personal aspects will positively increase 
professional self-concept.

Manuka honey (MH) is a highly prized natural product from the nectar of 
Leptospermum scoparium flowers. Increased competition on the global market 
drives MH product innovations. This review updates comparative and 
non-comparative studies to highlight nutritional, therapeutic, bioengineering, 
and cosmetic values of MH. MH is a good source of phenolics and unique chemical 
compounds, such as methylglyoxal, dihydroxyacetone, leptosperin glyoxal, 
methylsyringate and leptosin. Based on the evidence from in vitro, in vivo and 
clinical studies, multifunctional bioactive compounds of MH have exhibited 
anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-microbial, and 
anti-cancer activities. There are controversial topics related to MH, such as MH 
grading, safety/efficacy, implied benefits, and maximum levels of contaminants 
concerned. Artificial intelligence can optimize MH studies related to chemical 
analysis, toxicity prediction, multi-functional mechanism exploration and 
product innovation.

Enzymes are closely associated with the onset and progression of numerous 
diseases, making enzymes a primary target in innovative drug development. 
However, the challenge remains in identifying compounds that exhibit potent 
inhibitory effects on the target enzymes. With the continuous expansion of the 
total number of natural products and increasing difficulty in isolating and 
enriching new compounds, traditional high-throughput screening methods are 
finding it increasingly challenging to meet the demands of new drug development. 
Virtual screening, characterized by its high efficiency and low cost, has 
gradually become an indispensable technology in drug development. It represents 
a prominent example of the integration of artificial intelligence with 
biopharmaceuticals and is an inevitable trend in the rapid development of 
innovative drug screening in the future. Therefore, this article primarily 
focused on systematically reviewing the recent applications of virtual screening 
technology in the development of enzyme inhibitors and explored the prospects 
and advantages of using this technology in developing new drugs, aiming to 
provide essential theoretical insights and references for the application of 
related technologies in the field of new drug development.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) may have a negative impact on mortality in patients with 
heart failure (HF) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Early prediction of CS 
can result in improved survival. Artificial intelligence (AI) through machine 
learning (ML) models have shown promise in predictive medicine. Here, we conduct 
a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of these 
models in the early prediction of CS. A thorough search of the PubMed, Web of 
Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was conducted from the time of inception 
until November 2, 2023, to find relevant studies. Our outcomes were area under 
the curve (AUC), the sensitivity and specificity of the ML model, the accuracy 
of the ML model, and the predictor variables that had the most impact in 
predicting CS. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3.0 was used to conduct 
the meta-analysis. Six studies were considered in our study. The pooled mean AUC 
was 0.808 (95% confidence interval: 0.727, 0.890). The AUC in the included 
studies ranged from 0.77 to 0.91. ML models performed well, with accuracy 
ranging from 0.88 to 0.93 and sensitivity and specificity of 58%-78% and 
88%-93%, respectively. Age, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and 
blood glucose were the most significant variables required by ML models to 
acquire their outputs. In conclusion, AI has the potential for early prediction 
of CS, which may lead to a decrease in the high mortality rate associated with 
it. Future studies are needed to confirm the results.

Soft electromechanical sensors have led to a new paradigm of electronic devices 
for novel motion-based wearable applications in our daily lives. However, the 
vast amount of random and unidentified signals generated by complex body motions 
has hindered the precise recognition and practical application of this 
technology. Recent advancements in artificial-intelligence technology have 
enabled significant strides in extracting features from massive and intricate 
data sets, thereby presenting a breakthrough in utilizing wearable sensors for 
practical applications. Beyond traditional machine-learning techniques for 
classifying simple gestures, advanced machine-learning algorithms have been 
developed to handle more complex and nuanced motion-based tasks with restricted 
training data sets. Machine-learning techniques have improved the ability to 
perceive, and thus machine-learned wearable soft sensors have enabled accurate 
and rapid human-gesture recognition, providing real-time feedback to users. This 
forms a crucial component of future wearable electronics, contributing to a 
robust human-machine interface. In this review, we provide a comprehensive 
summary covering materials, structures and machine-learning algorithms for 
hand-gesture recognition and possible practical applications through 
machine-learned wearable electromechanical sensors.

Irrespective of men and women, colorectal cancer (CRC), is the third most common 
cancer in the population with more than 1.85 million cases annually. Fewer than 
20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly 
preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several 
screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging 
examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult 
blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available 
with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening 
methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or 
sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, 
and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and 
diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, 
cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and 
deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to 
treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial 
neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines 
(SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment 
options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for 
therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI.

Graptolites, fossils significant for evolutionary studies and shale gas 
exploration, are traditionally identified visually by taxonomists due to their 
intricate morphologies and preservation challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
holds great promise for transforming such meticulous tasks. In this paper, we 
demonstrate that graptolites can be identified with taxonomist accuracy using a 
deep learning model. We construct the most sophisticated and largest 
professional single organisms image dataset to date, which is composed of 
>34,000 images of 113 graptolite species annotated at pixel-level resolution to 
train the model, develop, and evaluate deep learning networks to classify 
graptolites. The model's performance surpassed taxonomists in accuracy, time, 
and generalization, achieving 86% and 81% accuracy in identifying graptolite 
genus and species, respectively. This AI-based method, capable of recognizing 
minute morphological details better than taxonomists, can be integrated into web 
and mobile apps, extending graptolite identification beyond research institutes 
and enhancing shale gas exploration efficiency.

A cross-ribosome binding site (cRBS) adjusts the dynamic range of transcription 
factor-based biosensors (TFBs) by controlling protein expression and folding. 
The rational design of a cRBS with desired TFB dynamic range remains an 
important issue in TFB forward and reverse engineering. Here, we report a novel 
artificial intelligence (AI)-based forward-reverse engineering platform for TFB 
dynamic range prediction and de novo cRBS design with selected TFB dynamic 
ranges. The platform demonstrated superior in processing unbalanced 
minority-class datasets and was guided by sequence characteristics from trained 
cRBSs. The platform identified correlations between cRBSs and dynamic ranges to 
mimic bidirectional design between these factors based on Wasserstein generative 
adversarial network (GAN) with a gradient penalty (GP) (WGAN-GP) and balancing 
GAN with GP (BAGAN-GP). For forward and reverse engineering, the predictive 
accuracy was up to 98% and 82%, respectively. Collectively, we generated an 
AI-based method for the rational design of TFBs with desired dynamic ranges.

patients.

The primary aim of this research was to investigate potential differences of 
breast tumor morphologies across African American and Caucasian racial groups by 
utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. While 
breast cancer disparities can partially be attributed to social determinants of 
health, tumor biology also contributes to survival outcomes. The rate of breast 
tumor growth is largely dependent on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Current 
research suggests the cellular components of the ECM may vary among racial and 
ethnic populations, and this may contribute to the incidence of cancer in 
African Americans. We utilized a supervised AI method to evaluate morphological 
differences between African American and Caucasian breast cancer tumors. Images 
used for analysis were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
biorepository stored in the NIH Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal. We 
designed an ML classifier using the AlexNet model provided in PyTorch's 
torchvision package. The model was pre-trained and adapted via transfer learning 
resulting in a classification accuracy of 92.1% when using our breast cancer 
tumor image database split into 80% of training set and 20% of testing set. We 
interpreted the results of the AlexNet and ResNet50 models using LIME and 
saliency mapping as the explainers. Based on the images from our bi-racial 
testing set, this study confirmed significant variations of tumor and ECM 
regions in the different racial groups evaluated. Based on these findings, 
further analysis and characterization may provide new insight into disparities 
associated with the incidence of breast cancer.

Therapeutic protein, represented by antibodies, is of increasing interest in 
human medicine. However, clinical translation of therapeutic protein is still 
largely hindered by different aspects of developability, including affinity and 
selectivity, stability and aggregation prevention, solubility and viscosity 
reduction, and deimmunization. Conventional optimization of the developability 
with widely used methods, like display technologies and library screening 
approaches, is a time and cost-intensive endeavor, and the efficiency in finding 
suitable solutions is still not enough to meet clinical needs. In recent years, 
the accelerated advancement of computational methodologies has ushered in a 
transformative era in the field of therapeutic protein design. Owing to their 
remarkable capabilities in feature extraction and modeling, the integration of 
cutting-edge computational strategies with conventional techniques presents a 
promising avenue to accelerate the progression of therapeutic protein design and 
optimization toward clinical implementation. Here, we compared the differences 
between therapeutic protein and small molecules in developability and provided 
an overview of the computational approaches applicable to the design or 
optimization of therapeutic protein in several developability issues.

GANcMRI: Cardiac magnetic resonance video generation and physiologic guidance 
using latent space prompting.

Generative artificial intelligence can be applied to medical imaging on tasks 
such as privacy-preserving image generation and superresolution and denoising of 
existing images. Few prior approaches have used cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging (cMRI) as a modality given the complexity of videos (the addition of the 
temporal dimension) as well as the limited scale of publicly available datasets. 
We introduce GANcMRI, a generative adversarial network that can synthesize cMRI 
videos with physiological guidance based on latent space prompting. GANcMRI uses 
a StyleGAN framework to learn the latent space from individual video frames and 
leverages the timedependent trajectory between end-systolic and end-diastolic 
frames in the latent space to predict progression and generate motion over time. 
We proposed various methods for modeling latent time-dependent trajectories and 
found that our Frame-to-frame approach generates the best motion and video 
quality. GANcMRI generated high-quality cMRI image frames that are 
indistinguishable by cardiologists, however, artifacts in video generation allow 
cardiologists to still recognize the difference between real and generated 
videos. The generated cMRI videos can be prompted to apply physiologybased 
adjustments which produces clinically relevant phenotypes recognizable by 
cardiologists. GANcMRI has many potential applications such as data 
augmentation, education, anomaly detection, and preoperative planning.

In the 21st century, the development of medical science has entered the era of 
big data, and machine learning has become an essential tool for mining medical 
big data. The establishment of the SEER database has provided a wealth of 
epidemiological data for cancer clinical research, and the number of studies 
based on SEER and machine learning has been growing in recent years. This 
article reviews recent research based on SEER and machine learning and finds 
that the current focus of such studies is primarily on the development and 
validation of models using machine learning algorithms, with the main directions 
being lymph node metastasis prediction, distant metastasis prediction, and 
prognosis-related research. Compared to traditional models, machine learning 
algorithms have the advantage of stronger adaptability, but also suffer from 
disadvantages such as overfitting and poor interpretability, which need to be 
weighed in practical applications. At present, machine learning algorithms, as 
the foundation of artificial intelligence, have just begun to emerge in the 
field of cancer clinical research. The future development of oncology will enter 
a more precise era of cancer research, characterized by larger data, higher 
dimensions, and more frequent information exchange. Machine learning is bound to 
shine brightly in this field.

The success of deep neural networks suggests that cognition may emerge from 
indecipherable patterns of distributed neural activity. Yet these networks are 
pattern-matching black boxes that cannot simulate higher cognitive functions and 
lack numerous neurobiological features. Accordingly, they are currently 
insufficient computational models for understanding neural information 
processing. Here, we show how neural circuits can directly encode cognitive 
processes via simple neurobiological principles. To illustrate, we implemented 
this model in a non-gradient-based machine learning algorithm to train deep 
neural networks called essence neural networks (ENNs). Neural information 
processing in ENNs is intrinsically explainable, even on benchmark computer 
vision tasks. ENNs can also simulate higher cognitive functions such as 
deliberation, symbolic reasoning and out-of-distribution generalization. ENNs 
display network properties associated with the brain, such as modularity, 
distributed and localist firing, and adversarial robustness. ENNs establish a 
broad computational framework to decipher the neural basis of cognition and 
pursue artificial general intelligence.

Over the past decade, artificial intelligence has been propelled forward by 
advances in machine learning algorithms and computational hardware, opening up 
myriads of new avenues for scientific research. Nevertheless, virtual assistants 
and voice control have yet to be widely used in the natural sciences. Here, we 
present ChemVox, an interactive Amazon Alexa skill that uses speech recognition 
to perform quantum chemistry calculations. This new application interfaces Alexa 
with cloud computing and returns the results through a capable device. ChemVox 
paves the way to making computational chemistry routinely accessible to the 
wider community.

The discovery of new structural and functional materials is driven by phase 
identification, often using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Automation has accelerated 
the rate of XRD measurements, greatly outpacing XRD analysis techniques that 
remain manual, time-consuming, error-prone and impossible to scale. With the 
advent of autonomous robotic scientists or self-driving laboratories, 
contemporary techniques prohibit the integration of XRD. Here, we describe a 
computer program for the autonomous characterization of XRD data, driven by 
artificial intelligence (AI), for the discovery of new materials. Starting from 
structural databases, we train an ensemble model using a physically accurate 
synthetic dataset, which outputs probabilistic classifications-rather than 
absolutes-to overcome the overconfidence in traditional neural networks. This AI 
agent behaves as a companion to the researcher, improving accuracy and offering 
substantial time savings. It is demonstrated on a diverse set of organic and 
inorganic materials characterization challenges. This method is directly 
applicable to inverse design approaches and robotic discovery systems, and can 
be immediately considered for other forms of characterization such as 
spectroscopy and the pair distribution function.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) are the physiological signals and a standard test to 
measure the heart's electrical activity that depicts the movement of cardiac 
muscles. A review study has been conducted on ECG signals analysis with the help 
of artificial intelligence (AI) methods over the last ten years i.e., 2012-22. 
Primarily, the method of ECG analysis by software systems was divided into 
classical signal processing (e.g. spectrograms or filters), machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL), including recursive models, transformers and 
hybrid. Secondly, the data sources and benchmark datasets were depicted. Authors 
grouped resources by ECG acquisition methods into hospital-based portable 
machines and wearable devices. Authors also included new trends like advanced 
pre-processing, data augmentation, simulations and agent-based modeling. The 
study found improvement in ECG examination perfection made each year through ML, 
DL, hybrid models, and transformers. Convolutional neural networks and hybrid 
models were more targeted and proved efficient. The transformer model extended 
the accuracy from 90% to 98%. The Physio-Net library helps acquire ECG signals, 
including the popular benchmark databases such as MIT-BIH, PTB, and challenging 
datasets. Similarly, wearable devices have been established as a appropriate 
option for monitoring patient health without the time and place limitations and 
are also helpful for AI model calibration with so far accuracy of 82%-83% on 
Samsung smartwatch. In the pre-processing signals, spectrogram generation 
through Fourier and wavelet transformations are erected leading approaches 
promoting on average accuracy of 90%-95%. Likewise, data enhancement using 
geometrical techniques is well-considered; however, extraction and 
concatenation-based methods need attention. As the what-if analysis in 
healthcare or cardiac issues can be performed using a complex simulation, the 
study reviews agent-based modeling and simulation approaches for cardiovascular 
risk event assessment.

Subscapularis pathology is difficult to diagnose, in part because of decreased 
sensitivity and accuracy in identifying tears with magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) when compared to other cuff tendons. Artificial intelligence evaluation of 
patient physical examination and MRI data using a machine learning model shows 
that arthroscopically confirmed partial- or full-thickness subscapularis tears 
are highly associated with abnormal subscapularis tendon length, long head of 
the biceps tears, and subscapularis fatty atrophy, and on physical examination, 
with weakness with internal rotation and positive lift-off, belly press, and 
bear hug tests. Today, physicians may use machine learning as a tool, but this 
model may not currently be sufficient to drastically change practice. However, 
with continued research and development, which is occurring rapidly, similar 
models could aid physicians in timely identification of pathology and 
optimization of preoperative planning, as well as physician training and 
education.

Editorial Commentary: Subtle degenerative tears that so commonly involve the 
upper third of the subscapularis are oftentimes missed.

Subtle degenerative tears that so commonly involve the upper third of the 
subscapularis are oftentimes missed. However, there are physical examination, 
imaging, and arthroscopic findings that are highly suggestive of subscapularis 
tearing. Positive belly-press and bear hug tests, a thinner and longer 
subscapularis tendon, subscapularis muscle, belly loss of bulk or fatty 
infiltration, narrow coracohumeral distance, and biceps pathology are 
indicative. Artificial intelligence-based predictive algorithms can estimate the 
likelihood of subscapularis tearing based on a combined analysis of these and 
other features. Improved outcomes should logically be expected for those 
shoulders with subscapularis tears that are identified and repaired. Finally, 
some research suggests that debridement remains an alternative to repair; 
however, pending future research, debridement is not the author's preferred 
treatment.

Editorial Commentary: Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Biomedical, Large, 
Clinical Registry Data Using Machine Learning Requires Tens of Thousands of 
Subjects and a Focus on Substantial Clinical Benefit: MCID Is too Low a Bar.

Harris JD.

As the field of arthroscopic hip preservation surgery grows, large high-quality 
registries represent a foundational study design for establishing whether hip 
arthroscopy is effective for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome 
(FAIS). Original research publications from experienced high-volume surgeons 
tell us "Can it work". A registry tells us "Does it work?". The ability of 
preservation to truly preserve the joint, delay the arthritis process, and 
reduce the risk of arthroplasty requires long-term follow-up. A geographic 
registry can follow this. The registry represents the "real world", a 
heterogeneous set of variables pertaining to the doctor, patient, intervention, 
and outcome. The vast array of factors that can be analyzed before, during, and 
after surgery makes machine learning an ideal technique for analysis of large 
quantities of data. A global hip preservation surgery registry is a desirable 
and achievable goal. In order to optimally predict outcome of hip arthroscopy, 
given the known large number of patient- and hip-specific factors that influence 
outcomes, a deep learning model with tens of thousands of subjects for this 
medium-scale task would be needed. Measures of clinical relevance need to 
include more than just MCID (minimal clinically important difference), which is 
the lowest bar minimal threshold. Patient expectations often far exceed 
MCID-requiring other metrics like SCB (substantial clinical benefit), PASS 
(patient acceptable symptom state), and MOI (maximal outcome improvement). 
Registries should include validated, reliable, and responsive patient-reported 
outcome scores (e.g., International Hip Outcome Tool [iHOT-12]) with measures of 
clinical relevance and expectations assessed routinely. The United Kingdom's 
NAHR (Non-Arthroplasty Hip Registry) and Denmark's DHAR (Danish Hip Arthroscopy 
Registry) are the two largest geography-based registries in current hip 
preservation research both with 11 years of patient enrollment.

The nanotechnology-driven industrial revolution widely relies on metal 
oxide-based nanomaterial (NM). Zinc oxide (ZnO) production has rapidly increased 
globally due to its outstanding physical and chemical properties and versatile 
applications in industries including cement, rubber, paints, cosmetics, and 
more. Nevertheless, releasing Zn2+ ions into the environment can profoundly 
impact living systems and affect water-based ecosystems, including biological 
ones. In aquatic environments, Zn2+ ions can change water properties, directly 
influencing underwater ecosystems, especially fish populations. These ions can 
accumulate in fish tissues when fish are exposed to contaminated water and pose 
health risks to humans who consume them, leading to symptoms such as nausea, 
vomiting, and even organ damage. To address this issue, safety of ZnO NMs should 
be enhanced without altering their nanoscale properties, thus preventing 
toxic-related problems. In this study, an eco-friendly precipitation method was 
employed to prepare ZnO NMs. These NMs were found to reduce ZnO toxicity levels 
by incorporating elements such as Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. Structural, morphological, 
and optical properties of synthesized NMs were thoroughly investigated. In vitro 
tests demonstrated potential antioxidative properties of NMs with significant 
effects on free radical scavenging activities. In vivo, toxicity tests were 
conducted using Oreochromis mossambicus fish and male Swiss Albino mice to 
compare toxicities of different ZnO NMs. Fish and mice exposed to these NMs 
exhibited biochemical changes and histological abnormalities. Notably, ZnCaO NMs 
demonstrated lower toxicity to fish and mice than other ZnO NMs. This was 
attributed to its Ca2+ ions, which could enhance body growth metabolism compared 
to other metals, thus improving material safety. Furthermore, whether 
nanomaterials' surface roughness might contribute to their increased toxicity in 
biological systems was investigated utilizing computer vision (CV)-based AI 
tools to obtain SEM images of NMs, providing valuable image-based surface 
morphology data that could be correlated with relevant toxicology studies.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a progressive condition with high global 
incidence. HF has two main subtypes: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) 
and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). There is an inherent need for 
simple yet effective electrocardiogram (ECG)-based artificial intelligence (AI; 
ECG-AI) models that can predict HF risk early to allow for risk modification.
OBJECTIVE: The main objectives were to validate HF risk prediction models using 
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) data and assess performance on 
HFpEF and HFrEF classification.
METHODS: There were six models in comparision derived using ARIC data. 1) The 
ECG-AI model predicting HF risk was developed using raw 12-lead ECGs with a 
convolutional neural network. The clinical models from 2) ARIC (ARIC-HF) and 3) 
Framingham Heart Study (FHS-HF) used 9 and 8 variables, respectively. 4) Cox 
proportional hazards (CPH) model developed using the clinical risk factors in 
ARIC-HF or FHS-HF. 5) CPH model using the outcome of ECG-AI and the clinical 
risk factors used in CPH model (ECG-AI-Cox) and 6) A Light Gradient Boosting 
Machine model using 288 ECG Characteristics (ECG-Chars). All the models were 
validated on MESA. The performances of these models were evaluated using the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using 
the DeLong test.
RESULTS: ECG-AI, ECG-Chars, and ECG-AI-Cox resulted in validation AUCs of 0.77, 
0.73, and 0.84, respectively. ARIC-HF and FHS-HF yielded AUCs of 0.76 and 0.74, 
respectively, and CPH resulted in AUC = 0.78. ECG-AI-Cox outperformed all other 
models. ECG-AI-Cox provided an AUC of 0.85 for HFrEF and 0.83 for HFpEF.
CONCLUSION: ECG-AI using ECGs provides better-validated predictions when 
compared to HF risk calculators, and the ECG feature model and also works well 
with HFpEF and HFrEF classification.

from wearables.

BACKGROUND: Smartwatches enable continuous and noninvasive time series 
monitoring of cardiovascular biomarkers like heart rate (from 
photoplethysmograms), step counter, skin temperature, et cetera; as such, they 
have promise in assisting in early detection and prevention of cardiovascular 
disease. Although these biomarkers may not be directly useful to physicians, a 
machine learning (ML) model could find clinically relevant patterns. 
Unfortunately, ML models typically need supervised (ie, annotated) data, and 
labeling of large amounts of continuous data is very labor intensive. Therefore, 
ML methods that are data efficient, ie, needing a low number of labels, are 
required to detect potential clinical value in patterns found in wearable data.
OBJECTIVE: The primary study objective of the ME-TIME (Machine Learning Enabled 
Time Series Analysis in Medicine) study is to design an ML model that can detect 
atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) from wearable data in a 
data-efficient manner. To achieve this, self-supervised and weakly supervised 
learning techniques are used.
METHODS: Two hundred subjects (100 reference, 50 AF, and 50 HF) are being 
invited to participate in wearing a Fitbit fitness tracker for 3 months. 
Interested volunteers are sent a questionnaire to determine their health, in 
particular cardiovascular health. Volunteers without any (history of) serious 
illness are assigned to the reference group. Participants with AF and HF are 
recruited in the Haga teaching hospital in The Hague, The Netherlands.
RESULTS: Enrollment commenced on May 1, 2022, and as of the time of this report, 
62 subjects have been included in the study. Preliminary analysis of the data 
reveals significant inter-subject variability. Notably, we identified heart rate 
recovery curves and time-delayed correlations between heart rate and step count 
as potential strong indicators for heart disease.
CONCLUSION: Using self-supervised and multiple-instance learning techniques, we 
hypothesize that patterns specific to AF and HF can be found in continuous data 
obtained from smartwatches.

Massively parallel reporter assay measures transcriptional activities of various 
cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a single experiment. We developed a 
thermodynamic computational model framework that calculates quantitative levels 
of gene expression directly from regulatory DNA sequences. Using the framework, 
we investigated the molecular mechanisms of cis-regulatory mutations of a 
synthetic enhancer that cause abnormal gene expression. We found that, in a 
human cell line, competitive binding between family transcription factors (TFs) 
with slightly different binding preferences significantly increases the accuracy 
of recapitulating the transcriptional effects of thousands of single- or 
multi-mutations. We also discovered that even if various harmful mutations 
occurred in an activator binding site, CRM could stably maintain or even 
increase gene expression through a certain form of competitive binding between 
family TFs. These findings enhance understanding the effect of SNPs and indels 
on CRMs and would help building robust custom-designed CRMs for biologics 
production and gene therapy.

The functional movement screen (FMS) test is a seven-test battery used to assess 
fundamental movement abilities of individuals. It is commonly used to predict 
sports injuries but relies on clinical expertise and is not suitable for 
self-examination. This study presents an automatic FMS movement assessment 
framework using a multi-view deep neural network called MVDNN. The framework 
combines automatic skeleton extraction with manual feature selection to extract 
3D trajectory features of human skeleton joints from two different directions. 
Three mainstream methods of time-series modeling are then used to learn 
high-level feature representation from skeleton sequences, and motion features 
from two views are fused to provide complementary information. Results of public 
FMS movements dataset demonstrate that our MVDNN outperforms current 
state-of-the-art methods with an average miF1 score of 0.857, maF1 score of 
0.768, and Kappa score of 0.640 over ten runs.

Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, poses a significant global 
health concern due to the excessive accumulation of fat within the liver. If 
left untreated, this condition can give rise to severe complications. Recent 
advances in artificial intelligence (AI, specifically AI-based ultrasound 
imaging) offer promising tools for diagnosing this condition. This review 
endeavors to explore the current state of research concerning AI's role in 
diagnosing fatty liver disease, with a particular emphasis on imaging methods. 
To this end, a comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases, 
including Google Scholar and Embase, to identify relevant studies published 
between January 2010 and May 2023, with keywords such as "fatty liver disease" 
and "artificial intelligence (AI)." The article selection process adhered to the 
PRISMA framework, ultimately resulting in the inclusion of 13 studies. These 
studies leveraged AI-assisted ultrasound due to its accessibility and 
cost-effectiveness, and they hailed from diverse countries, including India, 
China, Singapore, the United States, Egypt, Iran, Poland, Malaysia, and Korea. 
These studies employed a variety of AI classifiers, such as support vector 
machines, convolutional neural networks, multilayer perceptron, fuzzy Sugeno, 
and probabilistic neural networks, all of which demonstrated a remarkable level 
of precision. Notably, one study even achieved a diagnostic accuracy rate of 
100%, underscoring AI's potential in diagnosing fatty liver disease. 
Nevertheless, the review acknowledged certain limitations within the included 
studies, with the majority featuring relatively small sample sizes, often 
encompassing fewer than 100 patients. Additionally, the variability in AI 
algorithms and imaging techniques added complexity to the comparative analysis. 
In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of AI in enhancing the 
diagnosis and management of fatty liver disease through advanced imaging 
techniques. Future research endeavors should prioritize the execution of 
large-scale studies that employ standardized AI algorithms and imaging 
techniques to validate AI's utility in diagnosing this prevalent health 
condition.

The pharmaceutical manufacturing sector needs to rapidly evolve to absorb the 
next wave of disruptive industrial innovations - Industry 4.0. This involves 
incorporating technologies like artificial intelligence, smart factories and 3D 
printing to automate, miniaturize and personalize the production processes. The 
goal of this study is to build a formulation and process design (FPD) framework 
for a pharmaceutical 3D printing technique called drop-on-demand (DoD) printing. 
FPD can automate the determination of formulation properties and printing 
conditions (input conditions) for DoD operation that can guarantee production of 
drug products with desired functional attributes. This study proposes to build 
the FPD framework in two parts: the first part involves building a machine 
learning model to simulate the forward problem - predicting DoD operation based 
on input conditions and the second part seeks to solve and experimentally 
validate the inverse problem - predicting input conditions that can yield 
desired DoD operation.

Despite the high prevalence and burden of mental health conditions, there is a 
global shortage of mental health providers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods 
have been proposed as a way to address this shortage, by supporting providers 
with less extensive training as they deliver care. To this end, we developed the 
AI-Assisted Provider Platform (A2P2), a text-based virtual therapy interface 
that includes a response suggestion feature, which supports providers in 
delivering protocolized therapies empathetically. We studied providers with and 
without expertise in mental health treatment delivering a therapy session using 
the platform with (intervention) and without (control) AI-assistance features. 
Upon evaluation, the AI-assisted system significantly decreased response times 
by 29.34% (p=0.002), tripled empathic response accuracy (p=0.0001), and 
increased goal recommendation accuracy by 66.67% (p=0.001) across both user 
groups compared to the control. Both groups rated the system as having excellent 
usability.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autocontouring for radiotherapy has the potential to 
significantly save time and reduce interobserver variability. We aimed to assess 
the performance of a commercial autocontouring model for head and neck (H&N) 
patients in eight orientations relevant to particle therapy with fixed beam 
lines, focusing on validation and implementation for routine clinical use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Autocontouring was performed on sixteen organs at risk 
(OARs) for 98 adult and pediatric patients with 137 H&N CT scans in eight 
orientations. A geometric comparison of the autocontours and manual 
segmentations was performed using the Hausdorff Distance 95th percentile, Dice 
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and surface DSC and compared to interobserver 
variability where available. Additional qualitative scoring and 
dose-volume-histogram (DVH) parameters analyses were performed for twenty 
patients in two positions, consisting of scoring on a 0-3 scale based on 
clinical usability and comparing the mean (Dmean) and near-maximum (D2%) dose, 
respectively.
RESULTS: For the geometric analysis, the model performance in head-first-supine 
straight and hyperextended orientations was in the same range as the 
interobserver variability. HD95, DSC and surface DSC was heterogeneous in other 
orientations. No significant geometric differences were found between pediatric 
and adult autocontours. The qualitative scoring yielded a median score of ≥ 2 
for 13/16 OARs while 7/32 DVH parameters were significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: For head-first-supine straight and hyperextended scans, we found 
that 13/16 OAR autocontours were suited for use in daily clinical practice and 
subsequently implemented. Further development is needed for other patient 
orientations before implementation.

BACKGROUND: In 2020, our center established a Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3) 
artificial intelligence (AI) system using a convolutional neural network (CNN), 
which was built upon 9059 radiographs. However, the system, upon which our study 
is based, lacked a gold standard for comparison and had not undergone thorough 
evaluation in different working environments.
METHODS: To further verify the applicability of the AI system in clinical bone 
age assessment (BAA) and to enhance the accuracy and homogeneity of BAA, a 
prospective multi-center validation was conducted. This study utilized 744 
left-hand radiographs of patients, ranging from 1 to 20 years of age, with 378 
boys and 366 girls. These radiographs were obtained from nine different 
children's hospitals between August and December 2020. The BAAs were performed 
using the TW3 AI system and were also reviewed by experienced reviewers. Bone 
age accuracy within 1 year, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute 
error (MAE) were statistically calculated to evaluate the accuracy. Kappa test 
and Bland-Altman (B-A) plot were conducted to measure the diagnostic 
consistency.
RESULTS: The system exhibited a high level of performance, producing results 
that closely aligned with those of the reviewers. It achieved a RMSE of 0.52 
years and an accuracy of 94.55% for the radius, ulna, and short bones series. 
When assessing the carpal series of bones, the system achieved a RMSE of 0.85 
years and an accuracy of 80.38%. Overall, the system displayed satisfactory 
accuracy and RMSE, particularly in patients over 7 years old. The system 
excelled in evaluating the carpal bone age of patients aged 1-6. Both the Kappa 
test and B-A plot demonstrated substantial consistency between the system and 
the reviewers, although the model encountered challenges in consistently 
distinguishing specific bones, such as the capitate. Furthermore, the system's 
performance proved acceptable across different genders and age groups, as well 
as radiography instruments.
CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center validation, the system showcased its potential 
to enhance the efficiency and consistency of healthy delivery, ultimately 
resulting in improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

BACKGROUND: Pneumonia can be anatomically classified into lobar, lobular, and 
interstitial types, with each type associated with different pathogens. 
Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the anatomical 
classifications of pneumonia and assist in refining the differential diagnosis 
may offer a more viable and clinically relevant solution. This study aimed to 
develop a multi-classification model capable of identifying the occurrence of 
pneumonia in patients by utilizing case-specific computed tomography (CT) 
information, categorizing the pneumonia type (lobar, lobular, and interstitial 
pneumonia), and performing segmentation of the associated lesions.
METHODS: A total of 61 lobar pneumonia patients, 60 lobular pneumonia patients, 
and 60 interstitial pneumonia patients were consecutively enrolled at our local 
hospital from June 2020 and May 2022. All selected cases were divided into a 
training cohort (n=135) and an independent testing cohort (n=46). To generate 
the ground truth labels for the training process, manual segmentation and 
labeling were performed by three junior radiologists. Subsequently, the 
segmentations were manually reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist. AI 
models were developed to automatically segment the infected lung regions and 
classify the pneumonia. The accuracy of pneumonia lesion segmentation was 
analyzed and evaluated using the Dice coefficient. Receiver operating 
characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC), 
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to assess the 
efficacy of pneumonia classification.
RESULTS: Our AI model achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.743 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.657-0.826] for lesion segmentation in the training set and 
0.723 (95% CI: 0.602-0.845) in the test set. In the test set, our model achieved 
an accuracy of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.876-0.978), precision of 0.889 (95% CI: 
0.827-0.951), sensitivity of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.827-0.951), specificity of 0.946 
(95% CI: 0.902-0.990), and AUC of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.969-1.000) for pneumonia 
classification. We trained the model using labels annotated by senior physicians 
and compared it to a model trained using labels annotated by junior physicians. 
The Dice coefficient of the model's segmentation improved by 0.014, increasing 
from 0.709 (95% CI: 0.589-0.830) to 0.723 (95% CI: 0.602-0.845), and the AUC 
improved by 0.042, rising from 0.947 to 0.989.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a robust multi-task learning model with 
substantial promise in enhancing the segmentation and classification of 
pneumonia in medical imaging.

BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients with suspected clinically 
significant prostate cancer (csPCa) are undergoing prostate multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). The role of artificial intelligence (AI) 
algorithms in interpreting prostate mpMRI needs to be tested with multicenter 
external data. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of an AI 
model in detecting and localizing visible csPCa on mpMRI a multicenter external 
data set.
METHODS: The data of 2,105 patients suspected of having prostate cancer from 
four hospitals were retrospectively collected to develop an AI model to detect 
and localize suspicious csPCa. The lesions were annotated based on pathology 
records by two radiologists. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent 
diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were used as the input for the 
three-dimensional U-Net framework. Subsequently, the model was validated using 
an external data set comprising the data of 557 patients from three hospitals. 
Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were employed to evaluate the diagnostic 
efficacy of the model.
RESULTS: At the lesion level, the model had a sensitivity of 0.654. At the 
overall sextant level, the model had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 
0.846, 0.884, and 0.874, respectively. At the patient level, the model had a 
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.943, 0.776, and 0.849, respectively. 
The AI-predicted accuracy for the csPCa patients (231/245, 0.943) was 
significantly higher than that for the non-csPCa patients (242/312, 0.776) 
(P<0.001). The lesion number and tumor volume were greater in the correctly 
diagnosed patients than the incorrectly diagnosed patients (both P<0.001). Among 
the positive patients, those with lower average ADC values had a higher rate of 
correct diagnosis than those with higher average ADC values (P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The AI model exhibited acceptable accuracy in detecting and 
localizing visible csPCa at the patient and sextant levels. However, further 
improvements need to be made to enhance the sensitivity of the model at the 
lesion level.

Outdoor air pollution has been found to have a significant adverse effect on 
health. When the authors attempted to monitor air quality that cyclists or 
e-scooter users' breath during commuting in different locations for health and 
safety analysis, it was found that the existence of internal combustion engine 
(ICE) cars has a significant effect on the pollution levels and the monitoring 
process. To comprehensively study the effect of cars and traffic on air quality 
that cyclists and e-scooters users experience, a low-cost and reliable system 
was needed to detect the proximity of cars that have diesel or petrol engines. 
Video cameras can be used to visually detect vehicles, but in the modern age 
with the existence of many electric and hybrid vehicles and the need to reduce 
the cost of instrumentation, there was a need to determine the passing of 
vehicles near e-scooter and bike users from the combined engine and tires 
sounds. To address this issue, this study suggests a novel approach of using 
sound waves of internal combustion engines and tire sounds during the passing of 
cars, combined with AI techniques (neural networks), to detect the proximity of 
cars from cyclists and e-scooter users. Audio-visual data was collected using 
Go-Pro cameras in order to combine the data with GPS location and pollution 
levels. Geographical data maps were produced to demonstrate the density of cars 
that cyclists encounter when on or near the road. This method will enable air 
quality monitoring research to detect the existence of ICE cars for future 
correlation with measured pollution levels. The proposed method allows for:•The 
automated selection of sensitive features from sound waves to detect 
vehicles.•Low-cost hardware which is independent of orientation that can be 
integrated with other air quality and GPS sensors.•The successful application of 
sensor fusion and neural networks.

The surge of genome sequencing data has underlined substantial genetic variants 
of uncertain significance (VUS). The decryption of VUS discovered by sequencing 
poses a major challenge in the post-sequencing era. Although experimental assays 
have progressed in classifying VUS, only a tiny fraction of the human genes have 
been explored experimentally. Thus, it is urgently needed to generate 
state-of-the-art functional predictors of VUS in silico. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) is an invaluable tool to assist in the identification of VUS with high 
efficiency and accuracy. An increasing number of studies indicate that AI has 
brought an exciting acceleration in the interpretation of VUS, and our group has 
already used AI to develop protein structure-based prediction models. In this 
review, we provide an overview of the previous research on AI-based prediction 
of missense variants, and elucidate the challenges and opportunities for protein 
structure-based variant prediction in the post-sequencing era.

In traditional medicine and ethnomedicine, medicinal plants have long been 
recognized as the basis for materials in therapeutic applications worldwide. In 
particular, the remarkable curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine 
during corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has attracted extensive 
attention globally. Medicinal plants have, therefore, become increasingly 
popular among the public. However, with increasing demand for and profit with 
medicinal plants, commercial fraudulent events such as adulteration or 
counterfeits sometimes occur, which poses a serious threat to the clinical 
outcomes and interests of consumers. With rapid advances in artificial 
intelligence, machine learning can be used to mine information on various 
medicinal plants to establish an ideal resource database. We herein present a 
review that mainly introduces common machine learning algorithms and discusses 
their application in multi-source data analysis of medicinal plants. The 
combination of machine learning algorithms and multi-source data analysis 
facilitates a comprehensive analysis and aids in the effective evaluation of the 
quality of medicinal plants. The findings of this review provide new 
possibilities for promoting the development and utilization of medicinal plants.

The existence of a very large number of porous materials is a great opportunity 
to develop innovative technologies for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture to address 
the climate change problem. On the other hand, identifying the most promising 
adsorbent and membrane candidates using iterative experimental testing and 
brute-force computer simulations is very challenging due to the enormous number 
and variety of porous materials. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been 
integrated into molecular modeling of porous materials, specifically 
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), to accelerate the design and discovery of 
high-performing adsorbents and membranes for CO2 adsorption and separation. In 
this perspective, we highlight the pioneering works in which AI, molecular 
simulations, and experiments have been combined to produce exceptional MOFs and 
MOF-based composites that outperform traditional porous materials in CO2 
capture. We outline the future directions by discussing the current 
opportunities and challenges in the field of harnessing experiments, theory, and 
AI for accelerated discovery of porous materials for CO2 capture.

BACKGROUND: Injury patterns in hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) are well 
recognised but there are few studies evaluating cerebral injury using 
neuroquantification models.
OBJECTIVES: Quantification of brain volumes in a group of patients with 
clinically determined cerebral palsy.
METHOD: In this retrospective study, 297 children with cerebral palsy were 
imaged for suspected HIBI with analysis of various cerebral substrates. Of 
these, 96 children over the age of 3 years with a clinical diagnosis of cerebral 
palsy and abnormal MRI findings underwent volumetric analyses using the 
NeuroQuant® software solution. The spectrum of volumetric changes and the 
differences between the various subtypes (and individual subgroups) of HIBI were 
compared.
RESULTS: Compared with the available normative NeuroQuant® database, the average 
intracranial volume was reduced to the 1st percentile in all patient groups (p < 
0.001). Statistically significant differences were observed among the types and 
subgroups of HIBI. Further substrate volume reductions were identified and 
described involving the thalami, brainstem, hippocampi, putamina and amygdala. 
The combined volumes of five regions of interest (frontal pole, putamen, 
hippocampus, brainstem and paracentral lobule) were consistently reduced in the 
Rolandic basal ganglia-thalamus (RBGT) subtype.
CONCLUSION: This study determined a quantifiable reduction of intracranial 
volume in all subtypes of HIBI and predictable selective cerebral substrate 
volume reduction in subtypes and subgroups. In the RBGT subtype, a key 
combination of five substrate injuries was consistently noted, and thalamic, 
occipital lobe and brainstem volume reduction was also significant when compared 
to the watershed subtype.
CONTRIBUTION: This study demonstrates the value of integrating an artificial 
intelligence programme into the radiologists' armamentarium serving to quantify 
brain injuries more accurately in HIBI. Going forward this will be an inevitable 
evolution of daily radiology practice in many fields of medicine, and it would 
be beneficial for radiologists to embrace these technological innovations.

BACKGROUND: In pursuit of applying universal non-biased Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) in healthcare, it is essential that data from different geographies are 
represented.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance of an AI-powered dermatological 
algorithm called Skin Image Search on Fitzpatrick 6 skin type (dark skin) 
dermatological conditions.
METHODS: 123 dermatological images selected from a total of 173 images were 
retrospectively extracted from the electronic database of a Ugandan telehealth 
company, The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG) after getting their consent. Details 
of age, gender, and dermatological clinical diagnosis were analysed using R on R 
studio software to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the AI app along with 
disease diagnosis and body part. Predictability levels of the AI app were graded 
on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0- no prediction was made and 1-5 demonstrated a 
reduction incorrect diagnosis prediction rate of the AI.
RESULTS: 76 (62%) of the dermatological images were from females and 47 (38%) 
from males. Overall diagnostic accuracy of the AI app on black dermatological 
conditions was low at 17% (21 out of 123 predictable images) compared to 69.9% 
performance on Caucasian skin type as reported from the training results. There 
were varying predictability levels correctness i.e., 1-8.9%, 2-2.4%, 3-2.4%, 
4-1.6%, 5-1.6% with performance along individual diagnosis highest with 
dermatitis (80%).
CONCLUSION: There is need for diversity of image datasets used to train 
dermatology algorithms for AI applications to increase accuracy across skin 
types and geographies.

Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging plays a significant role in the detection 
and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). With recent advancements in 
computer power and the availability of digital archives, artificial intelligence 
(AI) is rapidly gaining traction in the field of medical imaging, including 
nuclear medicine and molecular imaging. However, the complex and time-consuming 
workflow and interpretation involved in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, 
limit their extensive utilization in clinical practice. To address this 
challenge, AI has emerged as a fundamental tool for enhancing the role of 
nuclear medicine and molecular imaging. It has shown promising applications in 
various crucial aspects of nuclear cardiology, such as optimizing imaging 
protocols, facilitating data processing, aiding in CVD diagnosis, risk 
classification and prognosis. In this review paper, we will introduce the key 
concepts of AI and provide an overview of its current progress in the field of 
nuclear cardiology. In addition, we will discuss future perspectives for AI in 
this domain.

BACKGROUND: The health care system is undergoing a shift toward a more 
patient-centered approach for individuals with chronic and complex conditions, 
which presents a series of challenges, such as predicting hospital needs and 
optimizing resources. At the same time, the exponential increase in health data 
availability has made it possible to apply advanced statistics and artificial 
intelligence techniques to develop decision-support systems and improve resource 
planning, diagnosis, and patient screening. These methods are key to automating 
the analysis of large volumes of medical data and reducing professional 
workloads.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to present a machine learning model and a case 
study in a cohort of patients with highly complex conditions. The object was to 
predict mortality within the following 4 years and early mortality over 6 months 
following diagnosis. The method used easily accessible variables and health care 
resource utilization information.
METHODS: A classification algorithm was selected among 6 models implemented and 
evaluated using a stratified cross-validation strategy with k=10 and a 70/30 
train-test split. The evaluation metrics used included accuracy, recall, 
precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) curve.
RESULTS: The model predicted patient death with an 87% accuracy, recall of 87%, 
precision of 82%, F1-score of 84%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 using 
the best model, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. The results 
were worse when predicting premature deaths (following 6 months) with an 83% 
accuracy (recall=55%, precision=64% F1-score=57%, and AUC=0.88) using the 
Gradient Boosting (GRBoost) classifier.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showcases encouraging outcomes in forecasting mortality 
among patients with intricate and persistent health conditions. The employed 
variables are conveniently accessible, and the incorporation of health care 
resource utilization information of the patient, which has not been employed by 
current state-of-the-art approaches, displays promising predictive power. The 
proposed prediction model is designed to efficiently identify cases that need 
customized care and proactively anticipate the demand for critical resources by 
health care providers.

One of the significant challenges to designing an emulsion transportation system 
is predicting frictional pressure losses with confidence. The state-of-the-art 
method for enhancing reliability in prediction is to employ artificial 
intelligence (AI) based on various machine learning (ML) tools. Six traditional 
and tree-based ML algorithms were analyzed for the prediction in the current 
study. A rigorous feature importance study using RFECV method and relevant 
statistical analysis was conducted to identify the parameters that significantly 
contributed to the prediction. Among 16 input variables, the fluid velocity, 
mass flow rate, and pipe diameter were evaluated as the top predictors to 
estimate the frictional pressure losses. The significance of the contributing 
parameters was further validated by estimation error trend analyses. A 
comprehensive assessment of the regression models demonstrated an ensemble of 
the top three regressors to excel over all other ML and theoretical models. The 
ensemble regressor showcased exceptional performance, as evidenced by its high 
R2 value of 99.7 % and an AUC-ROC score of 98 %. These results were 
statistically significant, as there was a noticeable difference (within a 95 % 
confidence interval) compared to the estimations of the three base models. In 
terms of estimation error, the ensemble model outperformed the top base 
regressor by demonstrating improvements of 6.6 %, 11.1 %, and 12.75 % for the 
RMSE, MAE, and CV_MSE evaluation metrics, respectively. The precise and robust 
estimations achieved by the best regression model in this study further 
highlight the effectiveness of AI in the field of pipeline engineering.

Why are ravens smart? Exploring the social intelligence hypothesis.

Ravens and other corvids are renowned for their 'intelligence'. For long, this 
reputation has been based primarily on anecdotes but in the last decades 
experimental evidence for impressive cognitive skills has accumulated within and 
across species. While we begin to understand the building blocks of corvid 
cognition, the question remains why these birds have evolved such skills. 
Focusing on Northern Ravens Corvus corax, I here try to tackle this question by 
relating current hypotheses on brain evolution to recent empirical data on 
challenges faced in the birds' daily life. Results show that foraging ravens 
meet several assumptions for applying social intelligence: (1) they meet 
repeatedly at foraging sites, albeit individuals have different site preferences 
and vary in grouping dynamics; (1) foraging groups are structured by dominance 
rank hierarchies and social bonds; (3) individual ravens memorize former group 
members and their relationship valence over years, deduce third-party 
relationships and use their social knowledge in daily life by supporting others 
in conflicts and intervening in others' affiliations. Hence, ravens' 
socio-cognitive skills may be strongly shaped by the 'complex' social 
environment experienced as non-breeders.

Publisher: Raben und ihre Verwandtschaft gelten gemeinhin als „kluge“ Vögel. 
Lange beruhte ihr Ruf weitgehend auf Anekdoten, erst in den letzten Jahrzehnten 
wurden ihre beeindruckenden kognitiven Fähigkeiten auch in 
Verhaltensexperimenten nachgewiesen. Während wir immer besser die kognitiven 
Bausteine von „Raben-Intelligenz“ verstehen, bleibt die Frage offen, warum diese 
Vögel derartig leistungsstarke Gehirne entwickelt haben. In diesem Artikel gehe 
ich dieser Frage an Kolkraben Corvus corax nach, indem ich gängige Hypothesen 
zur Evolution von Intelligenz mit rezenten empirischen Daten über Anforderungen 
im täglichen Leben von Raben in Beziehung setze. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass 
Gruppen nahrungssuchender Raben sämtlichen Annahmen der Sozialen Intelligenz 
Hypothese entsprechen: Individuen treffen einander widerholt an Nahrungsplätzen, 
wobei sie unterschiedliche Präferenzen für bestimmte Plätze zeigen und somit in 
der Gruppendynamik variieren; die Gruppen zeichnen sich durch Dominanzstrukturen 
und soziale Beziehungen aus; einzelne Raben erinnern sich an die Wertigkeit 
ihrer Beziehungen über Jahre, erkennen Beziehungen anderer und nützen ihr 
soziales Wissen im täglichen Leben, indem sie in Konflikte anderer eingreifen 
und sich in die Beziehungen anderer einmischen. Die sozio-kognitiven Fähigkeiten 
von Raben könnten daher stark durch die „komplexe“ soziale Umwelt geformt 
werden, die sie als Nichtbrüter erleben.

The study unfolds with an acknowledgment of the extensive exploration of TRIZ 
components, spanning a solid philosophy, quantitative and inductive methods, and 
practical tools, over the years. While the adoption of Semantic TRIZ (S-TRIZ) in 
high-tech industries for system development, innovation, and production has 
increased, the application of AI technologies to specific TRIZ components 
remains unexplored. This systematic literature review is conducted to delve into 
the detailed integration of AI with TRIZ, particularly S-TRIZ. The results 
elucidate the current state of AI applications within TRIZ, identifying focal 
TRIZ components and areas requiring further study. Additionally, the study 
highlights the trending AI technologies in this context. This exploration serves 
as a foundational resource for researchers, developers, and inventors, providing 
valuable insights into the integration of AI technologies with TRIZ concepts. 
The study not only paves the way for the development and automation of S-TRIZ 
but also outlines limitations for future research, guiding the trajectory of 
advancements in this interdisciplinary field.

The quantified measurement and comprehensive analysis of artificial intelligence 
development (AIDEV) are vital for countries to form AI industrial ecology and 
promote the long-term development of regional AI technology. Based on the 
innovation ecosystems (IE) theory, this paper constructs an evaluation system to 
measure and analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic evolution of the 
AIDEV in China from 2011 to 2020. The results show that the AIDEV of China 
presents an overall upward trend and an obvious unbalance in the spatial 
distribution which is "eastern > central > western". Meanwhile, the provinces of 
low-level AIDEV are catching up with the high-level provinces, which leads to 
the regional difference of AIDEV narrowing. Moreover, the concentration and 
polarization phenomenon of AIDEV in China has been weakening and the AIDEV will 
continue to increase in the next three years. Further, there is a significantly 
positive spatial autocorrelation of AIDEV. Finally, high AIDEV provinces will 
increase the probability of surrounding provinces' AIDEV to develop. This paper 
expands the research stream in the field of AI research, extends the application 
scenarios of IE theory, and puts forward some relevant policy recommendations.
