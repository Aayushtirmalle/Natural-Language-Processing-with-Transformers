Abstract: Immunocheckpoint inhibitors have shown impressive efficacy in patients with colon cancer and other types of solid tumor that are mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR). Currently, PCR-capillary electrophoresis is one of the mainstream detection methods for dMMR, but its accuracy is still limited by germline mismatch repair (MMR) mutations, the functional redundancy of the MMR system, and abnormal methylation of MutL Homolog 1 promoter. Therefore, this study aimed to develop new biomarkers for dMMR based on artificial intelligence (AI) and pathologic images, which may help to improve the detection accuracy. To screen for the differential expression genes (DEGs) in dMMR patients and validate their diagnostic and prognostic efficiency, we used the expression profile data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The results showed that the expression of Immunoglobulin Lambda Joining 3 in dMMR patients was significantly downregulated and negatively correlated with the prognosis. Meanwhile, our diagnostic models based on pathologic image features showed good performance with area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.73, 0.86, and 0.81 in the training, test, and external validation sets (Jiangsu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital cohort). Based on gene expression and pathologic characteristics, we developed an effective prognosis model for dMMR patients through multiple Cox regression analysis (with AUC values of 0.88, 0.89, and 0.88 at 1-, 3-, and 5-year intervals, respectively). In conclusion, our results showed that Immunoglobulin Lambda Joining 3 and nucleus shape-related parameters (such as nuclear texture, nuclear eccentricity, nuclear size, and nuclear pixel intensity) were independent diagnostic and prognostic factors, suggesting that they could be used as new biomarkers for dMMR patients.

Abstract: Sustainable production aims at creating products from processes that minimize environmental impact, energy consumption and natural resources. Customers and markets are ever more leaning towards digital, custom, and flexible solutions with lower environmental impact. Hence, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) solutions are increasingly including social and environmental sustainability aspects. We focus on the realization of an infrastructure integrating industrially relevant application modules by combining system reconfigurability and artificial intelligence, towards sustainable production. To meet the final goal of sustainable production, we address four challenges considering flexibility and sustainability in production in a holistic way: (1) developing infrastructural and methodological tools to support companies to explore the potential of I4.0 towards sustainable production; (2) managing the configurability and customization possibilities of products; (3) effectively handling the flexibility provided by a production system with rapid reconfiguration capabilities; (4) integrating hardware and software flexibility by using reconfigurable robotics and machine learning methods. By developing and connecting different application modules, we obtain a physical demonstrator which represents on the one hand an exemplary scenario of reconfigurable and flexible production system; on the other, it enables new research activities and insights with a see, touch & feel approach for industrial and research realities.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of visiting health services has been proven to be effective in promoting the health of older populations. Hence, developing a web system for nurses may help improve the quality of visiting health services for community-dwelling frail older adults. This study was conducted to develop a web application that reflects the needs of visiting nurses. METHODS: Visiting nurses of public health centers and community centers in South Korea participated in the design and evaluation process. Six nurses took part in the focus group interviews, and 21 visiting nurses and community center managers participated in the satisfaction evaluation. Focus group interviews were conducted to identify the needs of visiting nurses with respect to system function. Based on the findings, a web application that can support the effective delivery of home visiting services in the community was developed. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was also developed to recommend health and welfare services according to each patient's health status. After development, a structured survey was conducted to evaluate user satisfaction with system features using Kano's model. RESULTS: The new system can be used with mobile devices to increase the mobility of visiting nurses. The system includes 13 features that support the management of patient data and enhance the efficiency of visiting services (e.g., map, navigation, scheduler, protocol archives, professional advice, and online case conferencing). The user satisfaction survey revealed that nurses showed high satisfaction with the system. Among all features, the nurses were most satisfied with the care plan, which included AI-based recommendations for community referral. CONCLUSIONS: The system developed from the study has attractive features for visiting nurses and supports their essential tasks. The system can help with effective case management for older adults requiring in-home care and reduce nurses' workload. It can also improve communication and networking between healthcare and long-term care institutions.

Title: Prognostic modelling in IBD.
Author: ['Rimmer P', 'Iqbal T']
Journal Title: Best practice & research. Clinical gastroenterology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: In the ideal world prognostication or predicting disease course in any chronic condition would allow the clinician to anticipate disease behaviour, providing crucial information for the patient and data regarding best use of resources. Prognostication also allows an understanding of likely response to treatment and the risk of adverse effects of a treatment leading to withdrawal in any individual patient. Therefore, the ability to predict outcomes from the onset of disease is the key step to developing precision personalised medicine, which is the design of medical care to optimise efficiency or therapeutic benefit based on careful profiling of patients. An important corollary is to prevent unnecessary healthcare costs. This paper outlines currently available predictors of disease outcome in IBD and looks to the future which will involve the use of artificial intelligence to interrogate big data derived from various important 'omes' to tease out a more holistic approach to IBD.

Abstract: Cirrhosis is a major cause of death worldwide, and is associated with significant health care costs. Even if milestones have been recently reached in understanding and managing end-stage liver disease (ESLD), the disease course remains somewhat difficult to prognosticate. These difficulties have already been acknowledged already in the past, when scores instead of single parameters have been proposed as valuable tools for short-term prognosis. These standard scores, like Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, relying on biochemical and clinical parameters, are still widely used in clinical practice to predict short- and medium-term prognosis. The MELD score, which remains an accurate, easy-to-use, objective predictive score, has received significant modifications over time, in order to improve its performance especially in the liver transplant (LT) setting, where it is widely used as prioritization tool. Although many attempts to improve prognostic accuracy have failed because of lack of replicability or poor benefit with the comparator (often the MELD score or its variants), few scores have been recently proposed and validated especially for subgroups of patients with ESLD, as those with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Artificial intelligence will probably help hepatologists in the near future to fill the current gaps in predicting disease course and long-term prognosis of such patients.

Abstract: Valvular heart diseases (VHDs) significantly impact morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Early diagnosis improves patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation presents a promising approach for early VHD detection. We conducted a meta-analysis on the efficacy of AI models in this context. We reviewed databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane until August 20, 2023, focusing on AI for ECG-based VHD detection. The outcomes included pooled accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value. The pooled proportions were derived using a random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study heterogeneity was evaluated with the I-squared statistic. Our analysis included 10 studies, involving ECG data from 713,537 patients. The AI algorithms mainly screened for aortic stenosis (n = 6), mitral regurgitation (n = 4), aortic regurgitation (n = 3), mitral stenosis (n = 1), mitral valve prolapse (n = 2), and tricuspid regurgitation (n = 1). A total of 9 studies used convolution neural network models, whereas 1 study combined the strengths of support vector machine logistic regression and multilayer perceptron for ECG interpretation. The collective AI models demonstrated a pooled accuracy of 81% (95% CI 73 to 89, I((2)) = 92%), sensitivity was 83% (95% CI 77 to 88, I((2)) = 86%), specificity was 72% (95% CI 68 to 75, I((2)) = 52%), PPV was 13% (95% CI 7 to 19, I((2)) = 90%), and negative predictive value was 99% (95% CI 97 to 99, I((2)) = 50%). The subgroup analyses for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation detection yielded analogous outcomes. In conclusion, AI-driven ECG offers high accuracy in VHD screening. However, its low PPV indicates the need for a combined approach with clinical judgment, especially in primary care settings.

Title: Modeling Brain Representations of Words' Concreteness in Context Using GPT-2 and Human Ratings.
Author: ['Bruera A', 'Tao Y', 'Anderson A', 'Cokal D', 'Haber J', 'Poesio M']
Journal Title: Cognitive science
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: The meaning of most words in language depends on their context. Understanding how the human brain extracts contextualized meaning, and identifying where in the brain this takes place, remain important scientific challenges. But technological and computational advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence now provide unprecedented opportunities to study the human brain in action as language is read and understood. Recent contextualized language models seem to be able to capture homonymic meaning variation ("bat", in a baseball vs. a vampire context), as well as more nuanced differences of meaning-for example, polysemous words such as "book", which can be interpreted in distinct but related senses ("explain a book", information, vs. "open a book", object) whose differences are fine-grained. We study these subtle differences in lexical meaning along the concrete/abstract dimension, as they are triggered by verb-noun semantic composition. We analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations elicited by Italian verb phrases containing nouns whose interpretation is affected by the verb to different degrees. By using a contextualized language model and human concreteness ratings, we shed light on where in the brain such fine-grained meaning variation takes place and how it is coded. Our results show that phrase concreteness judgments and the contextualized model can predict BOLD activation associated with semantic composition within the language network. Importantly, representations derived from a complex, nonlinear composition process consistently outperform simpler composition approaches. This is compatible with a holistic view of semantic composition in the brain, where semantic representations are modified by the process of composition itself. When looking at individual brain areas, we find that encoding performance is statistically significant, although with differing patterns of results, suggesting differential involvement, in the posterior superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus and anterior temporal lobe, and in motor areas previously associated with processing of concreteness/abstractness.

Abstract: Technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have the potential to expedite the goal of precision medicine, especially when combined with increased capacity for voluminous data from multiple sources and expanded therapeutic modalities; however, they also present several challenges. In this communication, we first discuss the goals of precision medicine, and contextualize the use of AI in precision medicine by showcasing innovative applications (e.g., prediction of tumor growth and overall survival, biomarker identification using biomedical images, and identification of patient population for clinical practice) which were presented during the February 2023 virtual public workshop entitled "Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Precision Medicine," hosted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI). Next, we put forward challenges brought about by the multidisciplinary nature of AI, particularly highlighting the need for AI to be trustworthy. To address such challenges, we subsequently note practical approaches, viz., differential privacy, synthetic data generation, and federated learning. The proposed strategies - some of which are highlighted presentations from the workshop - are for the protection of personal information and intellectual property. In addition, methods such as the risk-based management approach and the need for an agile regulatory ecosystem are discussed. Finally, we lay out a call for action that includes sharing of data and algorithms, development of regulatory guidance documents, and pooling of expertise from a broad-spectrum of stakeholders to enhance the application of AI in precision medicine.

Journal Title: Veterinary research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) was developed to distinguish cattle by their muzzle patterns and identify early cases of disease, including infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK). It was tested on 870 cattle in four locations, with 170 developing IBK. The AI identified 169 of the 170 cases prior to their identification by veterinarians, and another 17 cases that remained free of IBK signs (sensitivity = 99.4%, specificity = 97.6%). These results indicate the AI can detect emerging IBK cases by muzzle images very early in the disease process and be used as an intervention tool in the prevention of IBK outbreaks.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Policymakers require precise and in-time information to make informed decisions in complex environments such as health systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a novel approach that makes collecting and analyzing data in complex systems more accessible. This study highlights recent research on AI's application and capabilities in health policymaking. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases to find relevant studies from 2000 to 2023, using the keywords "artificial intelligence" and "policymaking." We used Walt and Gilson's policy triangle framework for charting the data. RESULTS: The results revealed that using AI in health policy paved the way for novel analyses and innovative solutions for intelligent decision-making and data collection, potentially enhancing policymaking capacities, particularly in the evaluation phase. It can also be employed to create innovative agendas with fewer political constraints and greater rationality, resulting in evidence-based policies. By creating new platforms and toolkits, AI also offers the chance to make judgments based on solid facts. The majority of the proposed AI solutions for health policy aim to improve decision-making rather than replace experts. CONCLUSION: Numerous approaches exist for AI to influence the health policymaking process. Health systems can benefit from AI's potential to foster the meaningful use of evidence-based policymaking.

Journal Title: BMC oral health
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate age estimation is vital for clinical and forensic purposes. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence(AI) technologies, traditional methods relying on tooth development, while reliable, can be enhanced by leveraging deep learning, particularly neural networks. This study evaluated the efficiency of an AI model by applying the entire panoramic image for age estimation. The outcome performances were analyzed through supervised learning (SL) models. METHODS: Total of 27,877 dental panorama images from 5 to 90 years of age were classified by 2 types of grouping. In type 1 they were classified by each age and in type 2, applying heuristic grouping, the age over 20 years were classified by every 5 years. Wide ResNet (WRN) and DenseNet (DN) were used for supervised learning. In addition, the analysis with +/- 3 years of deviation in both types were performed. RESULTS: For the DN model, while the type 1 grouping achieved an accuracy of 0.1016 and F1 score of 0.058, the type 2 achieved an accuracy of 0.3146 and F1 score of 0.2027. Incorporating +/- 3years of deviation, the accuracy of type 1 and 2 were 0.281, 0.7323 respectively; and the F1 score were 0.1768, 0.6583 respectively. For the WRN model, while the type 1 grouping achieved an accuracy of 0.1041 and F1 score of 0.0599, the type 2 achieved an accuracy of 0.3182 and F1 score of 0.2071. Incorporating +/- 3years of deviation, the accuracy of type 1 and 2 were 0.2716, 0.7323 respectively; and the F1 score were 0.1709, 0.6437 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The application of entire panorama image data for supervised with classification by heuristics grouping with +/- 3years of deviation for supervised learning models and demonstrated satisfactory outcome for the age estimation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Delay in diagnosis can contribute to poor outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and new tools for early detection are required. Recent application of artificial intelligence to cancer imaging has demonstrated great potential in detecting subtle early lesions. The aim of the study was to evaluate global and local accuracies of deep neural network (DNN) segmentation of normal and abnormal pancreas with pancreatic mass. METHODS: Our previously developed and reported residual deep supervision network for segmentation of PDAC was applied to segment pancreas using CT images of potential renal donors (normal pancreas) and patients with suspected PDAC (abnormal pancreas). Accuracy of DNN pancreas segmentation was assessed using DICE simulation coefficient (DSC), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Hausdorff distance 95% percentile (HD95) as compared to manual segmentation. Furthermore, two radiologists semi-quantitatively assessed local accuracies and estimated volume of correctly segmented pancreas. RESULTS: Forty-two normal and 49 abnormal CTs were assessed. Average DSC was 87.4 +/- 3.1% and 85.5 +/- 3.2%, ASSD 0.97 +/- 0.30 and 1.34 +/- 0.65, HD95 4.28 +/- 2.36 and 6.31 +/- 6.31 for normal and abnormal pancreas, respectively. Semi-quantitatively, >/=95% of pancreas volume was correctly segmented in 95.2% and 53.1% of normal and abnormal pancreas by both radiologists, and 97.6% and 75.5% by at least one radiologist. Most common segmentation errors were made on pancreatic and duodenal borders in both groups, and related to pancreatic tumor including duct dilatation, atrophy, tumor infiltration and collateral vessels. CONCLUSION: Pancreas DNN segmentation is accurate in a majority of cases, however, minor manual editing may be necessary; particularly in abnormal pancreas.

Journal Title: The journal of applied laboratory medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to become an important tool in the practice of laboratory medicine. AI programs are available online that can provide concise medical and laboratory information within seconds after a question is submitted. METHODS: We posed the following contemporary and relevant question for clinical chemists using an AI program: "Should labs eliminate CK-MB testing?" The results of this inquiry were critically reviewed by a cardiologist, emergency department physician, and clinical laboratorians for accuracy and appropriateness. RESULTS: An AI report answering this question was generated within 15 s. The experts felt that the information was inaccurate with the statements that CK-MB results are released earlier than cardiac troponin (cTn), and are more useful for detection of myocardial injury in patients with renal insufficiencies. The summary omitted discussion on the ongoing debate for periprocedural detection of acute myocardial infarction (MI), the perceived value for detection of reinfarction, the value in risk stratification compared to cTn, the economic justification for testing both CK-MB and cTn, and medicolegal aspects of testing when results are discordant. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, AI does not appear to be ready to be used by clinical laboratories for answering important practice questions.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: Recent progress in the realm of artificial intelligence has shown effectiveness in various industries, particularly within the healthcare sector. However, there are limited insights on existing studies regarding ethical, social, privacy, and technological aspects of AI in the health sector, which is the gap our study aims to fill. This study aimed to synthesize empirical studies on the challenges and opportunities of using AI by conducting a systematic review. We reviewed 33 articles published between 2015 and 2022 in the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct databases. The results show that artificial intelligence has the promise of improving health care and faces obstacles when implemented. Most of the reviewed studies indicated that the use of AI provides several opportunities, including teamwork and decision-making, technological advancement, diagnosis and patient monitoring, drug development, and virtual health assistance. However, the findings show that the use of AI in the health sector hinders multifaceted challenges, including ethical and privacy-related issues, lack of awareness, unreliability of technology, and professional liability. The findings highlight that artificial intelligence has the potential to transform healthcare and that addressing these challenges is crucial to fully utilize its potential.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women and those assigned female at birth. However, it takes 6.4 years to diagnose using the conventional standard of laparoscopy. Non-invasive imaging enables a timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay as well as the risk and expense of surgery. This review updates the exponentially increasing literature exploring the diagnostic value of endometriosis specialist transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS), combinations of eTVUS and specialist magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Concentrating on literature that emerged after publication of the IDEA consensus in 2016, we identified 6192 publications, and reviewed 49 studies focused on diagnosing endometriosis using emerging imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of eTVUS continues to improve but there are still limitations. eTVUS reliably detects OE and shows high specificity for deep endometriosis (DE) and should be considered diagnostic. However, a negative scan cannot preclude endometriosis as eTVUS shows moderate sensitivity scores for DE and the sonographic evaluation of superficial endometriosis is still in its infancy. The fast growing area of AI in endometriosis detection is still evolving, but shows great promise, particularly in the area of combined multimodal techniques. We finalise our commentary by exploring the implications for practice change for surgeons, sonographers, radiologists, and fertility specialists. Direct benefits for endometriosis patients include reduced diagnostic delay, better access to targeted therapeutics, higher quality operative procedures and improved fertility treatment plans.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The selection of treatment for maxillary expansion is closely related to the calcification degree of the midpalatal suture. A classification method for individual assessment of the morphology of midpalatal suture in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is useful for evaluating the calcification degree. Currently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been introduced into the field of oral and maxillofacial imaging diagnosis. This study validated the ability of CNN models in assessing the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture. METHODS: The existing CNN model ResNet50 was trained to locate the CBCT transverse plane which contained a complete midpalatal suture. ResNet18, ResNet50, RessNet101, Inception-v3, and Efficientnetv2-s models were trained to evaluate the midpalatal suture maturation stage. Multi-class classification metrics, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and area under the curve values from the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to evaluate the performance of the models, and gradient-weighted class activation map technology was utilised to visualise five midpalatal suture maturation stages for each model. RESULTS: Resnet50 demonstrated an accuracy of 99.74 % in identifying the transverse plane that contained the complete midpalatal suture. The highest accuracies achieved on the two-stage, three-stage, and five-stage maturation classification tests were 95.15, 88.06, and 75.37 %, all of which exceeded the average accuracy of three experienced orthodontists. CONCLUSIONS: The CNN model can locate the plane of the midpalatal suture in CBCT images and can assist clinicians in assessing the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture to select the means of maxillary expansion. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The application of artificial intelligence on CBCT midpalatal suture plane localisation and maturation stage evaluation enhances diagnostic and treatment efficiency and accuracy of individual assessment of midpalatal suture calcification degree. Additionally, it assists the clinical palatal expansion technique in achieving ideal results.

In the field of structural biology, no single method comprehensively reveals the behavior of biological systems across various spatiotemporal scales. Instead, we have a versatile toolkit of techniques, each contributing a piece to the overall puzzle. Integrative structural biology combines different techniques to create accurate and precise multi-scale models that expand our understanding of complex biological systems. This review outlines recent advancements in computational and experimental methods in structural biology, with special focus on recent Artificial Intelligence techniques, emphasizes integrative approaches that combine different types of data for precise spatiotemporal modeling, and provides an outlook into future directions of this field.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Stimulated Raman histology is an innovative technology that generates real-time, high-resolution microscopic images of unprocessed tissue, significantly reducing prostate biopsy interpretation time. This study aims to evaluate the ability for an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to interpretate prostate biopsy histologic images created with stimulated Raman histology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unprocessed, unlabeled prostate biopsies were prospectively imaged using a stimulated Raman histology microscope. Following stimulated Raman histology creation, the cores underwent standard pathological processing and interpretation by at least 2 genitourinary pathologists to establish a ground truth assessment. A network, trained on 303 prostate biopsies from 100 participants, was used to measure the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of detecting prostate cancer on stimulated Raman histology relative to conventional pathology. The performance of the artificial intelligence was evaluated on an independent 113-biopsy test set. RESULTS: Prostate biopsy images obtained through stimulated Raman histology can be generated within a time frame of 2 to 2.75 minutes. The artificial intelligence system achieved a rapid classification of prostate biopsies with cancer, with a potential identification time of approximately 1 minute. The artificial intelligence demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 96.5% in detecting prostate cancer. Moreover, the artificial intelligence exhibited a sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 96.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulated Raman histology generates microscopic images capable of accurately identifying prostate cancer in real time, without the need for sectioning or tissue processing. These images can be interpreted by artificial intelligence, providing physicians with near-real-time pathological feedback during the diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a malignancy among women worldwide, which is responsible for innumerable deaths every year. The primary objective of this review study is to offer a comprehensive and synthesized overview of the existing literature concerning digital interventions in cervical cancer care. As such, we aim to uncover prevalent research gaps and highlight prospective avenues for future investigations. METHODS: This study adopted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology where a total of 26 articles were reviewed from an initial set of 1110 articles following an inclusion-exclusion criterion. RESULTS: The review highlights a deficiency in existing studies that address awareness dissemination, screening facilitation, and treatment provision for cervical cancer. The review also reveals future research opportunities like explore innovative approaches using emerging technologies to enhance awareness campaigns and treatment accessibility, consider diverse study contexts, develop sophisticated machine learning models for screening, incorporate additional features in machine learning research, investigate the impact of treatments across different stages of cervical cancer, and create more user-friendly applications for cervical cancer care. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study can contribute to mitigating the adverse effects of cervical cancer and improving patient outcomes. It also highlights the untapped potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which could significantly impact our society.
