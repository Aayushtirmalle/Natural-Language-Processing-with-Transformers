Journal Title: World journal of clinical oncology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 24
Abstract: Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma has a favorable prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of over 95%. However, the undifferentiated or anaplastic type accounting for < 0.2%, usually in elderly individuals, exhibits a dismal prognosis with rapid growth and disappointing outcomes. It is the most aggressive form of thyroid carcinoma, with a median survival of 5 mo and poor quality of life (airway obstruction, dysphagia, hoarseness, persistent pain). Early diagnosis and staging are crucial. Diagnostic tools include biopsy (fine needle aspiration, core needle, open surgery), high-resolution ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, [(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomo-graphy/computed tomography, liquid biopsy and microRNAs. The BRAF gene (BRAF-V600E and BRAF wild type) is the most often found molecular factor. Others include the genes RET, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. Recent management policy is based on surgery, even debulking, chemotherapy (cisplatin or doxorubicin), radiotherapy (adjuvant or definitive), targeted biological agents and immunotherapy. The last two options constitute novel hopeful management modalities improving the overall survival in these otherwise condemned patients. Anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody immunotherapy, stem cell targeted therapies, nanotechnology achievements and artificial intelligence imple-mentation provide novel promising alternatives. Genetic mutations determine molecular pathways, thus indicating novel treatment strategies such as anti-BRAF, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor. Treatment with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in cases with BRAF-V600E gene mutations and is currently the standard care. This neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery ensures a two-year overall survival of 80%. Prognostic factors for improved outcomes have been found to be younger age, earlier tumor stage and radiation therapy. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary, and the therapeutic plan should be individualized based on surveillance and epidemiology end results.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Dental radiographs are essential in the diagnostic process in dentistry. They serve various purposes, including determining age, analyzing patterns of tooth eruption/shedding, and treatment planning and prognosis. The emergence of digital radiography technology has piqued interest in using artificial intelligence systems to assist and guide dental professionals. These cutting-edge technologies assist in streamlining decision-making processes by enabling entity classification and localization tasks. With the integration of artificial Intelligence algorithms tailored for pediatric dentistry applications and utilizing automated tools, there is an optimistic outlook on improving diagnostic capabilities while reducing stress and fatigue among clinicians. METHODOLOGY: The dataset comprised 620 images (mixed dentition: 314, permanent dentition: 306). Panoramic radiographs taken were within the age range of 4-16 years. The classification of deciduous and permanent teeth involved training CNN-based models using different architectures such as Resnet, AlexNet, and EfficientNet, among others. A ratio of 70:15:15 was utilized for training, validation, and testing, respectively. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that among the models proposed, EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 exhibited superior performance. Both EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 achieved an accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98% in classifying teeth as either deciduous or permanent. This implies that these models were highly accurate in identifying patterns/features within the dataset used for evaluation.

Title: Reduction in Retinal Ganglion Cell Layer, Inner Plexiform Layer, and Choroidal Thickness in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Author: ['Kara MZ', 'Orum MH', 'Karadag AS', 'Kalenderoglu A', 'Kara A']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: PURPOSES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), choroidal layer, inner plexiform layer (IPL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: In this study, we measured the thickness of the RNFL, GCL, IPL, and choroidal thickness using a spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT) device and we compared the results between the children diagnosed with ASD and healthy controls. Correlation between the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the OCT data was evaluated. RESULTS: Both ASD and control group consisted of 40 subjects (30 males and 10 females). Of the children in the ASD group, 29 had normal intelligence and 11 had mild intellectual disability (MID). The mean age of patients in the ASD group and control groups were 9.77 +/- 3.37 years and 9.85 +/- 3.97 years (p = 0.928). There was a statistically significant difference between the ASD group and the control group in the nasal and nasal-superior sectors of the RNFL layers in the left eye when all the lower layers of RNFL were assessed. In both eyes, the children with ASD had considerably lower mean choroidal thicknesses than the controls. When compared to the controls, the GCL and IPL volumes in the individuals with ASD were considerably lower in both eyes. Compared to the MID group, the left GCL volume of the nasal-inferior group was noticeably higher. A significant correlation was found between CARS scores and left GCL left IPL. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to RNFL in the ASD group, significant reductions in IPL, GCL, and choroidal thickness were observed in both eyes. It is thought that GCL may be a much more important biomarker than RNFL in terms of representing the structural deterioration in the brain. In addition, these results may form the basis for a new perspective on the use of OCT for the diagnosis and clinical course of autism.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Missing occult cancer lesions accounts for the most diagnostic errors in retrospective radiology reviews as early cancer can be small or subtle, making the lesions difficult to detect. Second-observer is the most effective technique for reducing these events and can be economically implemented with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). AIM: To achieve appropriate AI model training, a large annotated dataset is necessary to train the AI models. Our goal in this research is to compare two methods for decreasing the annotation time to establish ground truth: Skip-slice annotation and AI-initiated annotation. METHODS: We developed a 2D U-Net as an AI second observer for detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) and an ensemble of 5 differently initiated 2D U-Net for ensemble technique. Each model was trained with 51 cases of annotated CRC computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, tested with 7 cases, and validated with 20 cases from The Cancer Imaging Archive cases. The sensitivity, false positives per case, and estimated Dice coefficient were obtained for each method of training. We compared the two methods of annotations and the time reduction associated with the technique. The time differences were tested using Friedman's two-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Sparse annotation significantly reduces the time for annotation particularly skipping 2 slices at a time (P < 0.001). Reduction of up to 2/3 of the annotation does not reduce AI model sensitivity or false positives per case. Although initializing human annotation with AI reduces the annotation time, the reduction is minimal, even when using an ensemble AI to decrease false positives. CONCLUSION: Our data support the sparse annotation technique as an efficient technique for reducing the time needed to establish the ground truth.

Journal Title: View (Beijing, China)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Radiomics aims to develop novel biomarkers and provide relevant deeper subvisual information about pathology, immunophenotype, and tumor microenvironment. It uses automated or semiautomated quantitative analysis of high-dimensional images to improve characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis. Recent years have seen a rapid increase in radiomics applications in nuclear medicine, leading to some promising research results in digestive system oncology, which have been driven by big data analysis and the development of artificial intelligence. Although radiomics advances one step further toward the non-invasive precision medical analysis, it is still a step away from clinical application and faces many challenges. This review article summarizes the available literature on digestive system tumors regarding radiomics in nuclear medicine. First, we describe the workflow and steps involved in radiomics analysis. Subsequently, we discuss the progress in clinical application regarding the utilization of radiomics for distinguishing between various diseases and evaluating their prognosis, and demonstrate how radiomics advances this field. Finally, we offer our viewpoint on how the field can progress by addressing the challenges facing clinical implementation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The sense of the quality of life is an important variable, especially in the context of the profession; therefore it seems essential to capture the variables that predict this construct. The aim of the article was to show how self-esteem, emotional intelligence and social competences explain the sense of quality of life in a group of illusionists (N = 53). PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: The aim of the article was to show how self-esteem, emotional intelligence and social competences explain the sense of quality of life in a group of illusionists (N = 53). Moreover, the moderating role of the stage experience of relationships between predictors and the explained variable was checked. Polish tools were used in the study: the Popular Questionnaire of Emotional Intelligence, the Questionnaire of Social Competences and the Sense of Quality of Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the predictors that explained the sense of quality of life to the greatest extent (in the psychosocial, subjective and metaphysical spheres) were the acceptance of emotions and social competences. Stage experience turned out to be a moderator of the relation between emotional intelligence and the subjective sphere of the sense of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted research may constitute the basis for changing the approach to everyday functioning in order to improve the sense of quality of life.

Author: ['Xu X', 'Lu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zhou X', 'Ma R', 'Xiong H', 'Li M', 'Wu Q', 'Xu J']
Journal Title: Optics express
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: Tunable terahertz (THz) microcavities are crucial for the compact on-chip THz devices, aiming to future cloud-based computing, and artificial-intelligence technologies. However, the solutions to effectively modulate THz microcavities remain elusive. Strong coupling has been widely demonstrated in many configurations at different ambient conditions to date and may serve as a promising tool to modulate THz microcavities. Here, we schematically design a microcavity-plasmon hybrid system, and propose an effective approach to modulating the resonant frequencies of THz microcavities by the microcavity-resonator strong coupling. In this case, we observed the strongly coupling states, where the resultant two-polariton branches exhibit an anti-crossing splitting in the frequency domain, experimentally exhibiting a  approximately 6.2% frequency modulation to the microcavity compared to the uncoupled case. This work provides an efficient approach to modulating chip-scale THz microcavities, thereby facilitating the development and application of compact THz integrated devices, further empowering the evolution of future information processing and intelligent computing system.

Title: Spatial planning of urban communities via deep reinforcement learning.
Author: ['Zheng Y', 'Lin Y', 'Zhao L', 'Wu T', 'Jin D', 'Li Y']
Journal Title: Nature computational science
Publication Date: 2023 Sep
Abstract: Effective spatial planning of urban communities plays a critical role in the sustainable development of cities. Despite the convenience brought by geographic information systems and computer-aided design, determining the layout of land use and roads still heavily relies on human experts. Here we propose an artificial intelligence urban-planning model to generate spatial plans for urban communities. To overcome the difficulty of diverse and irregular urban geography, we construct a graph to describe the topology of cities in arbitrary forms and formulate urban planning as a sequential decision-making problem on the graph. To tackle the challenge of the vast solution space, we develop a reinforcement learning model based on graph neural networks. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world communities demonstrate that our computational model outperforms plans designed by human experts in objective metrics and that it can generate spatial plans responding to different circumstances and needs. We also propose a human-artificial intelligence collaborative workflow of urban planning, in which human designers can substantially benefit from our model to be more productive, generating more efficient spatial plans with much less time. Our method demonstrates the great potential of computational urban planning and paves the way for more explorations in leveraging computational methodologies to solve challenging real-world problems in urban science.

Journal Title: Food chemistry
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 31
Abstract: The key components dominating the quality of green tea and black tea are still unclear. Here, we respectively produced green and black teas in March and June, and investigated the correlations between sensory quality and chemical compositions of dry teas by multivariate statistics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence algorithm. The key chemical indices were screened out to establish tea sensory quality-prediction models based on the result of OPLS-DA and random forest, namely 4 flavonol glycosides of green tea and 8 indices of black tea (4 pigments, epigallocatechin, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside, ratios of caffeine/total catechins and epi/non-epi catechins). Compared with OPLS-DA and random forest, the support vector machine model had good sensory quality-prediction performance for both green tea and black tea (F1-score > 0.92), even based on the indices of fresh tea leaves. Our study explores the potential of artificial intelligence algorithm in classification and prediction of tea products with different sensory quality.

Title: [Artificial neural networks as a psychiatric instrument].
Author: ['Mertens L', 'Vennekens J', 'Op de Beeck H', 'Yargholi E', 'Van den Stock J']
Journal Title: Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved enormously over the past decade and is increasingly being applied to a range of domains, including psychiatry. AI encompasses several modalities, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), referring to computer models partly based on the workings of the brain. ANNs have existed since the &rsquo;50s, but only became &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; since the 2010s. The fact that they are inspired by the workings of the brain raises the question of whether they can also be used to model the (dys)functioning of the brain. This question led to the advent of the research field &lsquo;computational psychiatry&rsquo;. AIM: This article aims at providing an accessible introduction to artificial neural networks, and potential applications hereof in contemporary psychiatric practice. METHOD: Literature review with some examples. RESULTS: In this article we try to outline with some concrete examples what artificial neural networks are and how they can be used to model mechanisms in the brain. We successively discuss ANNs as a model of the human visual system, as a model of prosopagnosia and as a model of auditory hallucinations and finally as a model of autism spectrum disorder. We also describe a number of limitations of this approach. CONCLUSION: A computer model that models the entire brain is challenging at present, but current models can help in testing hypotheses concerning possible mechanisms that give rise to a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions.

Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence which suggests the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnostic assessment and pre-treatment evaluation of thyroid eye disease (TED). This scoping review aims to (1) identify the extent of the available evidence (2) provide an in-depth analysis of AI research methodology of the studies included in the review (3) Identify knowledge gaps pertaining to research in this area. METHODS: This review was performed according to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). We quantify the diagnostic accuracy of AI models in the field of TED assessment and appraise the quality of these studies using the modified QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were included in this review. The most common AI models used in these studies are convolutional neural networks (CNN). The majority of the studies compared algorithm performance against healthcare professionals. The overall risk of bias and applicability using the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool led to most of the studies being classified as low risk, although higher deficiency was noted in the risk of bias in flow and timing. CONCLUSIONS: While the results of the review showed high diagnostic accuracy of the AI models in identifying features of TED relevant to disease assessment, deficiencies in study design causing study bias and compromising study applicability were noted. Moving forward, limitations and challenges inherent to machine learning should be addressed with improved standardized guidance around study design, reporting, and legislative framework.

Title: Liver volumetric and anatomic assessment in living donor liver transplantation: The role of modern imaging and artificial intelligence.
Author: ['Machry M', 'Ferreira LF', 'Lucchese AM', 'Kalil AN', 'Feier FH']
Journal Title: World journal of transplantation
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: The shortage of deceased donor organs has prompted the development of alternative liver grafts for transplantation. Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a viable option, expanding the donor pool and enabling timely transplantation with favorable graft function and improved long-term outcomes. An accurate evaluation of the donor liver's volumetry (LV) and anatomical study is crucial to ensure adequate future liver remnant, graft volume and precise liver resection. Thus, ensuring donor safety and an appropriate graft-to-recipient weight ratio. Manual LV (MLV) using computed tomography has traditionally been considered the gold standard for assessing liver volume. However, the method has been limited by cost, subjectivity, and variability. Automated LV techniques employing advanced segmentation algorithms offer improved reproducibility, reduced variability, and enhanced efficiency compared to manual measurements. However, the accuracy of automated LV requires further investigation. The study provides a comprehensive review of traditional and emerging LV methods, including semi-automated image processing, automated LV techniques, and machine learning-based approaches. Additionally, the study discusses the respective strengths and weaknesses of each of the aforementioned techniques. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, is expected to become a routine part of surgical planning in the near future. The implementation of AI is expected to enable faster and more accurate image study interpretations, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance the safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of the procedures. Accurate preoperative assessment of the liver plays a crucial role in ensuring safe donor selection and improved outcomes in LDLT. MLV has inherent limitations that have led to the adoption of semi-automated and automated software solutions. Moreover, AI has tremendous potential for LV and segmentation; however, its widespread use is hindered by cost and availability. Therefore, the integration of multiple specialties is necessary to embrace technology and explore its possibilities, ranging from patient counseling to intraoperative decision-making through automation and AI.

Journal Title: Imaging science in dentistry
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: PURPOSE: The objective of this scoping review was to investigate the applicability and performance of various convolutional neural network (CNN) models in tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs, achieved through classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online search was performed of the PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Based on the selection process, 12 studies were included in this review. RESULTS: Eleven studies utilized a CNN model for detection tasks, 5 for classification tasks, and 3 for segmentation tasks in the context of tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Most of these studies revealed high performance of various CNN models in automating tooth numbering. However, several studies also highlighted limitations of CNNs, such as the presence of false positives and false negatives in identifying decayed teeth, teeth with crown prosthetics, teeth adjacent to edentulous areas, dental implants, root remnants, wisdom teeth, and root canal-treated teeth. These limitations can be overcome by ensuring both the quality and quantity of datasets, as well as optimizing the CNN architecture. CONCLUSION: CNNs have demonstrated high performance in automated tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Future development of CNN-based models for this purpose should also consider different stages of dentition, such as the primary and mixed dentition stages, as well as the presence of various tooth conditions. Ultimately, an optimized CNN architecture can serve as the foundation for an automated tooth numbering system and for further artificial intelligence research on panoramic radiographs for a variety of purposes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: At the forefront of machine learning research since its inception has been natural language processing, also known as text mining, referring to a wide range of statistical processes for analyzing textual data and retrieving information. In medical fields, text mining has made valuable contributions in unexpected ways, not least by synthesizing data from disparate biomedical studies. This rapid scoping review examines how machine learning methods for text mining can be implemented at the intersection of these disparate fields to improve the workflow and process of conducting systematic reviews in medical research and related academic disciplines. METHODS: The primary research question that this investigation asked, "what impact does the use of machine learning have on the methods used by systematic review teams to carry out the systematic review process, such as the precision of search strategies, unbiased article selection or data abstraction and/or analysis for systematic reviews and other comprehensive review types of similar methodology?" A literature search was conducted by a medical librarian utilizing multiple databases, a grey literature search and handsearching of the literature. The search was completed on December 4, 2020. Handsearching was done on an ongoing basis with an end date of April 14, 2023. RESULTS: The search yielded 23,190 studies after duplicates were removed. As a result, 117 studies (1.70%) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this rapid scoping review. CONCLUSIONS: There are several techniques and/or types of machine learning methods in development or that have already been fully developed to assist with the systematic review stages. Combined with human intelligence, these machine learning methods and tools provide promise for making the systematic review process more efficient, saving valuable time for systematic review authors, and increasing the speed in which evidence can be created and placed in the hands of decision makers and the public.
