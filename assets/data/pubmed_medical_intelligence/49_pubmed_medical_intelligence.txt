Author: ['Wang Y', 'Yu Y', 'Liu Y', 'Ma Y', 'Pang PC']
Journal Title: JMIR mental health
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 5
Abstract: BACKGROUND: After the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between limited mental health care resources and the rapidly growing number of patients has become more pronounced. It is necessary for psychologists to borrow artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to analyze patients' satisfaction with drug treatment for those undergoing mental illness treatment. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to construct highly accurate and transferable models for predicting the satisfaction of patients with mental illness with medication by analyzing their own experiences and comments related to medication intake. METHODS: We extracted 41,851 reviews in 20 categories of disorders related to mental illnesses from a large public data set of 161,297 reviews in 16,950 illness categories. To discover a more optimal structure of the natural language processing models, we proposed the Unified Interchangeable Model Fusion to decompose the state-of-the-art Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine, and random forest (RF) models into 2 modules, the encoder and the classifier, and then reconstruct fused "encoder+classifer" models to accurately evaluate patients' satisfaction. The fused models were divided into 2 categories in terms of model structures, traditional machine learning-based models and neural network-based models. A new loss function was proposed for those neural network-based models to overcome overfitting and data imbalance. Finally, we fine-tuned the fused models and evaluated their performance comprehensively in terms of F(1)-score, accuracy, kappa coefficient, and training time using 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Through extensive experiments, the transformer bidirectional encoder+RF model outperformed the state-of-the-art BERT, MentalBERT, and other fused models. It became the optimal model for predicting the patients' satisfaction with drug treatment. It achieved an average graded F(1)-score of 0.872, an accuracy of 0.873, and a kappa coefficient of 0.806. This model is suitable for high-standard users with sufficient computing resources. Alternatively, it turned out that the word-embedding encoder+RF model showed relatively good performance with an average graded F(1)-score of 0.801, an accuracy of 0.812, and a kappa coefficient of 0.695 but with much less training time. It can be deployed in environments with limited computing resources. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed the performance of support vector machine, RF, BERT, MentalBERT, and all fused models and identified the optimal models for different clinical scenarios. The findings can serve as evidence to support that the natural language processing methods can effectively assist psychologists in evaluating the satisfaction of patients with drug treatment programs and provide precise and standardized solutions. The Unified Interchangeable Model Fusion provides a different perspective on building AI models in mental health and has the potential to fuse the strengths of different components of the models into a single model, which may contribute to the development of AI in mental health.

Title: How Can the Clinical Aptitude of AI Assistants Be Assayed?
Author: ['Thirunavukarasu AJ']
Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 5
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are exhibiting remarkable performance in clinical contexts, with exemplar results ranging from expert-level attainment in medical examination questions to superior accuracy and relevance when responding to patient queries compared to real doctors replying to queries on social media. The deployment of LLMs in conventional health care settings is yet to be reported, and there remains an open question as to what evidence should be required before such deployment is warranted. Early validation studies use unvalidated surrogate variables to represent clinical aptitude, and it may be necessary to conduct prospective randomized controlled trials to justify the use of an LLM for clinical advice or assistance, as potential pitfalls and pain points cannot be exhaustively predicted. This viewpoint states that as LLMs continue to revolutionize the field, there is an opportunity to improve the rigor of artificial intelligence (AI) research to reward innovation, conferring real benefits to real patients.

Author: ['Khavandi S', 'Zaghloul F', 'Higham A', 'Lim E', 'de Pennington N', 'Celi LA']
Journal Title: JMIR research protocols
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 5
Abstract: BACKGROUND: While digital health innovations are increasingly being adopted by health care organizations, implementation is often carried out without considering the impacts on frontline staff who will be using the technology and who will be affected by its introduction. The enthusiasm surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital solutions in health care is tempered by uncertainty around how it will change the working lives and practices of health care professionals. Digital enablement can be viewed as facilitating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency by improving services and automating cognitive labor, yet the implementation of such AI technology comes with challenges related to changes in work practices brought by automation. This research explores staff experiences before and after care pathway automation with an autonomous clinical conversational assistant, Dora (Ufonia Ltd), that is able to automate routine clinical conversations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to examine the impact of AI-enabled automation on clinicians, allied health professionals, and administrators who provide or facilitate health care to patients in high-volume, low-complexity care pathways. In the process of transforming care pathways through automation of routine tasks, staff will increasingly "work at the top of their license." The impact of this fundamental change on the professional identity, well-being, and work practices of the individual is poorly understood at present. METHODS: We will adopt a multiple case study approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, over 2 distinct phases, namely phase A (preimplementation) and phase B (postimplementation). RESULTS: The analysis is expected to reveal the interrelationship between Dora and those affected by its introduction. This will reveal how tasks and responsibilities have changed or shifted, current tensions and contradictions, ways of working, and challenges, benefits, and opportunities as perceived by those on the frontlines of the health care system. The findings will enable a better understanding of the resistance or susceptibility of different stakeholders within the health care workforce and encourage managerial awareness of differing needs, demands, and uncertainties. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of AI in the health care sector, as well as the body of research on this topic, remain in their infancy. The project's key contribution will be to understand the impact of AI-enabled automation on the health care workforce and their work practices.

Title: What should we expect when colon wall thickening is detected on abdominal CT scan in the era of artificial intelligence?
Author: ['Gur HU', 'Koyuncu A']
Journal Title: Annali italiani di chirurgia
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: AIM: Except for emergencies, endoscopic findings were investigated in patients with increased thickness of the colon wall on abdominal CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients who underwent colonoscopy due to the detection of thickening of the colon wall in the abdominal CT performed for non-emergency reasons in the General Surgery Clinic of Health Sciences University Haseki Training and Research Hospital between January 2018 and December 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Data were obtained by scanning the hospital database. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients who underwent colonoscopy after incidentally detected increased colonic wall thickening determined from the hospital database. Endoscopic examinations revealed tumors in 30 patients (55.6%), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 9 patients (16,6%), nonspesific colitis in 1 patient (1,9%), polyps in 3 patients (5,6%), and diverticula in 2 patients (3.7%). No pathology was detected in 9 patients (16.6%). Patients were aged between 21 and 87 (mean 59,04 years, SD +/- 18,54). DISCUSSION: Tumor is the primary endoscopy finding in cases where an increase in colon wall thickness is detected incidentally on abdominal CT, except in emergencies. We performed this preliminary study in the near future to determine the diagnostic algorithm with the use of artificial intelligence in radiology and thus avoid unnecessary investigations. CONCLUSION: In our study, the main reason for the incidentally detected increase in colon wall thickness is the tumor. A diagnostic algorithm can be created with machine learning, a subcomponent of artificial intelligence. KEY WORDS: Artificial intelligence, Bowel wall thickening, Colonoscopy, Computed tomography.

Journal Title: Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 5
Abstract: The technical synergy between flexible sensing paper and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) in the next stage of artificial intelligence Internet of Things engineering makes the development of intelligent sensing paper with triboelectric function very attractive. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to explore functional papers that are more suitable for triboelectric sensing. Here, a cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) reinforced PVDF hybrid paper (CPHP) is developed by electrospinning technology. Benefitting from the unique effects of CNCs, CPHP forms a solid cross-linked network among fibers and obtains a high-strength (25 MPa) paper-like state and high surface roughness. Meanwhile, CNCs also improve the triboelectrification effect of CPHP by assisting the PVDF matrix to form more electroactive phases (96% share) and a higher relative permittivity (17.9). The CPHP-based TENG with single electrode configuration demonstrates good output performance (open-circuit voltage of 116 V, short-circuit current of 2.2 microA and power density of 91 mW m(-2) ) and ultrahigh pressure-sensitivity response (3.95 mV Pa(-1) ), which endows CPHP with reliable power supply and sensing capability. More importantly, the CPHP-based flexible self-powered tactile sensor with TENG array exhibits multifunctional applications in imitation Morse code compilation, tactile track recognition, and game character control, showing great prospects in the intelligent inductive device and human-machine interaction.

Title: A Discussion of the Contemporary Prediction Models for Atrial Fibrillation.
Author: ['Rosenberg MA', 'Adewumi J', 'Aleong RG']
Journal Title: Medical research archives
Publication Date: 2023 Oct
Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation is a complex disease state with many environmental and genetic risk factors. While there are environmental factors that have been shown to increase an individual's risk of atrial fibrillation, it has become clear that atrial fibrillation has a genetic component that influences why some patients are at a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared to others. This review will first discuss the clinical diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and the corresponding rhythm atrial flutter. We will then discuss how a patients' risk of stroke can be assessed by using other clinical co-morbidities. We will then review the clinical risk factors that can be used to help predict an individual patient's risk of atrial fibrillation. Many of the clinical risk factors have been used to create several different risk scoring methods that will be reviewed. We will then discuss how genetics can be used to identify individuals who are at higher risk for developing atrial fibrillation. We will discuss genome-wide association studies and other sequencing high-throughput sequencing studies. Finally, we will touch on how genetic variants derived from a genome-wide association studies can be used to calculate an individual's polygenic risk score for atrial fibrillation. An atrial fibrillation polygenic risk score can be used to identify patients at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation and may allow for a reduction in some of the complications associated with atrial fibrillation such as cerebrovascular accidents and the development of heart failure. Finally, there is a brief discussion of how artificial intelligence models can be used to predict which patients will develop atrial fibrillation.

Title: ChatGPT's Potential in Enhancing Physician Efficiency: A Japanese Case Study.
Author: ['Kaneda Y', 'Takita M', 'Hamaki T', 'Ozaki A', 'Tanimoto T']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI (San Francisco, CA, USA), is making significant strides in the medical field. In a simulated case study, a 66-year-old Japanese female patient's dialogue with a physician was transcribed and inputted into ChatGPT to assess its efficacy in drafting medical records, formulating differential diagnoses, and establishing treatment plans. The results showed a high similarity between the medical summaries generated by ChatGPT and those of the attending physician. This suggests that ChatGPT has the potential to assist physicians in clinical reasoning and reduce the administrative burden, allowing them to spend more time with patients. However, there are limitations, such as the system's reliance on linguistic data and occasional inaccuracies. Despite its potential, the ethical implications of using patient data and the risk of AI replacing clinicians emphasize the need for continuous evaluation, rigorous oversight, and the establishment of comprehensive guidelines. As AI continues to integrate into healthcare, it is crucial for physicians to ensure that technology complements, rather than replaces, human expertise, with the primary focus remaining on delivering high-quality patient care.

Author: ['Johns E', 'Alkanj A', 'Beck M', 'Dal Mas L', 'Gourieux B', 'Sauleau EA', 'Michel B']
Journal Title: European journal of hospital pharmacy : science and practice
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 24
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) is catching the interest of hospital pharmacists. A massive collection of health data is now available to train AI models and hold the promise of disrupting codes and practices. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the state of the art of machine learning or deep learning models that detect inappropriate hospital medication orders. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from inception to May 2023. Studies were included if they reported and described an AI model intended for use by clinical pharmacists in hospitals. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). RESULTS: 13 articles were selected after review: 12 studies were judged to have high risk of bias; 11 studies were published between 2020 and 2023; 8 were conducted in North America and Asia; 6 analysed orders and detected inappropriate prescriptions according to patient profiles and medication orders; and 7 detected specific inappropriate prescriptions, such as detecting antibiotic resistance, dosage abnormality in prescriptions, high alert drugs errors from prescriptions or predicting the risk of adverse drug events. Various AI models were used, mainly supervised learning techniques. The training datasets used were very heterogeneous; the length of study varied from 2 weeks to 7 years and the number of prescription orders analysed went from 31 to 5 804 192. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review points out that, to date, few original research studies report AI tools based on machine or deep learning in the field of hospital clinical pharmacy. However, these original articles, while preliminary, highlighted the potential value of integrating AI into clinical hospital pharmacy practice.

Abstract: Advances in materials science and memory devices work in tandem for the evolution of Artificial Intelligence systems. Energy-efficient computation is the ultimate goal of emerging memristor technology, in which the storage and computation can be done in the same memory crossbar. In this work, an analog memristor device is fabricated utilizing the unique characteristics of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to act as the switching medium of the device. Via the planar structure, the memristor device exhibits analog switching ability with high state stability. The device's conductance and capacitance can be tuned simultaneously, increasing the device's potential and broadening its applications' horizons. The multi-state storage capability and long-term memory are the key factors that make the device a promising candidate for bio-inspired computing applications. As a demonstrator, the fabricated memristor is deployed in spiking neural networks (SNN) to exploit its analog switching feature for energy-efficient classification operation. Results reveal that the computation-in-memory implementation performs Vector Matrix Multiplication with 95% inference accuracy and few femtojoules per spike energy efficiency. The memristor device presented in this work opens new insights towards utilizing the outstanding features of SWCNTs for efficient analog computation in deep learning systems.

Author: ['Cox RL', 'Hunt KL', 'Hill RR']
Journal Title: The Journal of nursing education
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize nursing education. This study compared NCLEX-RN questions generated by AI and those created by nurse educators. METHOD: Faculty of accredited baccalaureate programs were invited to participate. Likert-scale items for grammar and clarity of the item stem and distractors were compared using Mann-Whitney U, and yes/no questions about clinical relevance and complex terminology were analyzed using chi-square. A one-sample binomial test with confidence intervals evaluated participants' question preference (AI-generated or educator-written). Qualitative responses identified themes across faculty. RESULTS: Item clarity, grammar, and difficulty were similar for AI and educator-created questions. Clinical relevance and use of complex terminology was similar for all question pairs. Of the four sets with preference for one item, three were generated by AI. CONCLUSION: AI can assist faculty with item generation to prepare nursing students for the NCLEX-RN examination. Faculty expertise is necessary to refine questions written using both methods. [J Nurs Educ. 2023;62(12):679-687.].

Author: ['Roosan D', 'Padua P', 'Khan R', 'Khan H', 'Verzosa C', 'Wu Y']
Journal Title: Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 2
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize medication therapy management (MTM) in identifying drug interactions may potentially improve MTM efficiency. ChatGPT, an AI language model, may be applied to identify medication interventions by integrating patient and drug databases. ChatGPT has been shown to be effective in other areas of clinical medicine, from diagnosis to patient management. However, ChatGPT's ability to manage MTM related activities is little known. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT in MTM services in simple, complex, and very complex cases to understand AI contributions in MTM. METHODS: Two clinical pharmacists rated and validated the difficulty of patient cases from simple, complex, and very complex. ChatGPT's response to the cases was assessed based on 3 criteria: the ability to identify drug interactions, precision in recommending alternatives, and appropriateness in devising management plans. Two clinical pharmacists validated the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses and compared them to actual answers for each complexity level. RESULTS: ChatGPT 4.0 accurately solved 39 out of 39 (100 %) patient cases. ChatGPT successfully identified drug interactions, provided therapy recommendations and formulated general management plans, but it did not recommend specific dosages. Results suggest it can assist pharmacists in formulating MTM plans to improve overall efficiency. CONCLUSION: The application of ChatGPT in MTM has the potential to enhance patient safety and involvement, lower healthcare costs, and assist healthcare providers in medication management and identifying drug interactions. Future pharmacists can utilize AI models such as ChatGPT to improve patient care. The future of the pharmacy profession will depend on how the field responds to the changing need for patient care optimized by AI and automation.

Title: The Influence of the Novel Computer-Aided Triage System Based on Artificial Intelligence on Endovascular Therapy in Patients with Large Vascular Occlusions: A Meta-Analysis.
Author: ['Luo W', 'Xu Y', 'Liu C', 'Zhang H']
Journal Title: World neurosurgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 3
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with modern healthcare has become increasingly prominent. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the novel computer-aided triage system based on artificial intelligence (AI-CTS) on endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with large vascular occlusions (LVO). This study marks the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on the subject. METHODS: A comprehensive study was performed on PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases from their establishment to September 2023, in accordance with PRISMA recommendations. RevMan 5.4 software was used for summative analysis. The outcomes included door-to-groin (DTG) time, time from CT scan initiation to EVT, time from CT scan to reperfusion, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: A total of 7 studies involving 752 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that patients in the post-AI group had less time of DTG [SMD, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40-0.69; P < 0.00001] and CT scan to EVT [SMD, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.73; P < 0.00001], as well as less time of CTA to recanalization [SMD, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90; P < 0.00001]. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of the mRS at 90 days [OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.43-1.01; P = 0.06]. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of AI-CTS and EVT has improved the therapy process for LVO patients. However, the improvement in mRS at 90 days was not significant; further research is warranted.

Author: ['Choi HS', 'Kim JS', 'Whangbo TK', 'Eun SJ']
Journal Title: International neurourology journal
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: PURPOSE: Urinary stones cause lateral abdominal pain and are a prevalent condition among younger age groups. The diagnosis typically involves assessing symptoms, conducting physical examinations, performing urine tests, and utilizing radiological imaging. Artificial intelligence models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in detecting stones. However, due to insufficient datasets, the performance of these models has not reached a level suitable for practical application. Consequently, this study introduces a vision transformer (ViT)-based pipeline for detecting urinary stones, using computed tomography images with augmentation. METHODS: The super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) model was employed to enhance the resolution of a given dataset, followed by data augmentation using CycleGAN. Subsequently, the ViT model facilitated the detection and classification of urinary tract stones. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall as metrics. RESULTS: The deep learning model based on ViT showed superior performance compared to other existing models. Furthermore, the performance increased with the size of the backbone model. CONCLUSION: The study proposes a way to utilize medical data to improve the diagnosis of urinary tract stones. SRCNN was used for data preprocessing to enhance resolution, while CycleGAN was utilized for data augmentation. The ViT model was utilized for stone detection, and its performance was validated through metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the F1 score. It is anticipated that this research will aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract stones, thereby improving the efficiency of medical personnel.
