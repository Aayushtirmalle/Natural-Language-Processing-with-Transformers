Journal Title: Frontiers in pediatrics
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In the field of pediatric trauma computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems have emerged offering a promising avenue for improved patient care. Especially children with wrist fractures may benefit from machine learning (ML) solutions, since some of these lesions may be overlooked on conventional X-ray due to minimal compression without dislocation or mistaken for cartilaginous growth plates. In this article, we describe the development and optimization of AI algorithms for wrist fracture detection in children. METHODS: A team of IT-specialists, pediatric radiologists and pediatric surgeons used the freely available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset containing annotated pediatric trauma wrist radiographs of 6,091 patients, a total number of 10,643 studies (20,327 images). First, a basic object detection model, a You Only Look Once object detector of the seventh generation (YOLOv7) was trained and tested on these data. Then, team decisions were taken to adjust data preparation, image sizes used for training and testing, and configuration of the detection model. Furthermore, we investigated each of these models using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method called Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). This method visualizes where a model directs its attention to before classifying and regressing a certain class through saliency maps. RESULTS: Mean average precision (mAP) improved when applying optimizations pre-processing the dataset images (maximum increases of + 25.51% mAP@0.5 and + 39.78% mAP@[0.5:0.95]), as well as the object detection model itself (maximum increases of + 13.36% mAP@0.5 and + 27.01% mAP@[0.5:0.95]). Generally, when analyzing the resulting models using XAI methods, higher scoring model variations in terms of mAP paid more attention to broader regions of the image, prioritizing detection accuracy over precision compared to the less accurate models. DISCUSSION: This paper supports the implementation of ML solutions for pediatric trauma care. Optimization of a large X-ray dataset and the YOLOv7 model improve the model's ability to detect objects and provide valid diagnostic support to health care specialists. Such optimization protocols must be understood and advocated, before comparing ML performances against health care specialists.

Journal Title: Frontiers in nutrition
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Children, adolescents, and young adult cancer survivors (CAYAs) constitute a growing population requiring a customized approach to mitigate the incidence of severe complications throughout their lifetimes. During cancer treatment, CAYAs cancer survivors undergo significant disruptions in their nutritional status, elevating the risks of mortality, morbidity, and cardiovascular events. The assessment of nutritional status during cancer treatment involves anthropometric and dietary evaluations, emphasizing the necessity for regular assessments and the timely identification of risk factors. Proactive nutritional interventions, addressing both undernutrition and overnutrition, should be tailored to specific age groups and incorporate a family-centered approach. Despite encouraging interventions, a notable evidence gap persists. The goal of this review is to comprehensively examine the existing evidence on potential nutritional interventions for CAYAs cancer survivors. We explore the evidence so far collected on the nutritional intervention strategies elaborated for CAYAs cancer survivors that should target both undernutrition and overnutrition, being age-specific and involving a family-based approach. Furthermore, we suggest harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to anticipate and prevent malnutrition in CAYAs cancer survivors, contributing to the identification of novel risk factors and promoting proactive, personalized healthcare.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 300 million people globally. Despite its high prevalence and debilitating effects, only one-third of patients newly diagnosed with depression initiate treatment. Electronic cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) is an effective treatment for depression and is a feasible solution to make mental health care more accessible. Due to its online format, e-CBT can be combined with variable therapist engagement to address different care needs. Typically, a multi-professional care team determines which combination therapy most benefits the patient. However, this process can add to the costs of these programs. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed to offset these costs. METHODS: This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial recruiting individuals experiencing depression. The degree of care intensity a participant will receive will be randomly decided by either: (1) a machine learning algorithm, or (2) an assessment made by a group of healthcare professionals. Subsequently, participants will receive depression-specific e-CBT treatment through the secure online platform. There will be three available intensities of therapist interaction: (1) e-CBT; (2) e-CBT with a 15-20-min phone/video call; and (3) e-CBT with pharmacotherapy. This approach aims to accurately allocate care tailored to each patient's needs, allowing for more efficient use of resources. DISCUSSION: Artificial intelligence and providing patients with varying intensities of care can increase the efficiency of mental health care services. This study aims to determine a cost-effective method to decrease depressive symptoms and increase treatment adherence to online psychotherapy by allocating the correct intensity of therapist care for individuals diagnosed with depression. This will be done by comparing a decision-making machine learning algorithm to a multi-professional care team. This approach aims to accurately allocate care tailored to each patient's needs, allowing for more efficient use of resources with the convergence of technologies and healthcare. ETHICS: The study received ethics approval and began participant recruitment in December 2022. Participant recruitment has been conducted through targeted advertisements and physician referrals. Complete data collection and analysis are expected to conclude by August 2024. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.Gov, identifier NCT04747873.

Title: Realizing asynchronous finite-time robust tracking control of switched flight vehicles by using nonfragile deep reinforcement learning.
Author: ['Cheng H', 'Song R', 'Li H', 'Wei W', 'Zheng B', 'Fang Y']
Journal Title: Frontiers in neuroscience
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: In this study, a novel nonfragile deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method was proposed to realize the finite-time control of switched unmanned flight vehicles. Control accuracy, robustness, and intelligence were enhanced in the proposed control scheme by combining conventional robust control and DRL characteristics. In the proposed control strategy, the tracking controller consists of a dynamics-based controller and a learning-based controller. The conventional robust control approach for the nominal system was used for realizing a dynamics-based baseline tracking controller. The learning-based controller based on DRL was developed to compensate model uncertainties and enhance transient control accuracy. The multiple Lyapunov function approach and mode-dependent average dwell time approach were combined to analyze the finite-time stability of flight vehicles with asynchronous switching. The linear matrix inequalities technique was used to determine the solutions of dynamics-based controllers. Online optimization was formulated as a Markov decision process. The adaptive deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm was adopted to improve efficiency and convergence. In this algorithm, the actor-critic structure was used and adaptive hyperparameters were introduced. Unlike the conventional DRL algorithm, nonfragile control theory and adaptive reward function were used in the proposed algorithm to achieve excellent stability and training efficiency. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented algorithm through comparative simulations.

Title: Impact of SNR, peripheral auditory sensitivity, and central cognitive profile on the psychometric relation between pupillary response and speech performance in CI users.

Journal Title: Frontiers in neuroscience
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Despite substantial technical advances and wider clinical use, cochlear implant (CI) users continue to report high and elevated listening effort especially under challenging noisy conditions. Among all the objective measures to quantify listening effort, pupillometry is one of the most widely used and robust physiological measures. Previous studies with normally hearing (NH) and hearing-impaired (HI) listeners have shown that the relation between speech performance in noise and listening effort (as measured by peak pupil dilation) is not linear and exhibits an inverted-U shape. However, it is unclear whether the same psychometric relation exists in CI users, and whether individual differences in auditory sensitivity and central cognitive capacity affect this relation. Therefore, we recruited 17 post-lingually deaf CI adults to perform speech-in-noise tasks from 0 to 20 dB SNR with a 4 dB step size. Simultaneously, their pupillary responses and self-reported subjective effort were recorded. To characterize top-down and bottom-up individual variabilities, a spectro-temporal modulation task and a set of cognitive abilities were measured. Clinical word recognition in quiet and Quality of Life (QoL) were also collected. Results showed that at a group level, an inverted-U shape psychometric curve between task difficulty (SNR) and peak pupil dilation (PPD) was not observed. Individual shape of the psychometric curve was significantly associated with some individual factors: CI users with higher clinical word and speech-in-noise recognition showed a quadratic decrease of PPD over increasing SNRs; CI users with better non-verbal intelligence and lower QoL showed smaller average PPD. To summarize, individual differences in CI users had a significant impact on the psychometric relation between pupillary response and task difficulty, hence affecting the interpretation of pupillary response as listening effort (or engagement) at different task difficulty levels. Future research and clinical applications should further characterize the possible effects of individual factors (such as motivation or engagement) in modulating CI users' occurrence of 'tipping point' on their psychometric functions, and develop an individualized method for reliably quantifying listening effort using pupillometry.

Title: DrugHIVE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder for the Structure-Based Design of Drug-Like Molecules.
Author: ['Weller JA', 'Rohs R']
Journal Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 23
Abstract: Rapid advancement in the computational methods of structure-based drug design has led to their widespread adoption as key tools in the early drug development process. Recently, the remarkable growth of available crystal structure data and libraries of commercially available or readily synthesizable molecules have unlocked previously inaccessible regions of chemical space for drug development. Paired with improvements in virtual ligand screening methods, these expanded libraries are having a significant impact on the success of early drug design efforts. However, screening-based approaches are limited in their scalability due to computational limits and the sheer scale of drug-like space. A method within the quickly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), deep generative modeling, is extending the reach of molecular design beyond classical methods by learning the fundamental intra- and inter-molecular relationships in drug-target systems from existing data. In this work we introduce DrugHIVE, a deep structure-based generative model that enables fine-grained control over molecular generation. We demonstrate DrugHIVE's capacity to accelerate a wide range of common drug design tasks such as de novo generation, molecular optimization, scaffold hopping, linker design, and high throughput pattern replacement. Our method is highly scalable and can be applied to high confidence AlphaFold predicted receptors, extending our ability to generate high quality drug-like molecules to a majority of the unsolved human proteome.

Title: On the necessity to include multiple types of evidence when predicting molecular function of proteins.
Author: ['de Crecy-Lagard V', 'Swairjo MA']
Journal Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Machine learning-based platforms are currently revolutionizing many fields of molecular biology including structure prediction for monomers or complexes, predicting the consequences of mutations, or predicting the functions of proteins. However, these platforms use training sets based on currently available knowledge and, in essence, are not built to discover novelty. Hence, claims of discovering novel functions for protein families using artificial intelligence should be carefully dissected, as the dangers of overpredictions are real as we show in a detailed analysis of the prediction made by Kim et al (1) on the function of the YciO protein in the model organism Escherichia coli .

Title: The relationship between student interaction with generative artificial intelligence and learning achievement: serial mediating roles of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement.
Author: ['Liang J', 'Wang L', 'Luo J', 'Yan Y', 'Fan C']
Journal Title: Frontiers in psychology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shocked the world with its unprecedented ability and raised significant tensions in the education field. Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI rather than shuns it. Understanding the mechanism between students interacting with GAI tools and their achievement is important for educators and schools, but relevant empirical evidence is relatively lacking. Due to the characteristics of personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the students-GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: (1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student-GAI interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the student-GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the results. The findings offer empirical evidence for the incorporation of GAI in teaching and learning.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE), which has increased in prevalence worldwide, is a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although there is a gap in the detection rates between endoscopic BE and histological BE in current research, we trained our artificial intelligence (AI) system with images of endoscopic BE and tested the system with images of histological BE. AIM: To assess whether an AI system can aid in the detection of BE in our setting. METHODS: Endoscopic narrow-band imaging (NBI) was collected from Chung Shan Medical University Hospital and Changhua Christian Hospital, resulting in 724 cases, with 86 patients having pathological results. Three senior endoscopists, who were instructing physicians of the Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan, independently annotated the images in the development set to determine whether each image was classified as an endoscopic BE. The test set consisted of 160 endoscopic images of 86 cases with histological results. RESULTS: Six pre-trained models were compared, and EfficientNetV2B2 (accuracy [ACC]: 0.8) was selected as the backbone architecture for further evaluation due to better ACC results. In the final test, the AI system correctly identified 66 of 70 cases of BE and 85 of 90 cases without BE, resulting in an ACC of 94.37%. CONCLUSION: Our AI system, which was trained by NBI of endoscopic BE, can adequately predict endoscopic images of histological BE. The ACC, sensitivity, and specificity are 94.37%, 94.29%, and 94.44%, respectively.

Title: Challenges involved in the application of artificial intelligence in gastroenterology: The race is on!
Author: ['Christou CD', 'Tsoulfas G']
Journal Title: World journal of gastroenterology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: Gastroenterology is a particularly data-rich field, generating vast repositories of data that are a fruitful ground for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. In this opinion review, we initially elaborate on the current status of the application of AI/ML-based software in gastroenterology. Currently, AI/ML-based models have been developed in the following applications: Models integrated into the clinical setting following real-time patient data flagging patients at high risk for developing a gastrointestinal disease, models employing non-invasive parameters that provide accurate diagnoses aiming to either replace, minimize, or refine the indications of endoscopy, models utilizing genomic data to diagnose various gastrointestinal diseases, computer-aided diagnosis systems facilitating the interpretation of endoscopy images, models to facilitate treatment allocation and predict the response to treatment, and finally, models in prognosis predicting complications, recurrence following treatment, and overall survival. Then, we elaborate on several challenges and how they may negatively impact the widespread application of AI in healthcare and gastroenterology. Specifically, we elaborate on concerns regarding accuracy, cost-effectiveness, cybersecurity, interpretability, oversight, and liability. While AI is unlikely to replace physicians, it will transform the skillset demanded by future physicians to practice. Thus, physicians are expected to engage with AI to avoid becoming obsolete.

Title: Identification of oral therapeutics using an AI platform against the virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2.
Author: ['Bess A', 'Berglind F', 'Mukhopadhyay S', 'Brylinski M', 'Alvin C', 'Fattah F', 'Wasan KM']
Journal Title: Frontiers in pharmacology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Purpose: This study introduces a sophisticated computational pipeline, eVir, designed for the discovery of antiviral drugs based on their interactions within the human protein network. There is a pressing need for cost-effective therapeutics for infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), particularly in resource-limited countries. Therefore, our team devised an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to explore repurposing opportunities for currently used oral therapies. The eVir system operates by identifying pharmaceutical compounds that mirror the effects of antiviral peptides (AVPs)-fragments of human proteins known to interfere with fundamental phases of the viral life cycle: entry, fusion, and replication. eVir extrapolates the probable antiviral efficacy of a given compound by analyzing its established and predicted impacts on the human protein-protein interaction network. This innovative approach provides a promising platform for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 or any virus for which peptide data is available. Methods: The eVir AI software pipeline processes drug-protein and protein-protein interaction networks generated from open-source datasets. eVir uses Node2Vec, a graph embedding technique, to understand the nuanced connections among drugs and proteins. The embeddings are input a Siamese Network (SNet) and MLPs, each tailored for the specific mechanisms of entry, fusion, and replication, to evaluate the similarity between drugs and AVPs. Scores generated from the SNet and MLPs undergo a Platt probability calibration and are combined into a unified score that gauges the potential antiviral efficacy of a drug. This integrated approach seeks to boost drug identification confidence, offering a potential solution for detecting therapeutic candidates with pronounced antiviral potency. Once identified a number of compounds were tested for efficacy and toxicity in lung carcinoma cells (Calu-3) infected with SARS-CoV-2. A lead compound was further identified to determine its efficacy and toxicity in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Computational Predictions: The SNet confidently differentiated between similar and dissimilar drug pairs with an accuracy of 97.28% and AUC of 99.47%. Key compounds identified through these networks included Zinc, Mebendazole, Levomenol, Gefitinib, Niclosamide, and Imatinib. Notably, Mebendazole and Zinc showcased the highest similarity scores, while Imatinib, Levemenol, and Gefitinib also ranked within the top 20, suggesting their significant pharmacological potentials. Further examination of protein binding analysis using explainable AI focused on reverse engineering the causality of the networks. Protein interaction scores for Mebendazole and Imatinib revealed their effects on notable proteins such as CDPK1, VEGF2, ABL1, and several tyrosine protein kinases. Laboratory Studies: This study determined that Mebendazole, Gefitinib, Topotecan and to some extent Carfilzomib showed conventional drug-response curves, with IC50 values near or below that of Remdesivir with excellent confidence all above R2>0.91, and no cytotoxicity at the IC50 concentration in Calu-3 cells. Cyclosporine A showed antiviral activity, but also unconventional drug-response curves and low R2 which are explained by the non-dose dependent toxicity of the compound. Additionally, Niclosamide demonstrated a conventional drug-response curve with high confidence; however, its inherent cytotoxicity may be a confounding element that misrepresents true antiviral efficacy, by reflecting cellular damage rather than a genuine antiviral action. Remdesivir was used as a control compound and was evaluated in parallel with the submitted test article and had conventional drug-response curves validating the overall results of the assay. Mebendazole was identified from the cell studies to have efficacy at non-toxic concentrations and were further evaluated in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Mebendazole administered to K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a 44.2% reduction in lung viral load compared to non-treated placebo control respectively. There were no significant differences in body weight and all clinical chemistry determinations evaluated (i.e., kidney and liver enzymes) between the different treatment groups. Conclusion: This research underscores the potential of repurposing existing compounds for treating COVID-19. Our preliminary findings underscore the therapeutic promise of several compounds, notably Mebendazole, in both in vitro and in vivo settings against SARS-CoV-2. Several of the drugs explored, especially Mebendazole, are off-label medication; their cost-effectiveness position them as economical therapies against SARS-CoV-2.

Title: A Delphi Process to Identify Relevant Outcomes That May Be Associated With a Predictive Analytic Tool to Detect Hemodynamic Deterioration in the Intensive Care Unit.
Author: ['Holder AL', 'Khanna AK', 'Scott MJ', 'Rossetti SC', 'Rinehart JB', 'Linn DD', 'Weichert J', 'Dellinger RP']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Background The critical care literature has seen an increase in the development and validation of tools using artificial intelligence for early detection of patient events or disease onset in the intensive care unit (ICU). The hemodynamic stability index (HSI) was found to have an AUC of 0.82 in predicting the need for hemodynamic intervention in the ICU. Future studies using this tool may benefit from targeting those outcomes that are more relevant to clinicians and most achievable. Methods A three-round Delphi study was conducted with a panel of 10 critical care physicians and three nurses in the United States to identify outcomes that may be most relevant and achievable with the HSI when evaluated for use in the ICU. To achieve criteria for relevance, at least 65% of panelists had to rate an outcome as a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. Results Nineteen of 24 outcomes that may be associated with the HSI achieved consensus for relevance. The Kemeny-Young approach was used to develop a matrix depicting the distribution of outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. "Reduces time spent in hemodynamic instability" and "reduces times to recognition of hemodynamic instability" were the highest-ranking outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. Conclusion This Delphi study was a feasible method to identify relevant outcomes that may be associated with an appropriate predictive analytic tool in the ICU. These findings can provide insight to researchers looking to study such tools to impact outcomes relevant to critical care practitioners. Future studies should test these tools in the ICU that target the most clinically relevant and achievable outcomes, such as time spent hemodynamically unstable or time until actionable nursing assessment or treatment.

Title: Novel application of convolutional neural networks for artificial intelligence-enabled modified moving average analysis of P-, R-, and T-wave alternans for detection of risk for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
Author: ['Nearing BD', 'Verrier RL']
Journal Title: Journal of electrocardiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) analysis was shown in >14,000 individuals studied worldwide over the past two decades to be a useful tool to assess risk for cardiovascular mortality and sudden arrhythmic death. TWA analysis by the modified moving average (MMA) method is FDA-cleared and CMS-reimbursed (CAG-00293R2). OBJECTIVE: Because the MMA technique is inherently suitable for dynamic tracking of alternans levels, it was selected for development of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled algorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve rapid, efficient, and accurate assessment of P-wave alternans (PWA), R-wave alternans (RWA), and TWA. METHODS: The novel application of CNN algorithms to enhance MMA analysis generated efficient and powerful pattern-recognition algorithms for highly accurate alternans quantification. Algorithm reliability and accuracy were verified using simulated ECGs achieving R(2) >/= 0.99 (p < 0.01) in response to noise inputs and artifacts that emulate real-life conditions. RESULTS: Accuracy of the new AI-MMA algorithms in TWA analysis (n = 5) was significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p = 0.036) and did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p = 0.21). Accuracy of AI-MMA in PWA analysis (n = 45) was significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p < 0.005) and did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p = 0.89). TWA and PWA by AI-MMA were correlated with conventional MMA output over-read by an expert reader (R(2) = 0.7765, R(2) = 0.9504, respectively). CONCLUSION: This novel technique for AI-MMA analysis could be suitable for use in diverse in-hospital and out-of-hospital monitoring systems, including cardiac implantable electronic devices and smartwatches, for tracking atrial and ventricular arrhythmia risk.

Journal Title: Computers in biology and medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 30
Abstract: Pathology diagnosis based on EEG signals and decoding brain activity holds immense importance in understanding neurological disorders. With the advancement of artificial intelligence methods and machine learning techniques, the potential for accurate data-driven diagnoses and effective treatments has grown significantly. However, applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets presents diverse challenges at multiple levels. The scarcity of labeled data, especially in low regime scenarios with limited availability of real patient cohorts due to high costs of recruitment, underscores the vital deployment of scaling and transfer learning techniques. In this study, we explore a real-world pathology classification task to highlight the effectiveness of data and model scaling and cross-dataset knowledge transfer. As such, we observe varying performance improvements through data scaling, indicating the need for careful evaluation and labeling. Additionally, we identify the challenges of possible negative transfer and emphasize the significance of some key components to overcome distribution shifts and potential spurious correlations and achieve positive transfer. We see improvement in the performance of the target model on the target (NMT) datasets by using the knowledge from the source dataset (TUAB) when a low amount of labeled data was available. Our findings demonstrated that a small and generic model (e.g. ShallowNet) performs well on a single dataset, however, a larger model (e.g. TCN) performs better in transfer learning when leveraging a larger and more diverse dataset.

Journal Title: Annals of clinical and laboratory science
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of artificial intelligence-powered language models (ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4) compared to trainees and clinical chemists in responding to common laboratory questions in the broad area of Clinical Chemistry. METHODS: 35 questions from real-life case scenarios, clinical consultations, and clinical chemistry testing questions were used to evaluate ChatGPT 3.5, and GPT-4 alongside clinical chemistry trainees (residents/fellows) and clinical chemistry faculty. The responses were scored based on category and based on years of experience. RESULTS: The Senior Chemistry Faculty demonstrated superior accuracy with 100% of correct responses compared to 90.5%, 82.9%, and 71.4% of correct responses from the junior chemistry faculty, fellows, and residents respectively. They all outperformed both ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4 which generated 60% and 71.4% correct responses respectively. Of the sub-categories examined, ChatGPT 3.5 achieved 100% accuracy in endocrinology while GPT-4 did not achieve 100% accuracy in any subcategory. GPT-4 was overall better than ChatGPT 3.5 by generating similar correct responses as residents (71.4%) but performed poorly to human participants when both partially correct and incorrect indices were considered. CONCLUSION: Despite all the advances in AI-powered language models, ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4 cannot replace a trained pathologist in answering clinical chemistry questions. Caution should be observed by people, especially those not trained in clinical chemistry, to interpret test results using chatbots.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: This work explores the complex field of HER2 testing in the HER2-low breast cancer era, with a focus on methodological aspects. We aim to propose clear positions to scientific societies, institutions, pathologists, and oncologists to guide and shape the appropriate diagnostic strategies for HER2-low breast cancer. The fundamental question at hand is whether the necessary tools to effectively translate our knowledge about HER2 into practical diagnostic schemes for the lower spectrum of expression are available. Our investigation is centered on the significance of distinguishing between an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0 and score 1+ in light of the clinical implications now apparent, as patients with HER2-low breast cancer become eligible for trastuzumab-deruxtecan treatment. Furthermore, we discuss the definition of HER2-low beyond its conventional boundaries and assess the reliability of established diagnostic procedures designed at a time when therapeutic perspectives were non-existent for these cases. In this regard, we examine potential complementary technologies, such as gene expression analysis and liquid biopsy. Ultimately, we consider the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of digital pathology and its integration into HER2 testing, with a particular emphasis on its application in the context of HER2-low breast cancer.

Abstract: When faced with an unidentified body, identifying the victim can be challenging, particularly if physical characteristics are obscured or masked. In recent years, microbiological analysis in forensic science has emerged as a cutting-edge technology. It not only exhibits individual specificity, distinguishing different human biotraces from various sites of occurrence (e.g., gastrointestinal, oral, skin, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts), each hosting distinct bacterial species, but also offers insights into the accident's location and the surrounding environment. The integration of machine learning with microbiomics provides a substantial improvement in classifying bacterial species compares to traditional sequencing techniques. This review discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as RF, SVM, ANN, DNN, regression, and BN for the detection and identification of various bacteria, including Bacillus anthracis, Acetobacter aceti, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus, among others. Deep leaning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models and derivatives, are also employed to predict the victim's age, gender, lifestyle, and racial characteristics. It is anticipated that big data analytics and artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role in advancing forensic microbiology in the future.

Abstract: Background and purpose: Intellectual disability-7 (MRD7) is a subtype disorder of intellectual disability (MRD) involving feeding difficulties, hypoactivity, and febrile seizures at an age of early onset, then progressive intellectual and physical development deterioration. We purposed to identify the underlying causative genetic factors of three individuals in each Chinese family who presented with symptoms of intellectual disability and facial dysmorphic features. We provided prenatal diagnosis for the three families and genetic counseling for the prevention of this disease. Methods: We collected retrospective clinical diagnostic evidence for the three probands in our study, which included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), electroencephalogram (EEG), and intelligence tests for the three probands in our study. Genetic investigation of the probands and their next of kin was performed by Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR technologies were then used as the next step to verify the variants confirmed with Trio-WES for the three families. Moreover, we performed amniocentesis to explore the state of the three pathogenic variants in the fetuses by prenatal molecular genetic diagnosis at an appropriate gestational period for the three families. Results: The three probands and one fetus were clinically diagnosed with microcephaly and exhibited intellectual developmental disability, postnatal feeding difficulties, and facial dysmorphic features. Combining probands' clinical manifestations, Trio-WES uncovered the three heterozygous variants in DYRK1A: a novel variant exon3_exon4del p.(Gly4_Asn109del), a novel variant c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*), and a previously presented but rare pathogenic variant c.1309C>T p.(Arg437*) (NM_001396.5) in three families, respectively. In light of the updated American College of Medical Genetic and Genomics (ACMG) criterion, the variant of exon3_exon4del and c.1159C>T were both classified as likely pathogenic (PSV1+PM6), while c1309C>T was identified as pathogenic (PVS1+PS2_Moderate+PM2). Considering clinical features and molecular testimony, the three probands were confirmed diagnosed with MRD7. These three discovered variants were considered as the three causal mutations for MRD7. Prenatal diagnosis detected the heterozygous dominant variant of c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*) in one of the fetuses, indicating a significant probability of MRD7, subsequently the gestation was intervened by the parents' determination and professional obstetrical operation. On the other side, prenatal molecular genetic testing revealed wild-type alleles in the other two fetuses, and their parents both decided to sustain the gestation. Conclusion: We identified two novel and one rare mutation in DYRK1A which has broadened the spectrum of DYRK1A and provided evidence for the diagnosis of MRD7 at the molecular level. Besides, this study has supported the three families with MRD7 to determine the causative genetic factors efficiently and provide concise genetic counseling for the three families by using Trio-WES technology.
