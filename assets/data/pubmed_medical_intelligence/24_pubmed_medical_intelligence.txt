Journal Title: Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We tested the ability of chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence chatbot, to answer questions relevant to scenarios covered in 3 clinical guidelines, published by the Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SNACC), which has published management guidelines: endovascular treatment of stroke, perioperative stroke (Stroke), and care of patients undergoing complex spine surgery (Spine). METHODS: Four neuroanesthesiologists independently assessed whether ChatGPT could apply 52 high-quality recommendations (HQRs) included in the 3 SNACC guidelines. HQRs were deemed present in the ChatGPT responses if noted by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers. Reviewers also identified incorrect references, potentially harmful recommendations, and whether ChatGPT cited the SNACC guidelines. RESULTS: The overall reviewer agreement for the presence of HQRs in the ChatGPT answers ranged from 0% to 100%. Only 4 of 52 (8%) HQRs were deemed present by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers after 5 generic questions, and 23 (44%) HQRs were deemed present after at least 1 additional targeted question. Potentially harmful recommendations were identified for each of the 3 clinical scenarios and ChatGPT failed to cite the SNACC guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The ChatGPT answers were open to human interpretation regarding whether the responses included the HQRs. Though targeted questions resulted in the inclusion of more HQRs than generic questions, fewer than 50% of HQRs were noted even after targeted questions. This suggests that ChatGPT should not currently be considered a reliable source of information for clinical decision-making. Future iterations of ChatGPT may refine algorithms to improve its reliability as a source of clinical information.

Journal Title: Age and ageing
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare describes algorithm-based computational techniques which manage and analyse large datasets to make inferences and predictions. There are many potential applications of AI in the care of older people, from clinical decision support systems that can support identification of delirium from clinical records to wearable devices that can predict the risk of a fall. We held four meetings of older people, clinicians and AI researchers. Three priority areas were identified for AI application in the care of older people. These included: monitoring and early diagnosis of disease, stratified care and care coordination between healthcare providers. However, the meetings also highlighted concerns that AI may exacerbate health inequity for older people through bias within AI models, lack of external validation amongst older people, infringements on privacy and autonomy, insufficient transparency of AI models and lack of safeguarding for errors. Creating effective interventions for older people requires a person-centred approach to account for the needs of older people, as well as sufficient clinical and technological governance to meet standards of generalisability, transparency and effectiveness. Education of clinicians and patients is also needed to ensure appropriate use of AI technologies, with investment in technological infrastructure required to ensure equity of access.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are proposed as a replacement of the first reader in double reading within mammography screening. We aimed to assess cancer detection accuracy of an AI system in a Danish screening population. METHODS: We retrieved a consecutive screening cohort from the Region of Southern Denmark including all participating women between Aug 4, 2014, and August 15, 2018. Screening mammograms were processed by a commercial AI system and detection accuracy was evaluated in two scenarios, Standalone AI and AI-integrated screening replacing first reader, with first reader and double reading with arbitration (combined reading) as comparators, respectively. Two AI-score cut-off points were applied by matching at mean first reader sensitivity (AI(sens)) and specificity (AI(spec)). Reference standard was histopathology-proven breast cancer or cancer-free follow-up within 24 months. Coprimary endpoints were sensitivity and specificity, and secondary endpoints were positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), recall rate, and arbitration rate. Accuracy estimates were calculated using McNemar's test or exact binomial test. RESULTS: Out of 272,008 screening mammograms from 158,732 women, 257,671 (94.7%) with adequate image data were included in the final analyses. Sensitivity and specificity were 63.7% (95% CI 61.6%-65.8%) and 97.8% (97.7-97.8%) for first reader, and 73.9% (72.0-75.8%) and 97.9% (97.9-98.0%) for combined reading, respectively. Standalone AI(sens) showed a lower specificity (-1.3%) and PPV (-6.1%), and a higher recall rate (+ 1.3%) compared to first reader (p < 0.0001 for all), while Standalone AI(spec) had a lower sensitivity (-5.1%; p < 0.0001), PPV (-1.3%; p = 0.01) and NPV (-0.04%; p = 0.0002). Compared to combined reading, Integrated AI(sens) achieved higher sensitivity (+ 2.3%; p = 0.0004), but lower specificity (-0.6%) and PPV (-3.9%) as well as higher recall rate (+ 0.6%) and arbitration rate (+ 2.2%; p < 0.0001 for all). Integrated AI(spec) showed no significant difference in any outcome measures apart from a slightly higher arbitration rate (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses showed higher detection of interval cancers by Standalone AI and Integrated AI at both thresholds (p < 0.0001 for all) with a varying composition of detected cancers across multiple subgroups of tumour characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing first reader in double reading with an AI could be feasible but choosing an appropriate AI threshold is crucial to maintaining cancer detection accuracy and workload.

Abstract: White matter dysmaturation is commonly seen in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Animal research has shown that active sleep is essential for early brain plasticity. This study aimed to determine the potential of active sleep as an early predictor for subsequent white matter development in preterm infants. Using heart and respiratory rates routinely monitored in the NICU, we developed a machine learning-based automated sleep stage classifier in a cohort of 25 preterm infants. The automated classifier was subsequently applied to a study cohort of 58 preterm infants (31 females) to extract active sleep percentage over 5-7 consecutive days during 29-32 weeks of postmenstrual age. Each of the 58 infants underwent high-quality T2-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging at term-equivalent age, which was used to measure total white matter volume. The association between active sleep percentage and white matter volume was examined using a multiple linear regression model adjusted for potential confounders. Using the automated classifier with a superior sleep classification performance (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.83-0.92), we found that a higher active sleep percentage during the preterm period was significantly associated with increased white matter volume at term-equivalent age (beta = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.09-0.53; FDR-adjusted P-value = 0.021). Our results extend the positive association between active sleep and early brain development found in animal research to human preterm infants and emphasise the potential benefit of sleep preservation in the NICU setting.Significance Statement Preterm infants face a high risk of white matter abnormalities. Evidence from animal studies has highlighted the crucial role that active sleep plays in early brain development. This study examined the association between artificial intelligence-derived active sleep and white matter development in human preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The results revealed that preterm infants with higher active sleep percentages during their NICU stay exhibited significantly larger white matter volumes at term-equivalent age. Our findings suggest the potential benefits of safeguarding sleep, particularly active sleep, in the NICU. By incorporating automated sleep monitoring into routine caregiving practices, caregivers can tailor elective care according to an infant's sleep cycles, thereby promoting optimal early brain development.

Journal Title: AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: In the fall of 2021, several experts in this space delivered a Webinar hosted by the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) Diversity and Inclusion Committee, focused on expanding the understanding of bias in artificial intelligence, with a health equity lens, and provided key concepts for neuroradiologists to approach the evaluation of these tools. In this perspective, we distill key parts of this discussion, including understanding why this topic is important to neuroradiologists and lending insight on how neuroradiologists can develop a framework to assess health equity-related bias in artificial intelligence tools. In addition, we provide examples of clinical workflow implementation of these tools so that we can begin to see how artificial intelligence tools will impact discourse on equitable radiologic care. As continuous learners, we must be engaged in new and rapidly evolving technologies that emerge in our field. The Diversity and Inclusion Committee of the ASNR has addressed this subject matter through its programming content revolving around health equity in neuroradiologic advances.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: BoneXpert (BX) is an artificial intelligence software used primarily for bone age assessment. Besides, it can also be used to screen for bone health using the digital radiogrammetry tool called bone health index (BHI) for which normative reference values available are calculated from healthy European children. Due to ethnic difference in bone geometry, in a previous study, we generated reference curves based on healthy Indian children. The objectives of this study were: 1) To assess and compare bone health of Indian children with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) using both European and Indian BHI SDS reference data and 2) To identify determinants of poor bone health in Indian children and youth with T1D by using BHI tool (based on BHI-SDS Indian reference data) of BX. METHOD: The BHI was assessed retrospectively in 1159 subjects with T1D using digitalised left-hand x-rays and SDS were computed using European and Indian data. The demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biochemistry, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data collection were performed using standard protocols and were extracted from hospital records. RESULTS: The BHI correlated well with DXA and pQCT parameters in subjects with T1D. BHI-SDS calculated using Indian reference data had better correlation with height and DXA parameters. 8.6% study participants had low (less than -2) BHI-SDS (Indian), with height SDS having significant effect. Subjects with low BHI-SDS were older, shorter and had higher duration of diabetes. They also had lower IGF1 and vitamin D concentrations, bone mineral density, and trabecular density. Female gender, increased duration of illness, poor glycaemic control, and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency were significant predictors of poor BHI-SDS. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the utility of digital radiogrammetry AI tool to screen for bone health of children with T1D and demonstrates and highlights the necessity of interpretation using ethnicity specific normative data.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models are making significant strides in various fields, such as natural language processing(1-5), biology(6,7), chemistry(8-10) and computer programming(11,12). Here, we show the development and capabilities of Coscientist, an artificial intelligence system driven by GPT-4 that autonomously designs, plans and performs complex experiments by incorporating large language models empowered by tools such as internet and documentation search, code execution and experimental automation. Coscientist showcases its potential for accelerating research across six diverse tasks, including the successful reaction optimization of palladium-catalysed cross-couplings, while exhibiting advanced capabilities for (semi-)autonomous experimental design and execution. Our findings demonstrate the versatility, efficacy and explainability of artificial intelligence systems like Coscientist in advancing research.

Abstract: Moire quantum materials host exotic electronic phenomena through enhanced internal Coulomb interactions in twisted two-dimensional heterostructures(1-4). When combined with the exceptionally high electrostatic control in atomically thin materials(5-8), moire heterostructures have the potential to enable next-generation electronic devices with unprecedented functionality. However, despite extensive exploration, moire electronic phenomena have thus far been limited to impractically low cryogenic temperatures(9-14), thus precluding real-world applications of moire quantum materials. Here we report the experimental realization and room-temperature operation of a low-power (20 pW) moire synaptic transistor based on an asymmetric bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride moire heterostructure. The asymmetric moire potential gives rise to robust electronic ratchet states, which enable hysteretic, non-volatile injection of charge carriers that control the conductance of the device. The asymmetric gating in dual-gated moire heterostructures realizes diverse biorealistic neuromorphic functionalities, such as reconfigurable synaptic responses, spatiotemporal-based tempotrons and Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro input-specific adaptation. In this manner, the moire synaptic transistor enables efficient compute-in-memory designs and edge hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: The current study provides the numerical solutions of the language-based model through the artificial intelligence (AI) procedure based on the scale conjugate gradient neural network (SCJGNN). The mathematical learning language differential model is characterized into three classes, named as unknown, familiar, and mastered. A dataset is generalized by using the performance of the Adam scheme, which is used to reduce to mean square error. The AI based SCJGNN procedure works by taking the data with the ratio of testing (12%), validation (13%), and training (75%). An activation log-sigmoid function, twelve numbers of neurons, SCJG optimization, hidden and output layers are presented in this stochastic computing work for solving the learning language model. The correctness of AI based SCJGNN is noted through the overlapping of the results along with the small calculated absolute error that are around 10(-06) to 10(-08) for each class of the model. Moreover, the regression performances for each case of the model is performed as one that shows the perfect model. Additionally, the dependability of AI based SCJGNN is approved using the histogram, and function fitness.

Abstract: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease whose activity is often assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28-CRP). The present study was designed to investigate the significance of individual components within the score for PsA activity. A cohort of 80 PsA patients (44 women and 36 men, aged 56.3 +/- 12 years) with a range of disease activity from remission to moderate was analyzed using unsupervised and supervised methods applied to the DAS28-CRP components. Machine learning-based permutation importance identified tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the right index finger as the most informative item of the DAS28-CRP for PsA activity staging. This symptom alone allowed a machine learned (random forests) classifier to identify PsA remission with 67% balanced accuracy in new cases. Projection of the DAS28-CRP data onto an emergent self-organizing map of artificial neurons identified outliers, which following augmentation of group sizes by emergent self-organizing maps based generative artificial intelligence (AI) could be defined as subgroups particularly characterized by either tenderness or swelling of specific joints. AI-assisted re-evaluation of the DAS28-CRP for PsA has narrowed the score items to a most relevant symptom, and generative AI has been useful for identifying and characterizing small subgroups of patients whose symptom patterns differ from the majority. These findings represent an important step toward precision medicine that can address outliers.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patients face daily difficulties in keeping their blood glucose levels within appropriate ranges. Several techniques and devices, such as flash glucose meters, have been developed to help T1D patients improve their quality of life. Most recently, the data collected via these devices is being used to train advanced artificial intelligence models to characterize the evolution of the disease and support its management. Data scarcity is the main challenge for generating these models, as most works use private or artificially generated datasets. For this reason, this work presents T1DiabetesGranada, an open under specific permission longitudinal dataset that not only provides continuous glucose levels, but also patient demographic and clinical information. The dataset includes 257 780 days of measurements spanning four years from 736 T1D patients from the province of Granada, Spain. This dataset advances beyond the state of the art as one the longest and largest open datasets of continuous glucose measurements, thus boosting the development of new artificial intelligence models for glucose level characterization and prediction.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: Gliomas are the commonest malignant central nervous system tumours in adults and imaging is the cornerstone of diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment follow-up of these patients. With the ever-evolving treatment strategies post-treatment imaging and interpretation in glioma remains challenging, more so with the advent of anti-angiogenic drugs and immunotherapy, which can significantly alter the appearance in this setting, thus making interpretation of routine imaging findings such as contrast enhancement, oedema, and mass effect difficult to interpret. This review details the various methods of management of glioma including the upcoming novel therapies and their impact on imaging findings, with a comprehensive description of the imaging findings in conventional and advanced imaging techniques. A systematic appraisal for the existing and emerging techniques of imaging in these settings and their clinical application including various response assessment guidelines and artificial intelligence based response assessment will also be discussed.

Title: Vulnerability assessment of heat waves within a risk framework using artificial intelligence.
Author: ['Cote JN', 'Germain M', 'Levac E', 'Lavigne E']
Journal Title: The Science of the total environment
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: Current efforts to adapt to climate change are not sufficient to reduce projected impacts. Vulnerability assessments are essential to allocate resources where they are needed most. However, current assessments that use principal component analysis suffer from multiple shortcomings and are hard to translate into concrete actions. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel data-driven vulnerability assessment within a risk framework. The framework is based on the definitions from the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but some definitions, such as sensitivity and adaptive capacity, are clarified. Heat waves that occurred between 2001 and 2018 in Quebec (Canada) are used to validate the framework. The studied impact is the daily mortality rates per cooling degree-days (CDD) region. A vulnerability map is produced to identify the distributions of summer mortality rates in aggregate dissemination areas within each CDD region. Socioeconomic and environmental variables are used to calculate impact and vulnerability. We compared abilities of AutoGluon (an AutoML framework), Gaussian process, and deep Gaussian process to model the impact and vulnerability. We offer advice on how to avoid common pitfalls with artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms. Gaussian process is a promising approach for supporting the proposed framework. SHAP values provide an explanation for the model results and are consistent with current knowledge of vulnerability. Recommendations are made to implement the proposed framework quantitatively or qualitatively.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: Panax notoginseng powder (PNP) has high medicinal value and is widely used in the medical and health food industries. However, the adulteration of PNP in the market has dramatically reduced its efficacy. Therefore, this study intends to use artificial intelligence sensory (AIS) and multi-source information fusion (MIF) technology to try to establish a quality evaluation system for different grades of PNP and adulterated Panax notoginseng powder (AD-PNP). The highest accuracy rate reached 100% in identifying PNP grade and adulteration. In the prediction of adulteration ratio and total saponin content, the optimal determination coefficients of the test set were 0.9965 and 0.9948, respectively, and the root mean square errors were 0.0109 and 0.0123, respectively. Therefore, the grade identification method of PNP and the evaluation system of AD-PNP based on AIS and MIF technology can rapidly and accurately evaluate the quality of PNP.

Author: ['Guo L', 'Zhao S', 'Yang J', 'Kitipornchai S']
Journal Title: Ultrasonics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: The advance of artificial intelligence and graphene-based composites brings new vitality into the conventional design of acoustic lenses which suffers from high computation cost and difficulties in achieving precise desired refractive indices. This paper presents an efficient and accurate design methodology for graphene-based gradient-index phononic crystal (GGPC) lenses by combing theoretical formulations and machine learning methods. The GGPC lenses consist of two-dimensional phononic crystals possessing square unit cells with graphene-based composite inclusions. The plane wave expansion method is exploited to obtain the dispersion relations of elastic waves in the structures and then establish the data sets of the effective refractive indices in structures with different volume fractions of graphene fillers in composite materials and filling fractions of inclusions. Based on the database established by the theoretical formulation, genetic programming, a superior machine learning algorithm, is introduced to generate explicit mathematical expressions to predict the effective refractive indices under different structural information. The design of GGPC lenses is conducted with the assistance of the machine learning prediction model, and it will be illustrated by several typical design examples. The proposed design method offers high efficiency, accuracy as well as the ability to achieve inverse design of GGPC lenses, thus significantly facilitating the development of novel phononic crystal lenses and acoustic energy focusing.

Abstract: Since cancer is one of the world's top causes of death, early diagnosis is critical to improving patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a viable technique for cancer diagnosis by using machine learning algorithms to examine large volumes of data for accurate and efficient diagnosis. AI has the potential to alter the way cancer is detected fundamentally. Still, it has several disadvantages, such as requiring a large amount of data, technological limitations, and ethical concerns. This overview looks at the possibilities and restrictions of AI in cancer detection, as well as current applications and possible future developments. We can better understand how to use AI to improve patient outcomes and reduce cancer mortality rates by looking at its potential for cancer detection.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: Limbless locomotors, from microscopic worms to macroscopic snakes, traverse complex, heterogeneous natural environments typically using undulatory body wave propagation. Theoretical and robophysical models typically emphasize body kinematics and active neural/electronic control. However, we contend that because such approaches often neglect the role of passive, mechanically controlled processes (those involving "mechanical intelligence"), they fail to reproduce the performance of even the simplest organisms. To uncover principles of how mechanical intelligence aids limbless locomotion in heterogeneous terradynamic regimes, here we conduct a comparative study of locomotion in a model of heterogeneous terrain (lattices of rigid posts). We used a model biological system, the highly studied nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and a robophysical device whose bilateral actuator morphology models that of limbless organisms across scales. The robot's kinematics quantitatively reproduced the performance of the nematodes with purely open-loop control; mechanical intelligence simplified control of obstacle navigation and exploitation by reducing the need for active sensing and feedback. An active behavior observed in C. elegans, undulatory wave reversal upon head collisions, robustified locomotion via exploitation of the systems' mechanical intelligence. Our study provides insights into how neurally simple limbless organisms like nematodes can leverage mechanical intelligence via appropriately tuned bilateral actuation to locomote in complex environments. These principles likely apply to neurally more sophisticated organisms and also provide a design and control paradigm for limbless robots for applications like search and rescue and planetary exploration.

Abstract: Digital health tools, platforms, and artificial intelligence- or machine learning-based clinical decision support systems are increasingly part of health delivery approaches, with an ever-greater degree of system interaction. Critical to the successful deployment of these tools is their functional integration into existing clinical routines and workflows. This depends on system interoperability and on intuitive and safe user interface design. The importance of minimizing emergent workflow stress through human factors research and purposeful design for integration cannot be overstated. Usability of tools in practice is as important as algorithm quality. Regulatory and health technology assessment frameworks recognize the importance of these factors to a certain extent, but their focus remains mainly on the individual product rather than on emergent system and workflow effects. The measurement of performance and user experience has so far been performed in ad hoc, nonstandardized ways by individual actors using their own evaluation approaches. We propose that a standard framework for system-level and holistic evaluation could be built into interacting digital systems to enable systematic and standardized system-wide, multiproduct, postmarket surveillance and technology assessment. Such a system could be made available to developers through regulatory or assessment bodies as an application programming interface and could be a requirement for digital tool certification, just as interoperability is. This would enable health systems and tool developers to collect system-level data directly from real device use cases, enabling the controlled and safe delivery of systematic quality assessment or improvement studies suitable for the complexity and interconnectedness of clinical workflows using developing digital health technologies.
