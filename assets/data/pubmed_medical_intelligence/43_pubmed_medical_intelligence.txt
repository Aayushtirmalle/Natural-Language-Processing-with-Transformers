Abstract: Within the broader context of improving interactions between artificial intelligence and humans, the question has arisen regarding whether auditory and rhythmic support could increase attention for visual stimuli that do not stand out clearly from an information stream. To this end, we designed an experiment inspired by pip-and-pop but more appropriate for eliciting attention and P3a-event-related potentials (ERPs). In this study, the aim was to distinguish between targets and distractors based on the subject's electroencephalography (EEG) data. We achieved this objective by employing different machine learning (ML) methods for both individual-subject (IS) and cross-subject (CS) models. Finally, we investigated which EEG channels and time points were used by the model to make its predictions using saliency maps. We were able to successfully perform the aforementioned classification task for both the IS and CS scenarios, reaching classification accuracies up to 76%. In accordance with the literature, the model primarily used the parietal-occipital electrodes between 200 ms and 300 ms after the stimulus to make its prediction. The findings from this research contribute to the development of more effective P300-based brain-computer interfaces. Furthermore, they validate the EEG data collected in our experiment.

Abstract: The proliferation and great variety of low-cost air quality (AQ) sensors, combined with their flexibility and energy efficiency, gives an opportunity to integrate them into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). However, with these sensors, AQ monitoring poses a significant challenge, as the data collection and analysis process is complex and prone to errors. Although these sensors do not meet the performance requirements for reference regulatory-equivalent monitoring, they can provide informative measurements and more if we can adjust and add further processing to their raw measurements. Therefore, the integration of these sensors aims to facilitate real-time monitoring and achieve a higher spatial and temporal sampling density, particularly in urban areas, where there is a strong interest in providing AQ surveillance services since there is an increase in respiratory/allergic issues among the population. Leveraging a network of low-cost sensors, supported by 5G communications in combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (using Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNN and DNN)) to predict 24-h-ahead readings is the goal of this article in order to be able to provide early warnings to the populations of hazards areas. We have evaluated four different neural network architectures: Multi-Linear prediction (with a dense Multi-Linear Neural Network (NN)), Multi-Dense network prediction, Multi-Convolutional network prediction, and Multi-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network prediction. To perform the training of the prediction of the readings, we have prepared a significant dataset that is analyzed and processed for training and testing, achieving an estimation error for most of the predicted parameters of around 7.2% on average, with the best option being the Multi-LSTM network in the forthcoming 24 h. It is worth mentioning that some pollutants achieved lower estimation errors, such as CO2 with 0.1%, PM10 with 2.4% (as well as PM2.5 and PM1.0), and NO2 with 6.7%.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled human-centered smart healthcare monitoring system can be useful in life saving, specifically for diabetes patients. Diabetes and heart patients need real-time and remote monitoring and recommendation-based medical assistance. Such human-centered smart healthcare systems can not only provide continuous medical assistance to diabetes patients but can also reduce overall medical expenses. In the last decade, machine learning has been successfully implemented to design more accurate and precise medical applications. In this paper, a smart sensing technologies-based architecture is proposed that uses AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) for continuous monitoring and health assistance for diabetes patients. The designed system senses various health parameters, such as blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose (non-invasively), body temperature, and pulse rate, using a wrist band. We also designed a non-invasive blood sugar sensor using a near-infrared (NIR) sensor. The proposed system can predict the patient's health condition, which is evaluated by a set of machine learning algorithms with the support of a fuzzy logic decision-making system. The designed system was validated on a large data set of 50 diabetes patients. The results of the simulation manifest that the random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy in comparison to other machine learning algorithms. The system predicts the patient's condition accurately and sends it to the doctor's portal.

Title: Rapid Determination of Wine Grape Maturity Level from pH, Titratable Acidity, and Sugar Content Using Non-Destructive In Situ Infrared Spectroscopy and Multi-Head Attention Convolutional Neural Networks.

Abstract: In the pursuit of enhancing the wine production process through the utilization of new technologies in viticulture, this study presents a novel approach for the rapid assessment of wine grape maturity levels using non-destructive, in situ infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence techniques. Building upon our previous work focused on estimating sugar content ( composite functionBrix) from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions, this research expands its scope to encompass pH and titratable acidity, critical parameters determining the grape maturity degree, and in turn, wine quality, offering a more representative estimation pathway. Data were collected from four grape varieties-Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon Blanc, and Syrah-during the 2023 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages in the vineyards of Ktima Gerovassiliou, northern Greece. A comprehensive spectral library was developed, covering the VNIR-SWIR spectrum (350-2500 nm), with measurements performed in situ. Ground truth data for pH, titratable acidity, and sugar content were obtained using conventional laboratory methods: total soluble solids (TSS) ( composite functionBrix) by refractometry, titratable acidity by titration (expressed as mg tartaric acid per liter of must) and pH by a pH meter, analyzed at different maturation stages in the must samples. The maturity indicators were predicted from the point hyperspectral data by employing machine learning algorithms, including Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in conjunction with various pre-processing techniques. Multi-output models were also considered to simultaneously predict all three indicators to exploit their intercorrelations. A novel multi-input-multi-output CNN model was also proposed, incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism and enabling the identification of the spectral regions it focuses on, and thus having a higher interpretability degree. Our results indicate high accuracy in the estimation of sugar content, pH, and titratable acidity, with the best models yielding mean R2 values of 0.84, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively, across all properties. The multi-output models did not improve the prediction results compared to the best single-output models, and the proposed CNN model was on par with the next best model. The interpretability analysis highlighted that the CNN model focused on spectral regions associated with the presence of sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose) and of the carboxylic acid group. This study underscores the potential of portable spectrometry for real-time, non-destructive assessments of wine grape maturity, thereby providing valuable tools for informed decision making in the wine production industry. By integrating pH and titratable acidity into the analysis, our approach offers a holistic view of grape quality, facilitating more comprehensive and efficient viticultural practices.

Title: A Bibliometric Analysis of Neuroscience Tools Use in Construction Health and Safety Management.
Author: ['Ding Z', 'Xiong Z', 'Ouyang Y']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: Despite longstanding traditional construction health and safety management (CHSM) methods, the construction industry continues to face persistent challenges in this field. Neuroscience tools offer potential advantages in addressing these safety and health issues by providing objective data to indicate subjects' cognition and behavior. The application of neuroscience tools in the CHSM has received much attention in the construction research community, but comprehensive statistics on the application of neuroscience tools to CHSM is lacking to provide insights for the later scholars. Therefore, this study applied bibliometric analysis to examine the current state of neuroscience tools use in CHSM. The development phases; the most productive journals, regions, and institutions; influential scholars and articles; author collaboration; reference co-citation; and application domains of the tools were identified. It revealed four application domains: monitoring the safety status of construction workers, enhancing the construction hazard recognition ability, reducing work-related musculoskeletal disorders of construction workers, and integrating neuroscience tools with artificial intelligence techniques in enhancing occupational safety and health, where magnetoencephalography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and electrodermal activity (EDA) are four predominant neuroscience tools. It also shows a growing interest in integrating the neuroscience tools with artificial intelligence techniques to address the safety and health issues. In addition, future studies are suggested to facilitate the applications of these tools in construction workplaces by narrowing the gaps between experimental settings and real situations, enhancing the quality of data collected by neuroscience tools and performance of data processing algorithms, and overcoming user resistance in tools adoption.

Author: ['Shajari S', 'Kuruvinashetti K', 'Komeili A', 'Sundararaj U']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Disease diagnosis and monitoring using conventional healthcare services is typically expensive and has limited accuracy. Wearable health technology based on flexible electronics has gained tremendous attention in recent years for monitoring patient health owing to attractive features, such as lower medical costs, quick access to patient health data, ability to operate and transmit data in harsh environments, storage at room temperature, non-invasive implementation, mass scaling, etc. This technology provides an opportunity for disease pre-diagnosis and immediate therapy. Wearable sensors have opened a new area of personalized health monitoring by accurately measuring physical states and biochemical signals. Despite the progress to date in the development of wearable sensors, there are still several limitations in the accuracy of the data collected, precise disease diagnosis, and early treatment. This necessitates advances in applied materials and structures and using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wearable sensors to extract target signals for accurate clinical decision-making and efficient medical care. In this paper, we review two significant aspects of smart wearable sensors. First, we offer an overview of the most recent progress in improving wearable sensor performance for physical, chemical, and biosensors, focusing on materials, structural configurations, and transduction mechanisms. Next, we review the use of AI technology in combination with wearable technology for big data processing, self-learning, power-efficiency, real-time data acquisition and processing, and personalized health for an intelligent sensing platform. Finally, we present the challenges and future opportunities associated with smart wearable sensors.

Abstract: In recent years, more and more devices are connected to the network, generating an overwhelming amount of data. This term that is booming today is known as the Internet of Things. In order to deal with these data close to the source, the term Edge Computing arises. The main objective is to address the limitations of cloud processing and satisfy the growing demand for applications and services that require low latency, greater efficiency and real-time response capabilities. Furthermore, it is essential to underscore the intrinsic connection between artificial intelligence and edge computing within the context of our study. This integral relationship not only addresses the challenges posed by data proliferation but also propels a transformative wave of innovation, shaping a new era of data processing capabilities at the network's edge. Edge devices can perform real-time data analysis and make autonomous decisions without relying on constant connectivity to the cloud. This article aims at analysing and comparing Edge Computing devices when artificial intelligence algorithms are deployed on them. To this end, a detailed experiment involving various edge devices, models and metrics is conducted. In addition, we will observe how artificial intelligence accelerators such as Tensor Processing Unit behave. This analysis seeks to respond to the choice of a device that best suits the necessary AI requirements. As a summary, in general terms, the Jetson Nano provides the best performance when only CPU is used. Nevertheless the utilisation of a TPU drastically enhances the results.

Title: Multi-UAV Redeployment Optimization Based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Oriented to Swarm Performance Restoration.
Author: ['Wu Q', 'Geng Z', 'Ren Y', 'Feng Q', 'Zhong J']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 28
Abstract: Distributed artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied to multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs). This poses challenges to the distributed reconfiguration (DR) required for the optimal redeployment of multi-UAVs in the event of vehicle destruction. This paper presents a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based DR strategy (DRS) that optimizes the multi-UAV group redeployment in terms of swarm performance. To generate a two-layer DRS between multiple groups and a single group, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is developed in which a QMIX network determines the swarm redeployment, and each deep Q-network determines the single-group redeployment. The proposed method is simulated using Python and a case study demonstrates its effectiveness as a high-quality DRS for large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Service robots perform versatile functions in indoor environments. This study focuses on obstacle avoidance using flock-type indoor-based multi-robots. Each robot was developed with rendezvous behavior and distributed intelligence to perform obstacle avoidance. The hardware scheme-based obstacle-avoidance algorithm was developed using a bio-inspired flock approach, which was developed with three stages. Initially, the algorithm estimates polygonal obstacles and their orientations. The second stage involves performing avoidance at different orientations of obstacles using a heuristic based Bug2 algorithm. The final stage involves performing a flock rendezvous with distributed approaches and linear movements using a behavioral control mechanism. VLSI architectures were developed for multi-robot obstacle avoidance algorithms and were coded using Verilog HDL. The novel design of this article integrates the multi-robot's obstacle approaches with behavioral control and hardware scheme-based partial reconfiguration (PR) flow. The experiments were validated using FPGA-based multi-robots.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: In recent years, technological advancements in sensor, communication, and data storage technologies have led to the increasingly widespread use of smart devices in different types of buildings, such as residential homes, offices, and industrial installations. The main benefit of using these devices is the possibility of enhancing different crucial aspects of life within these buildings, including energy efficiency, safety, health, and occupant comfort. In particular, the fast progress in the field of the Internet of Things has yielded exponential growth in the number of connected smart devices and, consequently, increased the volume of data generated and exchanged. However, traditional Cloud-Computing platforms have exhibited limitations in their capacity to handle and process the continuous data exchange, leading to the rise of new computing paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing. In this new complex scenario, advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can play a key role in analyzing the generated data and predicting unexpected or anomalous events, allowing for quickly setting up effective responses against these unexpected events. To the best of our knowledge, current literature lacks Deep-Learning-based approaches specifically devised for guaranteeing safety in IoT-Based Smart Buildings. For this reason, we adopt an unsupervised neural architecture for detecting anomalies, such as faults, fires, theft attempts, and more, in such contexts. In more detail, in our proposal, data from a sensor network are processed by a Sparse U-Net neural model. The proposed approach is lightweight, making it suitable for deployment on the edge nodes of the network, and it does not require a pre-labeled training dataset. Experimental results conducted on a real-world case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed solution.

Abstract: In this paper, the practical application of a bio-inspired antenna for partial discharge (PD) detection in high voltage equipment was evaluated in order to validate the efficiency of using this technology for PD monitoring purposes. For this, PD measurements using the bio-inspired antenna were performed on operational 69 kV potential transformers (PT) in a real substation. After the field experiment, laboratory measurements using the IEC 60270 standard method and a bio-inspired antenna were performed, simultaneously, over the evaluated PT. The results obtained at the substation indicated suspicious frequencies of partial discharge activity in two out of three evaluated potential transformers, mainly for the frequencies of 461 MHz, 1366 MHz, 1550 MHz and 1960 MHz. During the laboratory tests, the presence of partial discharge activity over the suspicious potential transformers was confirmed with the detection of PD apparent charge levels above 20 pC. Finally, the frequency spectrum obtained from the PD signals detected by the bio-inspired antenna in the laboratory presented similar frequency values to those obtained during the practical application at the substation, making it a promising indicator for future defect classification studies using artificial intelligence.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread application of artificial intelligence algorithms in protein structure, function prediction, and de novo protein design has significantly accelerated the process of intelligent protein design and led to many noteworthy achievements. This advancement in protein intelligent design holds great potential to accelerate the development of new drugs, enhance the efficiency of biocatalysts, and even create entirely new biomaterials. Protein characterization is the key to the performance of intelligent protein design. However, there is no consensus on the most suitable characterization method for intelligent protein design tasks. This review describes the methods, characteristics, and representative applications of traditional descriptors, sequence-based and structure-based protein characterization. It discusses their advantages, disadvantages, and scope of application. It is hoped that this could help researchers to better understand the limitations and application scenarios of these methods, and provide valuable references for choosing appropriate protein characterization techniques for related research in the field, so as to better carry out protein research.

Journal Title: Cancers
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 2
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence to improve the access of cancer patients to high-quality medical care is one of the goals of modern medicine. Pathology constitutes the foundation of modern oncologic treatment, and its role has expanded far beyond diagnosis into predicting treatment response and overall survival. However, the funding of pathology is often an afterthought in resource-scarce medical systems. The increased digitalization of pathology has paved the way towards the potential use of artificial intelligence tools for improving pathologist efficiency and extracting more information from tissues. In this review, we provide an overview of the main research directions intersecting with artificial intelligence and pathology in relation to oncology, such as tumor classification, the prediction of molecular alterations, and biomarker quantification. We then discuss examples of tools that have matured into clinical products and gained regulatory approval for clinical use. Finally, we highlight the main hurdles that stand in the way of the digitalization of pathology and the application of artificial intelligence in pathology while also discussing possible solutions.

Title: DFCCNet: A Dense Flock of Chickens Counting Network Based on Density Map Regression.
Author: ['Lv J', 'Wang J', 'Peng C', 'Huang Q']
Journal Title: Animals : an open access journal from MDPI
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence, automatically and accurately counting chickens has become a reality. However, insufficient lighting, irregular sizes, and dense flocks make this a challenging task. The existing methods cannot perform accurate and stable counting. In this article, a dense flock of chickens counting network (DFCCNet) is proposed based on density map regression, where features from different levels are merged using feature fusion to obtain more information for distinguishing chickens from the background, resulting in more stable counting results. Multi-scaling is used to detect and count chickens at various scales, which can improve the counting accuracy and ensure stable performance for chickens of different sizes. Feature convolution kernels are adopted to convolve feature maps, which can extract more accurate target information, reduce the impact of occlusion, and achieve more reliable and precise results. A dataset of dense flocks of chickens (namely Dense-Chicken) has been collected and constructed, which contains 600 images of 99,916 chickens, with labeled points and boxes. It can be accessed by researchers as benchmark data. The proposed method was compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms, to validate its effectiveness. With its robustness being verified by counting in three kinds of density situations, with the mean absolute error being 4.26, 9.85, and 19.17, respectively, and a speed of 16.15 FPS. DFCCNet provides an automatic and fast approach to counting chickens in a dense farming environment. It can be easily embedded into handheld devices for application in agricultural engineering.

Abstract: As the number of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) examinations is expected to increase, technologies to optimize the imaging workflow are of great interest. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve clinical workflow and diagnostic accuracy in high-volume cardiac imaging centers. A total of 120 patients (79 men; 62.4 (55.0-72.7) years; 26.7 (24.9-30.3) kg/m(2)) undergoing coronary CTA were randomly assigned to a standard or an AI-based (human AI) coronary analysis group. Severity of coronary artery disease was graded according to CAD-RADS. Initial reports were reviewed and changes were classified. Both groups were similar with regard to age, sex, body mass index, heart rate, Agatston score, and CAD-RADS. The time for coronary CTA assessment (142.5 (106.5-215.0) s vs. 195.0 (146.0-265.5) s; p < 0.002) and the total reporting time (274.0 (208.0-377.0) s vs. 350 (264.0-445.5) s; p < 0.02) were lower in the human AI than in the standard group. The number of cases with no, minor, or CAD-RADS relevant changes did not differ significantly between groups (52, 7, 1 vs. 50, 8, 2; p = 0.80). AI-based analysis significantly improves clinical workflow, even in a specialized high-volume setting, by reducing CTA analysis and overall reporting time without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Author: ['Mladenovic R', 'Arsic Z', 'Velickovic S', 'Paunovic M']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: We present a very rare case of a child with nine supernumerary teeth to analyze the potential, benefits, and limitations of artificial intelligence, as well as two commercial tools for tooth segmentation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding applications in dentistry today, particularly in radiography. Special attention is given to models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and their application in automatic segmentation of the oral cavity and tooth structures. The integration of AI is gaining increasing attention, and the automation of the detection and localization of supernumerary teeth can accelerate the treatment planning process. Despite advancements in 3D segmentation techniques, relying on trained professionals remains crucial. Therefore, human expertise should remain key, and AI should be seen as a support rather than a replacement. Generally, a comprehensive tool that can satisfy all clinical needs in terms of supernumerary teeth and their segmentation is not yet available, so it is necessary to incorporate multiple tools into practice.

Abstract: Several artificial intelligence-based models have been presented for the detection of periodontal bone loss (PBL), mostly using convolutional neural networks, which are the state of the art in deep learning. Given the emerging breakthrough of transformer networks in computer vision, we aimed to evaluate various models for automatized PBL detection. An image data set of 21,819 anonymized periapical radiographs from the upper/lower and anterior/posterior regions was assessed by calibrated dentists according to PBL. Five vision transformer networks (ViT-base/ViT-large from Google, BEiT-base/BEiT-large from Microsoft, DeiT-base from Facebook/Meta) were utilized and evaluated. Accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were statistically determined. The overall diagnostic ACC and AUC values ranged from 83.4 to 85.2% and 0.899 to 0.918 for all evaluated transformer networks, respectively. Differences in diagnostic performance were evident for lower (ACC 94.1-96.7%; AUC 0.944-0.970) and upper anterior (86.7-90.2%; 0.948-0.958) and lower (85.6-87.2%; 0.913-0.937) and upper posterior teeth (78.1-81.0%; 0.851-0.875). In this study, only minor differences among the tested networks were detected for PBL detection. To increase the diagnostic performance and to support the clinical use of such networks, further optimisations with larger and manually annotated image data sets are needed.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Diagnostics in Medicine and Forensic Science.
Author: ['Lefevre T', 'Tournois L']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 28
Abstract: Diagnoses in forensic science cover many disciplinary and technical fields, including thanatology and clinical forensic medicine, as well as all the disciplines mobilized by these two major poles: criminalistics, ballistics, anthropology, entomology, genetics, etc. A diagnosis covers three major interrelated concepts: a categorization of pathologies (the diagnosis); a space of signs or symptoms; and the operation that makes it possible to match a set of signs to a category (the diagnostic approach). The generalization of digitization in all sectors of activity-including forensic science, the acculturation of our societies to data and digital devices, and the development of computing, storage, and data analysis capacities-constitutes a favorable context for the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can intervene in the three terms of diagnosis: in the space of pathological categories, in the space of signs, and finally in the operation of matching between the two spaces. Its intervention can take several forms: it can improve the performance (accuracy, reliability, robustness, speed, etc.) of the diagnostic approach, better define or separate known diagnostic categories, or better associate known signs. But it can also bring new elements, beyond the mere improvement of performance: AI takes advantage of any data (data here extending the concept of symptoms and classic signs, coming either from the five senses of the human observer, amplified or not by technical means, or from complementary examination tools, such as imaging). Through its ability to associate varied and large-volume data sources, but also its ability to uncover unsuspected associations, AI may redefine diagnostic categories, use new signs, and implement new diagnostic approaches. We present in this article how AI is already mobilized in forensic science, according to an approach that focuses primarily on improving current techniques. We also look at the issues related to its generalization, the obstacles to its development and adoption, and the risks related to the use of AI in forensic diagnostics.

Title: An Umbrella Review of the Fusion of fMRI and AI in Autism.
Author: ['Giansanti D']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 28
Abstract: The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is assuming an increasingly central role in autism diagnosis. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the realm of applications further contributes to its development. This study's objective is to analyze emerging themes in this domain through an umbrella review, encompassing systematic reviews. The research methodology was based on a structured process for conducting a literature narrative review, using an umbrella review in PubMed and Scopus. Rigorous criteria, a standard checklist, and a qualification process were meticulously applied. The findings include 20 systematic reviews that underscore key themes in autism research, particularly emphasizing the significance of technological integration, including the pivotal roles of fMRI and AI. This study also highlights the enigmatic role of oxytocin. While acknowledging the immense potential in this field, the outcome does not evade acknowledging the significant challenges and limitations. Intriguingly, there is a growing emphasis on research and innovation in AI, whereas aspects related to the integration of healthcare processes, such as regulation, acceptance, informed consent, and data security, receive comparatively less attention. Additionally, the integration of these findings into Personalized Medicine (PM) represents a promising yet relatively unexplored area within autism research. This study concludes by encouraging scholars to focus on the critical themes of health domain integration, vital for the routine implementation of these applications.
