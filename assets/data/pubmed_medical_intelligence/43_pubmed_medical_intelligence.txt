Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Disease diagnosis and monitoring using conventional healthcare services is typically expensive and has limited accuracy. Wearable health technology based on flexible electronics has gained tremendous attention in recent years for monitoring patient health owing to attractive features, such as lower medical costs, quick access to patient health data, ability to operate and transmit data in harsh environments, storage at room temperature, non-invasive implementation, mass scaling, etc. This technology provides an opportunity for disease pre-diagnosis and immediate therapy. Wearable sensors have opened a new area of personalized health monitoring by accurately measuring physical states and biochemical signals. Despite the progress to date in the development of wearable sensors, there are still several limitations in the accuracy of the data collected, precise disease diagnosis, and early treatment. This necessitates advances in applied materials and structures and using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wearable sensors to extract target signals for accurate clinical decision-making and efficient medical care. In this paper, we review two significant aspects of smart wearable sensors. First, we offer an overview of the most recent progress in improving wearable sensor performance for physical, chemical, and biosensors, focusing on materials, structural configurations, and transduction mechanisms. Next, we review the use of AI technology in combination with wearable technology for big data processing, self-learning, power-efficiency, real-time data acquisition and processing, and personalized health for an intelligent sensing platform. Finally, we present the challenges and future opportunities associated with smart wearable sensors.

Abstract: In recent years, more and more devices are connected to the network, generating an overwhelming amount of data. This term that is booming today is known as the Internet of Things. In order to deal with these data close to the source, the term Edge Computing arises. The main objective is to address the limitations of cloud processing and satisfy the growing demand for applications and services that require low latency, greater efficiency and real-time response capabilities. Furthermore, it is essential to underscore the intrinsic connection between artificial intelligence and edge computing within the context of our study. This integral relationship not only addresses the challenges posed by data proliferation but also propels a transformative wave of innovation, shaping a new era of data processing capabilities at the network's edge. Edge devices can perform real-time data analysis and make autonomous decisions without relying on constant connectivity to the cloud. This article aims at analysing and comparing Edge Computing devices when artificial intelligence algorithms are deployed on them. To this end, a detailed experiment involving various edge devices, models and metrics is conducted. In addition, we will observe how artificial intelligence accelerators such as Tensor Processing Unit behave. This analysis seeks to respond to the choice of a device that best suits the necessary AI requirements. As a summary, in general terms, the Jetson Nano provides the best performance when only CPU is used. Nevertheless the utilisation of a TPU drastically enhances the results.

Author: ['Wu Q', 'Geng Z', 'Ren Y', 'Feng Q', 'Zhong J']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 28
Abstract: Distributed artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied to multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs). This poses challenges to the distributed reconfiguration (DR) required for the optimal redeployment of multi-UAVs in the event of vehicle destruction. This paper presents a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based DR strategy (DRS) that optimizes the multi-UAV group redeployment in terms of swarm performance. To generate a two-layer DRS between multiple groups and a single group, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is developed in which a QMIX network determines the swarm redeployment, and each deep Q-network determines the single-group redeployment. The proposed method is simulated using Python and a case study demonstrates its effectiveness as a high-quality DRS for large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Service robots perform versatile functions in indoor environments. This study focuses on obstacle avoidance using flock-type indoor-based multi-robots. Each robot was developed with rendezvous behavior and distributed intelligence to perform obstacle avoidance. The hardware scheme-based obstacle-avoidance algorithm was developed using a bio-inspired flock approach, which was developed with three stages. Initially, the algorithm estimates polygonal obstacles and their orientations. The second stage involves performing avoidance at different orientations of obstacles using a heuristic based Bug2 algorithm. The final stage involves performing a flock rendezvous with distributed approaches and linear movements using a behavioral control mechanism. VLSI architectures were developed for multi-robot obstacle avoidance algorithms and were coded using Verilog HDL. The novel design of this article integrates the multi-robot's obstacle approaches with behavioral control and hardware scheme-based partial reconfiguration (PR) flow. The experiments were validated using FPGA-based multi-robots.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: In recent years, technological advancements in sensor, communication, and data storage technologies have led to the increasingly widespread use of smart devices in different types of buildings, such as residential homes, offices, and industrial installations. The main benefit of using these devices is the possibility of enhancing different crucial aspects of life within these buildings, including energy efficiency, safety, health, and occupant comfort. In particular, the fast progress in the field of the Internet of Things has yielded exponential growth in the number of connected smart devices and, consequently, increased the volume of data generated and exchanged. However, traditional Cloud-Computing platforms have exhibited limitations in their capacity to handle and process the continuous data exchange, leading to the rise of new computing paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing. In this new complex scenario, advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can play a key role in analyzing the generated data and predicting unexpected or anomalous events, allowing for quickly setting up effective responses against these unexpected events. To the best of our knowledge, current literature lacks Deep-Learning-based approaches specifically devised for guaranteeing safety in IoT-Based Smart Buildings. For this reason, we adopt an unsupervised neural architecture for detecting anomalies, such as faults, fires, theft attempts, and more, in such contexts. In more detail, in our proposal, data from a sensor network are processed by a Sparse U-Net neural model. The proposed approach is lightweight, making it suitable for deployment on the edge nodes of the network, and it does not require a pre-labeled training dataset. Experimental results conducted on a real-world case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed solution.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 21
Abstract: In this paper, the practical application of a bio-inspired antenna for partial discharge (PD) detection in high voltage equipment was evaluated in order to validate the efficiency of using this technology for PD monitoring purposes. For this, PD measurements using the bio-inspired antenna were performed on operational 69 kV potential transformers (PT) in a real substation. After the field experiment, laboratory measurements using the IEC 60270 standard method and a bio-inspired antenna were performed, simultaneously, over the evaluated PT. The results obtained at the substation indicated suspicious frequencies of partial discharge activity in two out of three evaluated potential transformers, mainly for the frequencies of 461 MHz, 1366 MHz, 1550 MHz and 1960 MHz. During the laboratory tests, the presence of partial discharge activity over the suspicious potential transformers was confirmed with the detection of PD apparent charge levels above 20 pC. Finally, the frequency spectrum obtained from the PD signals detected by the bio-inspired antenna in the laboratory presented similar frequency values to those obtained during the practical application at the substation, making it a promising indicator for future defect classification studies using artificial intelligence.

Journal Title: Cancers
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 2
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence to improve the access of cancer patients to high-quality medical care is one of the goals of modern medicine. Pathology constitutes the foundation of modern oncologic treatment, and its role has expanded far beyond diagnosis into predicting treatment response and overall survival. However, the funding of pathology is often an afterthought in resource-scarce medical systems. The increased digitalization of pathology has paved the way towards the potential use of artificial intelligence tools for improving pathologist efficiency and extracting more information from tissues. In this review, we provide an overview of the main research directions intersecting with artificial intelligence and pathology in relation to oncology, such as tumor classification, the prediction of molecular alterations, and biomarker quantification. We then discuss examples of tools that have matured into clinical products and gained regulatory approval for clinical use. Finally, we highlight the main hurdles that stand in the way of the digitalization of pathology and the application of artificial intelligence in pathology while also discussing possible solutions.

Title: DFCCNet: A Dense Flock of Chickens Counting Network Based on Density Map Regression.
Author: ['Lv J', 'Wang J', 'Peng C', 'Huang Q']
Journal Title: Animals : an open access journal from MDPI
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence, automatically and accurately counting chickens has become a reality. However, insufficient lighting, irregular sizes, and dense flocks make this a challenging task. The existing methods cannot perform accurate and stable counting. In this article, a dense flock of chickens counting network (DFCCNet) is proposed based on density map regression, where features from different levels are merged using feature fusion to obtain more information for distinguishing chickens from the background, resulting in more stable counting results. Multi-scaling is used to detect and count chickens at various scales, which can improve the counting accuracy and ensure stable performance for chickens of different sizes. Feature convolution kernels are adopted to convolve feature maps, which can extract more accurate target information, reduce the impact of occlusion, and achieve more reliable and precise results. A dataset of dense flocks of chickens (namely Dense-Chicken) has been collected and constructed, which contains 600 images of 99,916 chickens, with labeled points and boxes. It can be accessed by researchers as benchmark data. The proposed method was compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms, to validate its effectiveness. With its robustness being verified by counting in three kinds of density situations, with the mean absolute error being 4.26, 9.85, and 19.17, respectively, and a speed of 16.15 FPS. DFCCNet provides an automatic and fast approach to counting chickens in a dense farming environment. It can be easily embedded into handheld devices for application in agricultural engineering.

Abstract: As the number of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) examinations is expected to increase, technologies to optimize the imaging workflow are of great interest. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve clinical workflow and diagnostic accuracy in high-volume cardiac imaging centers. A total of 120 patients (79 men; 62.4 (55.0-72.7) years; 26.7 (24.9-30.3) kg/m(2)) undergoing coronary CTA were randomly assigned to a standard or an AI-based (human AI) coronary analysis group. Severity of coronary artery disease was graded according to CAD-RADS. Initial reports were reviewed and changes were classified. Both groups were similar with regard to age, sex, body mass index, heart rate, Agatston score, and CAD-RADS. The time for coronary CTA assessment (142.5 (106.5-215.0) s vs. 195.0 (146.0-265.5) s; p < 0.002) and the total reporting time (274.0 (208.0-377.0) s vs. 350 (264.0-445.5) s; p < 0.02) were lower in the human AI than in the standard group. The number of cases with no, minor, or CAD-RADS relevant changes did not differ significantly between groups (52, 7, 1 vs. 50, 8, 2; p = 0.80). AI-based analysis significantly improves clinical workflow, even in a specialized high-volume setting, by reducing CTA analysis and overall reporting time without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Author: ['Mladenovic R', 'Arsic Z', 'Velickovic S', 'Paunovic M']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: We present a very rare case of a child with nine supernumerary teeth to analyze the potential, benefits, and limitations of artificial intelligence, as well as two commercial tools for tooth segmentation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding applications in dentistry today, particularly in radiography. Special attention is given to models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and their application in automatic segmentation of the oral cavity and tooth structures. The integration of AI is gaining increasing attention, and the automation of the detection and localization of supernumerary teeth can accelerate the treatment planning process. Despite advancements in 3D segmentation techniques, relying on trained professionals remains crucial. Therefore, human expertise should remain key, and AI should be seen as a support rather than a replacement. Generally, a comprehensive tool that can satisfy all clinical needs in terms of supernumerary teeth and their segmentation is not yet available, so it is necessary to incorporate multiple tools into practice.

Abstract: Several artificial intelligence-based models have been presented for the detection of periodontal bone loss (PBL), mostly using convolutional neural networks, which are the state of the art in deep learning. Given the emerging breakthrough of transformer networks in computer vision, we aimed to evaluate various models for automatized PBL detection. An image data set of 21,819 anonymized periapical radiographs from the upper/lower and anterior/posterior regions was assessed by calibrated dentists according to PBL. Five vision transformer networks (ViT-base/ViT-large from Google, BEiT-base/BEiT-large from Microsoft, DeiT-base from Facebook/Meta) were utilized and evaluated. Accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were statistically determined. The overall diagnostic ACC and AUC values ranged from 83.4 to 85.2% and 0.899 to 0.918 for all evaluated transformer networks, respectively. Differences in diagnostic performance were evident for lower (ACC 94.1-96.7%; AUC 0.944-0.970) and upper anterior (86.7-90.2%; 0.948-0.958) and lower (85.6-87.2%; 0.913-0.937) and upper posterior teeth (78.1-81.0%; 0.851-0.875). In this study, only minor differences among the tested networks were detected for PBL detection. To increase the diagnostic performance and to support the clinical use of such networks, further optimisations with larger and manually annotated image data sets are needed.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Diagnostics in Medicine and Forensic Science.
Author: ['Lefevre T', 'Tournois L']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 28
Abstract: Diagnoses in forensic science cover many disciplinary and technical fields, including thanatology and clinical forensic medicine, as well as all the disciplines mobilized by these two major poles: criminalistics, ballistics, anthropology, entomology, genetics, etc. A diagnosis covers three major interrelated concepts: a categorization of pathologies (the diagnosis); a space of signs or symptoms; and the operation that makes it possible to match a set of signs to a category (the diagnostic approach). The generalization of digitization in all sectors of activity-including forensic science, the acculturation of our societies to data and digital devices, and the development of computing, storage, and data analysis capacities-constitutes a favorable context for the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can intervene in the three terms of diagnosis: in the space of pathological categories, in the space of signs, and finally in the operation of matching between the two spaces. Its intervention can take several forms: it can improve the performance (accuracy, reliability, robustness, speed, etc.) of the diagnostic approach, better define or separate known diagnostic categories, or better associate known signs. But it can also bring new elements, beyond the mere improvement of performance: AI takes advantage of any data (data here extending the concept of symptoms and classic signs, coming either from the five senses of the human observer, amplified or not by technical means, or from complementary examination tools, such as imaging). Through its ability to associate varied and large-volume data sources, but also its ability to uncover unsuspected associations, AI may redefine diagnostic categories, use new signs, and implement new diagnostic approaches. We present in this article how AI is already mobilized in forensic science, according to an approach that focuses primarily on improving current techniques. We also look at the issues related to its generalization, the obstacles to its development and adoption, and the risks related to the use of AI in forensic diagnostics.

Author: ['Giansanti D']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 28
Abstract: The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is assuming an increasingly central role in autism diagnosis. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the realm of applications further contributes to its development. This study's objective is to analyze emerging themes in this domain through an umbrella review, encompassing systematic reviews. The research methodology was based on a structured process for conducting a literature narrative review, using an umbrella review in PubMed and Scopus. Rigorous criteria, a standard checklist, and a qualification process were meticulously applied. The findings include 20 systematic reviews that underscore key themes in autism research, particularly emphasizing the significance of technological integration, including the pivotal roles of fMRI and AI. This study also highlights the enigmatic role of oxytocin. While acknowledging the immense potential in this field, the outcome does not evade acknowledging the significant challenges and limitations. Intriguingly, there is a growing emphasis on research and innovation in AI, whereas aspects related to the integration of healthcare processes, such as regulation, acceptance, informed consent, and data security, receive comparatively less attention. Additionally, the integration of these findings into Personalized Medicine (PM) represents a promising yet relatively unexplored area within autism research. This study concludes by encouraging scholars to focus on the critical themes of health domain integration, vital for the routine implementation of these applications.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe the evaluation of a variety of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound with different software, such as Cristal Vue, Realistic Vue, LumiFlow, and Spatiotemporal Image Correlation (STIC), with HDlive and HDlive Flow Silhouette modes. These technologies provide realistic images of the fetal heart and cardiac vessels using a fixed virtual light source that allows the operator to freely select a better light source position to enhance the cardiovascular anatomical details. In addition, Fetal Intelligent Navigation Echocardiography (FINE) technology, also known as "5D Heart" or "5D", is a technology that enables the automatic reconstruction of the nine standard fetal echocardiographic views and can alert non-specialists to suspected CHD. Through the use of artificial intelligence, an ultrasound machine is able to perform automatic anatomical and functional measurements. In addition, hese technologies enable the reconstruction of fetal cardiac structures in realistic images, improving the depth perception and resolution of anatomic cardiac details and blood vessels compared to those of standard two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex and debilitating illness with a significant global prevalence, affecting over 65 million individuals. It affects various systems, including the immune, neurological, gastrointestinal, and circulatory systems. Studies have shown abnormalities in immune cell types, increased inflammatory cytokines, and brain abnormalities. Further research is needed to identify consistent biomarkers and develop targeted therapies. This study uses explainable artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to identify discriminative metabolites for ME/CFS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The model investigates a metabolomics dataset of CFS patients and healthy controls, including 26 healthy controls and 26 ME/CFS patients aged 22-72. The dataset encapsulated 768 metabolites into nine metabolic super-pathways: amino acids, carbohydrates, cofactors, vitamins, energy, lipids, nucleotides, peptides, and xenobiotics. Random forest methods together with other classifiers were applied to the data to classify individuals as ME/CFS patients and healthy individuals. The classification learning algorithms' performance in the validation step was evaluated using a variety of methods, including the traditional hold-out validation method, as well as the more modern cross-validation and bootstrap methods. Explainable artificial intelligence approaches were applied to clinically explain the optimum model's prediction decisions. RESULTS: The metabolomics of C-glycosyltryptophan, oleoylcholine, cortisone, and 3-hydroxydecanoate were determined to be crucial for ME/CFS diagnosis. The random forest model outperformed the other classifiers in ME/CFS prediction using the 1000-iteration bootstrapping method, achieving 98% accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, 0.01 Brier score, and 99% AUC. According to the obtained results, the bootstrap validation approach demonstrated the highest classification outcomes. CONCLUSION: The proposed model accurately classifies ME/CFS patients based on the selected biomarker candidate metabolites. It offers a clear interpretation of risk estimation for ME/CFS, aiding physicians in comprehending the significance of key metabolomic features within the model.

Journal Title: American journal of medical genetics. Part A
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: PURPOSE: The precision medicine era has seen increased utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of genetics. We sought to explore the ways that genetic counselors (GCs) currently use the publicly accessible AI tool Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in their work. METHODS: GCs in North America were surveyed about how ChatGPT is used in different aspects of their work. Descriptive statistics were reported through frequencies and means. RESULTS: Of 118 GCs who completed the survey, 33.8% (40) reported using ChatGPT in their work; 47.5% (19) use it in clinical practice, 35% (14) use it in education, and 32.5% (13) use it in research. Most GCs (62.7%; 74) felt that it saves time on administrative tasks but the majority (82.2%; 97) felt that a paramount challenge was the risk of obtaining incorrect information. The majority of GCs not using ChatGPT (58.9%; 46) felt it was not necessary for their work. CONCLUSION: A considerable number of GCs in the field are using ChatGPT in different ways, but it is primarily helpful with tasks that involve writing. It has potential to streamline workflow issues encountered in clinical genetics, but practitioners need to be informed and uniformly trained about its limitations.

Title: Methods for using Bing's AI-powered search engine for data extraction for a systematic review.
Author: ['Hill JE', 'Harris C', 'Clegg A']
Journal Title: Research synthesis methods
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Data extraction is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task in the systematic review process. Natural language processing (NLP) artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to automate data extraction saving time and resources, accelerating the review process, and enhancing the quality and reliability of extracted data. In this paper, we propose a method for using Bing AI and Microsoft Edge as a second reviewer to verify and enhance data items first extracted by a single human reviewer. We describe a worked example of the steps involved in instructing the Bing AI Chat tool to extract study characteristics as data items from a PDF document into a table so that they can be compared with data extracted manually. We show that this technique may provide an additional verification process for data extraction where there are limited resources available or for novice reviewers. However, it should not be seen as a replacement to already established and validated double independent data extraction methods without further evaluation and verification. Use of AI techniques for data extraction in systematic reviews should be transparently and accurately described in reports. Future research should focus on the accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and user experience of using Bing AI for data extraction compared with traditional methods using two or more reviewers independently.
