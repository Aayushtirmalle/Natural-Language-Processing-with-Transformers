Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) use is now universal among nonexperts. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently employed by nonexperts in various imaging modalities to assist in diagnosis and decision making. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS, operated by medical students with the assistance of an AI-based tool for assessing the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of patients admitted to a cardiology department. METHODS: Eight students underwent a 6-hour didactic and hands-on training session. Participants used a hand-held ultrasound device (HUD) equipped with an AI-based tool for the automatic evaluation of LVEF. The clips were assessed for LVEF by three methods: visually by the students, by students + the AI-based tool, and by the cardiologists. All LVEF measurements were compared to formal echocardiography completed within 24 hours and were evaluated for LVEF using the Simpson method and eyeballing assessment by expert echocardiographers. RESULTS: The study included 88 patients (aged 58.3 +/- 16.3 years). The AI-based tool measurement was unsuccessful in 6 cases. Comparing LVEF reported by students' visual evaluation and students + AI vs. cardiologists revealed a correlation of 0.51 and 0.83, respectively. Comparing these three evaluation methods with the echocardiographers revealed a moderate/substantial agreement for the students + AI and cardiologists but only a fair agreement for the students' visual evaluation. CONCLUSION: Medical students' utilization of an AI-based tool with a HUD for LVEF assessment achieved a level of accuracy similar to that of cardiologists. Furthermore, the use of AI by the students achieved moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability with expert echocardiographers' evaluation.

Title: Skin Inclusion: Addressing Deficits in Medical Education to Promote Diversity in Dermatological Diagnosis and Treatment.
Author: ['Ongoro G', 'Avestruz Z', 'Stover S']
Journal Title: Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Dermatological conditions impact many people globally, including those with melanin-rich skin. However, insufficient medical education contributes to delayed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment for these conditions. This literature review aims to identify and address gaps in dermatological education for melanin skin. Current research reveals that medical school curricula inadequately cover these conditions, leading to low confidence among students in diagnosing and treating them. This educational deficiency results in healthcare disparities, as melanin skin patients experience inferior outcomes. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common due to the lack of training, particularly for conditions like keloids, vitiligo, and lupus erythematosus, which require a specialized understanding of melanin-rich skin. These errors can lead to suboptimal treatment, increased healthcare costs, and negative health outcomes. Additionally, limited representation of melanin skin in clinical studies hampers understanding and treatment options. To address these issues, it is recommended to enhance dermatological education on melanin skin in medical schools, utilize culturally responsive teaching methods, allocate research funds for melanin skin investigations, incorporate telemedicine and artificial intelligence, develop melanin-specific guidelines, and increase diversity in the healthcare workforce. Addressing these educational deficits is crucial for diverse and equitable dermatological care, improved healthcare outcomes, and reduced disparities for individuals with melanin-rich skin.

Title: Association of the Academic Performance of Undergraduate Medical Students With Positive Well-Being, Intelligence, and Factors of Academic Success.
Author: ['Agha S', 'Alzayed AA', 'Alfuraih TA', 'Alenazi FT', 'Alomair MI', 'Masuadi E']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The academic performance of medical students may affect their competence in future career prospects. Developing students' subjective well-being to improve academic performance is complex and has been investigated for many years. This cross-sectional study assessed the relationship between academic performance, general intelligence, and medical students' positive well-being. METHODS: This cross-sectional, internet-based survey included male and female medical students from pre-clinical and clinical years at one of the largest public-sector universities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between February 2020 and April 2020. The questionnaire included the World Health Organization-Five (WHO-5) Well-being Index, the Draw-A-Person Intellectual Ability (DAP: IQ) Test, and the Academic Success Inventory for College Students (ASICS). Academic performance was represented by a self-reported high-grade point average (GPA). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between academic performance and each of the well-being scores, intelligence, and academic success factors. Statistical significance was established at a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: Responses were received from 176 medical students. Most participants were males (93.8%). There was a significant association between GPA above 4.5 and the total WHO-5 well-being score (p = 0.013), the ASICS general skills (p = 0.007), perceiving instructor efficacy (p = 0.005), confidence (p < 0.001), personal adjustment (p = 0.023), and lack of anxiety (p = 0.006). No association was found between GPA and intelligence quotient (IQ) or well-being when other factors were adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Good academic performance is associated with subjective well-being and domains of academic success, such as perceived efficacy of the instructor, confidence, and personal adjustment. Implementing student development programs in medical schools can have a positive impact on students' academic performance and skills. Future studies assessing the different student support and development programs and their impact on academic success are needed.

Title: Understanding the black-box: towards interpretable and reliable deep learning models.
Author: ['Qamar T', 'Bawany NZ']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by providing sophisticated models across a diverse range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and autonomous driving. However, deep learning models are typically black-box models where the reason for predictions is unknown. Consequently, the reliability of the model becomes questionable in many circumstances. Explainable AI (XAI) plays an important role in improving the transparency and interpretability of the model thereby making it more reliable for real-time deployment. To investigate the reliability and truthfulness of DL models, this research develops image classification models using transfer learning mechanism and validates the results using XAI technique. Thus, the contribution of this research is twofold, we employ three pre-trained models VGG16, MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 using multiple transfer learning techniques for a fruit classification task consisting of 131 classes. Next, we inspect the reliability of models, based on these pre-trained networks, by utilizing Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, the LIME, a popular XAI technique that generates explanations for the predictions. Experimental results reveal that transfer learning provides optimized results of around 98% accuracy. The classification of the models is validated on different instances using LIME and it was observed that each model predictions are interpretable and understandable as they are based on pertinent image features that are relevant to particular classes. We believe that this research gives an insight for determining how an interpretation can be drawn from a complex AI model such that its accountability and trustworthiness can be increased.

Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, gives easy way for the analytical and physical tasks to be done automatically. There is a less necessity for human intervention while performing these tasks. Deep hybrid learning is a blended approach to combine machine learning with deep learning. A hybrid deep learning (HDL) model using convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet) and long short term memory (LSTM) is proposed for better course selection of the enrolled candidates in an online learning platform. In this work, a hybrid framework that facilitates the analysis and design of a recommendation system for course selection is developed. A student's schedule for the next course should consist of classes in which the student has shown interest. For universities to schedule classes optimally, they need to know what courses each student wants to take before each course begins. The proposed recommendation system selects the most appropriate course that can encourage students to base their selection on informed decision making. This system will enable learners to obtain the correct choices of courses to be studied.

Title: Location decision of low-altitude service station for transfer flight based on modified immune algorithm.
Author: ['Chen H', 'Yang W', 'Tang X', 'Yang M', 'Huang F', 'Zhu X']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The location of Low-Altitude Flight Service Station (LAFSS) is a comprehensive decision work, and it is also a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) with constraints. As a swarm intelligence search algorithm for solving constrained MOOP, the Immune Algorithm (IA) retains the excellent characteristics of genetic algorithm. Using some characteristic information or knowledge of the problem selectively and purposefully, the degradation phenomenon in the optimization process can be suppressed and the global optimum can be achieved. However, due to the large range involved in the low-altitude transition flight, the geographical characteristics, economic level and service requirements among the candidate stations in the corridor are quite different, and the operational safety and service efficiency are interrelated and conflict with each other. And all objectives cannot be optimal. Therefore, this article proposes a Modified Immune Algorithm (MIA) with two-layer response to solve the constrained multi-objective location mathematical model of LAFSS. The first layer uses the demand track as the cell membrane positioning pattern recognition service response distance to trigger the innate immunity to achieve the basic requirements of security service coverage. In the second layer, the expansion and upgrading of adjacent candidate sites are compared to the pathogen's effector, and the adaptive immunity is directly or indirectly triggered again through the cloning, mutation and reproduction between candidate sites to realize the multi-objective equilibrium of the scheme. Taking 486,000 km(2) of Sichuan Province as an example, MIA for LAFSS is simulated by the MATLAB platform. Based on the Spring open source application framework of Java platform, the cesiumjs map data is called through easyui, and the visualization of site selection scheme is presented with the terrain data of Map World as the background. The experimental results show that, compared with dynamic programming and ordinary immunization, the immune trigger mode of double response and the improved algorithm of operation parameter combination designed by the Taguchi experiment, the total economic cost of location selection is reduced by 26.4%, the service response time is reduced by 25%, the repeat coverage rate is reduced by 29.5% and the effective service area is increased by 17.5%. The security risk, service efficiency and location cost are balanced. The present work is to provide an effective location method for the layout number and location of local transfer flight service stations. For complex scenes with larger scale of low-altitude flight supply and demand and larger terrain changes in the region, the above research methods can be used to effectively split and reduce the dimension.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused millions of infections and deaths globally requiring effective solutions to fight the pandemic. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides data transmission without human intervention and thus mitigates infection chances. A road map is discussed in this study regarding the role of IoT applications to combat COVID-19. In addition, a real-time solution is provided to identify and monitor COVID-19 patients. The proposed framework comprises data collection using IoT-based devices, a health or quarantine center, a data warehouse for artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis, and healthcare professionals to provide treatment. The efficacy of several machine learning models is also analyzed for the prediction of the severity level of COVID-19 patients using real-time IoT data and a dataset named 'COVID Symptoms Checker'. The proposed ensemble model combines random forest and extra tree classifiers using a soft voting criterion and achieves superior results with a 0.922 accuracy score. The use of IoT applications is found to support medical professionals in investigating the features of the contagious disease and support managing the COVID pandemic more efficiently.

Title: The application of advanced computational algorithms used for cooperative communication transmission of vehicular networks: a proposed method.
Author: ['Cui X', 'Chen G']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Telematics will be one of the critical technologies in the future intelligent transportation system and establish communication between vehicles and vehicles, vehicles and networks, and vehicles and people. Thus, vehicles can sense mobile environments and make rational driving decisions. Therefore, the safety and efficiency of traffic flow would be enhanced. However, due to the unknown nature and higher complexity of the connected network environments of vehicles, the utilization of conventional optimization theory fails to generate satisfying results. To address the problem, this article proposes a methodology for collaborative transmission for communication regarding the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the help of advanced computational algorithms. The article employs a multi-intelligence advanced computational algorithm to construct a collaborative communication transmission mechanism in the telematics communication system model. The proposed algorithm fully considers the vehicle mobility and quality-of-service (QoS) of telematics services within the network slice. It adjusts the slice's radio resource allocation and parameter settings on an expanded time scale to improve the QoS of telematics services and increase the system's long-term revenue. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a more significant performance improvement than conventional algorithms using telematics information transmission. For example, when the same load conditions are under consideration, the total capacity of the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link optimized by the proposed algorithm is still higher than that of the other three baseline strategies.

Title: Challenges and opportunities for Arabic question-answering systems: current techniques and future directions.
Author: ['Alrayzah A', 'Alsolami F', 'Saleh M']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based question-answering (QA) systems can expedite the performance of various tasks. These systems either read passages and answer questions given in natural languages or if a question is given, they extract the most accurate answer from documents retrieved from the internet. Arabic is spoken by Arabs and Muslims and is located in the middle of the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to use natural language processing techniques to process modern Arabic owing to the language's complex morphology, orthographic ambiguity, regional variations in spoken Arabic, and limited linguistic and technological resources. Only a few Arabic QA experiments and systems have been designed on small datasets, some of which are yet to be made available. Although several reviews of Arabic QA studies have been conducted, the number of studies covered has been limited and recent trends have not been included. To the best of our knowledge, only two systematic reviews focused on Arabic QA have been published to date. One covered only 26 primary studies without considering recent techniques, while the other covered only nine studies conducted for Holy Qur'an QA systems. Here, the included studies were analyzed in terms of the datasets used, domains covered, types of Arabic questions asked, information retrieved, the mechanism used to extract answers, and the techniques used. Based on the results of the analysis, several limitations, concerns, and recommendations for future research were identified. Additionally, a novel taxonomy was developed to categorize the techniques used based on the domains and approaches of the QA system.

Title: A step toward building a unified framework for managing AI bias.
Author: ['Rana SA', 'Azizul ZH', 'Awan AA']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed living standards. However, AI's efforts are being thwarted by concerns about the rise of biases and unfairness. The problem advocates strongly for a strategy for tackling potential biases. This article thoroughly evaluates existing knowledge to enhance fairness management, which will serve as a foundation for creating a unified framework to address any bias and its subsequent mitigation method throughout the AI development pipeline. We map the software development life cycle (SDLC), machine learning life cycle (MLLC) and cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) together to have a general understanding of how phases in these development processes are related to each other. The map should benefit researchers from multiple technical backgrounds. Biases are categorised into three distinct classes; pre-existing, technical and emergent bias, and subsequently, three mitigation strategies; conceptual, empirical and technical, along with fairness management approaches; fairness sampling, learning and certification. The recommended practices for debias and overcoming challenges encountered further set directions for successfully establishing a unified framework.

Abstract: Network operations involve several decision-making tasks. Some of these tasks are related to operators, such as extending the footprint or upgrading the network capacity. Other decision tasks are related to network functions, such as traffic classifications, scheduling, capacity, coverage trade-offs, and policy enforcement. These decisions are often decentralized, and each network node makes its own decisions based on the preconfigured rules or policies. To ensure effectiveness, it is essential that planning and functional decisions are in harmony. However, human intervention-based decisions are subject to high costs, delays, and mistakes. On the other hand, machine learning has been used in different fields of life to automate decision processes intelligently. Similarly, future intelligent networks are also expected to see an intense use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for functional and operational automation. This article investigates the current state-of-the-art methods for packet scheduling and related decision processes. Furthermore, it proposes a machine learning-based approach for packet scheduling for agile and cost-effective networks to address various issues and challenges. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed deep learning-based approach can successfully address the challenges without compromising the network performance. For example, it has been seen that with mean absolute error from 6.38 to 8.41 using the proposed deep learning model, the packet scheduling can maintain 99.95% throughput, 99.97% delay, and 99.94% jitter, which are much better as compared to the statically configured traffic profiles.

Title: Adaptive tourism forecasting using hybrid artificial intelligence model: a case study of Xi'an international tourist arrivals.
Author: ['Zheng S', 'Zhang Z']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tourist demand is important to both business practitioners and government policymakers. In the past decade of rapid development of deep learning, many artificial intelligence methods or deep learning models have been built to improve prediction accuracy. But data-driven end-to-end deep network models usually require large data sets to support. For tourism forecasting, the sample is insufficient and many models are difficult to apply. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid model GM-LSTM, which combines the advantages of gray models and neural networks to achieve self-adaptive prediction with small samples. Specifically, the overall trend of tourism demand is captured by a first-order gray model and the non-linear residual fluctuation is characterized using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a rolling mechanism. The model is validated through a case study of up to 38 years of data on annual international tourist arrivals in Xi'an, China. The proposed GM-LSTM model achieved a predicted MAPE value of 11.88%, outperforming other time series models. The results indicate that our proposed hybrid model is accurate and efficient.

Journal Title: Frontiers in human neuroscience
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the SARA-CoV-2, characterized by high infectivity and incidence. Clinical data indicates that COVID-19 significantly damages patients' perception, motor function, and cognitive function. However, the electrophysiological mechanism by which the disease affects the patient's nervous system is not yet clear. Our aim is to investigate the abnormal levels of brain activity and changes in brain functional connectivity network in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We compared and analyzed electroencephalography signal sample entropy, energy spectrum, and brain network characteristic parameters in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) bands of 15 patients with COVID-19 and 15 healthy controls at rest. RESULTS: At rest, energy values of the four frequency bands in the frontal and temporal lobes of COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced. At the same time, the sample entropy value of the delta band in COVID-19 patients was significantly increased, while the value of the beta band was significantly decreased. However, the average value of the directed transfer function of patients did not show any abnormalities under the four frequency bands. Furthermore, node degree in the temporal lobe of patients was significantly increased, while the input degree of the frontal and temporal lobes was significantly decreased, and the output degree of the frontal and occipital lobes was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The level of brain activity in COVID-19 patients at rest is reduced, and the brain functional network undergoes a rearrangement. These results preliminarily demonstrate that COVID-19 patients exhibit certain brain abnormalities during rest, it is feasible to explore the neurophysiological mechanism of COVID-19's impact on the nervous system by using EEG signals, which can provide a certain technical basis for the subsequent diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 using artificial intelligence and the prevention of brain nervous system diseases after COVID-19 infection.

Title: Large-scale detection of marine debris in coastal areas with Sentinel-2.

Journal Title: iScience
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying marine pollution and macroplastics is an increasingly pressing ecological issue that directly impacts ecology and human health. Here, remote sensing can provide reliable estimates of plastic pollution by regularly monitoring and detecting marine debris in coastal areas. In this work, we present a detector for marine debris built on a deep segmentation model that outputs a probability for marine debris at the pixel level. We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets of marine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it is highly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marine debris. We integrate data-centric artificial intelligence principles by devising a training strategy with extensive sampling of negative examples and an automated label refinement of coarse hand labels. This yields a deep learning model that achieves higher accuracies on benchmark comparisons than existing detection models trained on previous datasets.

Abstract: Frozen embryo transfer (FET) is becoming popular in recent years. However, whether embryos freezing or other factors may affect intellectual performance in offspring is still unknown. We compared the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) questionnaire scores between children born after fresh embryo transfer (fresh ET) and FET. They were matched in a 1:1 ratio on their sex and age (+/-1 month). 326 children were included in each group. We found children born after FET scored lower on the WISC-IV questionnaire (p = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, the full-scale scores are similar between fresh ET and FET in the cleavage-stage transfer group (p = 0.57). In the FET group, the blastocyst-stage transfer group had lower full-scale scores compared with the cleavage-stage transfer group (p = 0.004). Children born after FET scored lower on WISC-IV questionnaire might be linked to extended culture of embryos rather than the freezing process.

Abstract: This paper reviews the key information and communication technologies that are necessary to build an effective industrial energy management system considering the intermittence of renewable sources like wind and solar (dagger). In particular, we first introduce the concept of software-defined energy networks in the context of industrial cyber-physical systems aiming at the optimal energy resource allocation in terms of its environmental impact. The task is formulated as a dynamic scheduling problem where supply and demand must match at minute-level timescale, also considering energy storage units. The use of (explainable and trustworthy) artificial intelligence (AI), (informative) networked data, demand-side management, machine-type (wireless) communications, and energy-aware scheduling in industrial plants are explored in detail. The paper also provides a framework for understanding the complexities of managing renewable energy sources in industrial plants while maintaining efficiency and environmental sustainability.

Abstract: To investigate whole-slide-level prediction in the field of artificial intelligence identification of dMMR/pMMR from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) in colorectal cancer (CRC), we established a segmentation-based dMMR/pMMR deep learning detector (SPEED). Our model was approximately 1,700 times faster than that of the classification-based model. For the internal validation cohort, our model yielded an overall AUC of 0.989. For the external validation cohort, the model exhibited a high performance, with an AUC of 0.865. The human‒machine strategy further improved the model performance for external validation by an AUC up to 0.988. Our whole-slide-level prediction model provided an approach for dMMR/pMMR detection from H&E whole slide images with excellent predictive performance and less computer processing time in patients with CRC.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized our understanding of macromolecular complexes, enabling high-resolution structure determination. With the paradigm shift to in situ structural biology recently driven by the ground-breaking development of cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography, there are an increasing number of structures at sub-nanometer resolution of complexes solved directly within their cellular environment. These cellular complexes often contain unidentified proteins, related to different cellular states or processes. Identifying proteins at resolutions lower than 4 A remains challenging because the side chains cannot be visualized reliably. Here, we present DomainFit, a program for automated domain-level protein identification from cryo-EM maps at resolutions lower than 4 A. By fitting domains from artificial intelligence-predicted models such as AlphaFold2-predicted models into cryo-EM maps, the program performs statistical analyses and attempts to identify the proteins forming the density. Using DomainFit, we identified two microtubule inner proteins, one of them, a CCDC81 domain-containing protein, is exclusively localized in the proximal region of the doublet microtubule from the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. The flexibility and capability of DomainFit makes it a valuable tool for analyzing in situ structures.

Abstract: Rare copy number variants (CNVs) and polygenic risk for intelligence (PRS-IQ) both confer risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but have opposing effects on cognitive ability. The field has struggled to disentangle the effects of these two classes of genomic variants on cognitive ability from their effects on ASD risk, in part because previous studies did not include controls with cognitive measures. We aim to investigate the impact of these genomic variants on ASD risk while adjusting for their known effects on cognitive ability. In a cohort of 8,426 subjects with ASD and 169,804 controls with cognitive assessments, we found that rare coding CNVs and PRS-IQ increased ASD risk, even after adjusting for their effects on cognitive ability. Bottom decile PRS-IQ and CNVs both decreased cognitive ability but had opposing effects on ASD risk. Models combining both classes of variants showed that the effects of rare CNVs and PRS-IQ on ASD risk and cognitive ability were largely additive, further suggesting that risk for ASD is conferred independently from its effects on cognitive ability. Despite imparting mostly additive effects on ASD risk, rare CNVs and PRS-IQ showed opposing effects on core and associated features and developmental history among subjects with ASD. Our findings suggest that cognitive ability itself may not be the factor driving the underlying risk for ASD conferred by these two classes of genomic variants. In other words, ASD risk and cognitive ability may be two distinct manifestations of CNVs and PRS-IQ. This study also highlights the challenge of understanding how genetic risk for ASD maps onto its dimensional traits.
