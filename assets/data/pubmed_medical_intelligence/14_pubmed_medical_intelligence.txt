Author: ['Indran IR', 'Paramanathan P', 'Gupta N', 'Mustafa N']
Journal Title: Medical teacher
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Crafting quality assessment questions in medical education is a crucial yet time-consuming, expertise-driven undertaking that calls for innovative solutions. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), present a promising yet underexplored avenue for such innovations. AIMS: This study explores the utility of ChatGPT to generate diverse, high-quality medical questions, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as an illustrative example, to increase educator's productivity and enable self-directed learning for students. DESCRIPTION: Leveraging 12 strategies, we demonstrate how ChatGPT can be effectively used to generate assessment questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy and core knowledge domains while promoting best practices in assessment design. CONCLUSION: Integrating LLM tools like ChatGPT into generating medical assessment questions like MCQs augments but does not replace human expertise. With continual instruction refinement, AI can produce high-standard questions. Yet, the onus of ensuring ultimate quality and accuracy remains with subject matter experts, affirming the irreplaceable value of human involvement in the artificial intelligence-driven education paradigm.

Journal Title: Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obesity is a known cardiovascular risk factor and associated with higher postoperative complication rates in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In heart failure (HF), conflicting evidence in terms of survival has been reported, whereas sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis. An increasing number of HF patients require left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantations. The postoperative mortality has improved in recent years but is still relatively high. The impact of body composition on outcome in this population remains unclear. The aim of this investigation was to examine the preoperative computed tomography (CT) body composition as a predictor of the postoperative outcome in advanced HF patients, who receive LVAD implantations. METHODS: Preoperative CT scans of 137 patients who received LVADs between 2015 and 2020 were retrospectively analysed using an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered automated software tool based on a convolutional neural network, U-net, developed for image segmentation (Visage Version 7.1, Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Assessment of body composition included visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas (VAT and SAT), psoas and total abdominal muscle areas and sarcopenia (defined by lumbar skeletal muscle indexes). The body composition parameters were correlated with postoperative major complication rates, survival and postoperative 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 58.21 +/- 11.9 years; 122 (89.1%) were male. Most patients had severe HF requiring inotropes (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support [INTERMACS] profile I-III, 71.9%) secondary to coronary artery diseases or dilated cardiomyopathy (96.4%). Forty-four (32.1%) patients were obese (body mass index >/= 30 kg/m(2) ), 96 (70.1%) were sarcopene and 19 (13.9%) were sarcopene obese. Adipose tissue was associated with a significantly higher risk of postoperative infections (VAT 172.23 cm(2) [54.96, 288.32 cm(2) ] vs. 124.04 cm(2) [56.57, 186.25 cm(2) ], P = 0.022) and in-hospital mortality (VAT 168.11 cm(2) [134.19, 285.27 cm(2) ] vs. 135.42 cm(2) [49.44, 227.91 cm(2) ], P = 0.033; SAT 227.28 cm(2) [139.38, 304.35 cm(2) ] vs. 173.81 cm(2) [97.65, 254.16 cm(2) ], P = 0.009). Obese patients showed no improvement of 6MWD and QoL within 6 months postoperatively (obese: +0.94 +/- 161.44 months, P = 0.982; non-obese: +166.90 +/- 139.00 months, P < 0.000; obese: +0.088 +/- 0.421, P = 0.376; non-obese: +0.199 +/- 0.324, P = 0.002, respectively). Sarcopenia did not influence the postoperative outcome and survival within 1 year after LVAD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative AI-based CT body composition identifies patients with poor outcome after LVAD implantation. Greater adipose tissue areas are associated with an increased risk for postoperative infections, in-hospital mortality and impaired 6MWD and QoL within 6 months postoperatively.

Title: Preterm Birth: Screening and Prediction.
Author: ['Creswell L', 'Rolnik DL', 'Lindow SW', "O'Gorman N"]
Journal Title: International journal of women's health
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB) affects approximately 10% of births globally each year and is the most significant direct cause of neonatal death and of long-term disability worldwide. Early identification of women at high risk of PTB is important, given the availability of evidence-based, effective screening modalities, which facilitate decision-making on preventative strategies, particularly transvaginal sonographic cervical length (CL) measurement. There is growing evidence that combining CL with quantitative fetal fibronectin (qfFN) and maternal risk factors in the extensively peer-reviewed and validated QUanititative Innovation in Predicting Preterm birth (QUiPP) application can aid both the triage of patients who present as emergencies with symptoms of preterm labor and high-risk asymptomatic women attending PTB surveillance clinics. The QUiPP app risk of delivery thus supports shared decision-making with patients on the need for increased outpatient surveillance, in-patient treatment for preterm labor or simply reassurance for those unlikely to deliver preterm. Effective triage of patients at preterm gestations is an obstetric clinical priority as correctly timed administration of antenatal corticosteroids will maximise their neonatal benefits. This review explores the predictive capacity of existing predictive tests for PTB in both singleton and multiple pregnancies, including the QUiPP app v.2. and discusses promising new research areas, which aim to predict PTB through cervical stiffness and elastography measurements, metabolomics, extracellular vesicles and artificial intelligence.

Title: Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Drinking Water: A Narrative Review.
Author: ['Maroju RG', 'Choudhari SG', 'Shaikh MK', 'Borkar SK', 'Mendhe H']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Waterborne illnesses are a significant concern worldwide. The management of water resources can be facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) with the help of data analytics, regression models, and algorithms. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations depends on understanding, communicating, and measuring the value of water and incorporating it into decision-making. Various barriers are used from the source to the consumer to prevent microbiological contamination of drinking water sources or reduce contamination to levels safe for human health. Infrastructure development and capacity-building policies should be integrated with guidelines on applying AI to problems relating to water to ensure good development outcomes. Communities can live healthily with such technology if they can provide clean, economical, and sustainable water to the ecosystem as a whole. Quick and accurate identification of waterborne pathogens in drinking and recreational water sources is essential for treating and controlling the spread of water-related diseases, especially in resource-constrained situations. To ensure successful development outcomes, policies on infrastructure development and capacity building should be combined with those on applying AI to water-related problems. The primary focus of this study is the use of AI in managing drinking water and preventing waterborne illness.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: Chronic wounds contribute to significant healthcare and economic burden worldwide. Wound assessment remains challenging given its complex and dynamic nature. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods in wound analysis is promising. Explainable modelling can help its integration and acceptance in healthcare systems. We aim to develop an explainable AI model for analysing vascular wound images among an Asian population. Two thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven wound images from a vascular wound image registry from a tertiary institution in Singapore were utilized. The dataset was split into training, validation and test sets. Wound images were classified into four types (neuroischaemic ulcer [NIU], surgical site infections [SSI], venous leg ulcers [VLU], pressure ulcer [PU]), measured with automatic estimation of width, length and depth and segmented into 18 wound and peri-wound features. Data pre-processing was performed using oversampling and augmentation techniques. Convolutional and deep learning models were utilized for model development. The model was evaluated with accuracy, F1 score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Explainability methods were used to interpret AI decision reasoning. A web browser application was developed to demonstrate results of the wound AI model with explainability. After development, the model was tested on additional 15 476 unlabelled images to evaluate effectiveness. After the development on the training and validation dataset, the model performance on unseen labelled images in the test set achieved an AUROC of 0.99 for wound classification with mean accuracy of 95.9%. For wound measurements, the model achieved AUROC of 0.97 with mean accuracy of 85.0% for depth classification, and AUROC of 0.92 with mean accuracy of 87.1% for width and length determination. For wound segmentation, an AUROC of 0.95 and mean accuracy of 87.8% was achieved. Testing on unlabelled images, the model confidence score for wound classification was 82.8% with an explainability score of 60.6%. Confidence score was 87.6% for depth classification with 68.0% explainability score, while width and length measurement obtained 93.0% accuracy score with 76.6% explainability. Confidence score for wound segmentation was 83.9%, while explainability was 72.1%. Using explainable AI models, we have developed an algorithm and application for analysis of vascular wound images from an Asian population with accuracy and explainability. With further development, it can be utilized as a clinical decision support system and integrated into existing healthcare electronic systems.

Title: Understanding progression from pre-school wheezing to school-age asthma: Can modern data approaches help?
Author: ['Custovic D', 'Fontanella S', 'Custovic A']
Journal Title: Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Preschool wheezing and childhood asthma create a heavy disease burden which is only exacerbated by the complexity of the conditions. Preschool wheezing exhibits both "curricular" and "aetiological" heterogeneity: that is, heterogeneity across patients both in the time-course of its development and in its underpinning pathological mechanisms. Since these are not fully understood, but clinical presentations across patients may nonetheless be similar, current diagnostic labels are imprecise-not mapping cleanly onto underlying disease mechanisms-and prognoses uncertain. These uncertainties also make a identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention difficult. In the past few decades, carefully designed birth cohort studies have collected "big data" on a large scale, incorporating not only a wealth of longitudinal clinical data, but also detailed information from modalities as varied as imaging, multiomics, and blood biomarkers. The profusion of big data has seen the proliferation of what we term "modern data approaches" (MDAs)-grouping together machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science-to make sense and make use of this data. In this review, we survey applications of MDAs (with an emphasis on machine learning) in childhood wheeze and asthma, highlighting the extent of their successes in providing tools for prognosis, unpicking the curricular heterogeneity of these conditions, clarifying the limitations of current diagnostic criteria, and indicating directions of research for uncovering the etiology of the diseases underlying these conditions. Specifically, we focus on the trajectories of childhood wheeze phenotypes. Further, we provide an explainer of the nature and potential use of MDAs and emphasize the scope of what we can hope to achieve with them.

Author: ['Bartholomew RE', 'Baloh RW']
Journal Title: The International journal of social psychiatry
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since 2016, an array of claims and public discourse have circulated in the medical community over the origin and nature of a mysterious condition dubbed "Havana Syndrome," so named as it was first identified in Cuba. In March 2023, the United States intelligence community concluded that the condition was a socially constructed catch-all category for an array of health conditions and stress reactions that were lumped under a single label. AIMS: To examine the history of "Havana Syndrome" and the many factors that led to its erroneous categorization as a novel clinical entity. METHOD: A review of the literature. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Several factors led to the erroneous classification of "Havana Syndrome" as a novel entity including the failure to stay within the limitations of the data; the withholding of information by intelligence agencies, the prevalence of popular misconceptions about psychogenic illness, the inability to identify historical parallels; the role of the media, and the mixing of politics with science.

Author: ['Jia Y', 'Liu J', 'Chen L', 'Zhao T', 'Wang Y']
Journal Title: Briefings in bioinformatics
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics unveils the complex dynamics of cell regulation and transcriptomes, but it is typically cost-prohibitive. Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images via artificial intelligence offers a more affordable option, yet existing methods fall short in extracting deep-level information from pathological images. In this paper, we present THItoGene, a hybrid neural network that utilizes dynamic convolutional and capsule networks to adaptively sense potential molecular signals in histological images for exploring the relationship between high-resolution pathology image phenotypes and regulation of gene expression. A comprehensive benchmark evaluation using datasets from human breast cancer and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has demonstrated the superior performance of THItoGene in spatial gene expression prediction. Moreover, THItoGene has demonstrated its capacity to decipher both the spatial context and enrichment signals within specific tissue regions.

Title: Darwinian evolution has become dogma; AI can rescue what is salvageable.
Author: ['Brown OR', 'Hullender DA']
Journal Title: Progress in biophysics and molecular biology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 23
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), as an academic discipline, is traceable to the mid-1950s but it is currently exploding in applications with successes and concerns. AI can be defined as intelligence demonstrated by computers, with intelligence difficult to define but it must include concepts of ability to learn, reason, and generalize from a vast amount of information and, we propose, to infer meaning. The type of AI known as general AI, has strong, but unrealized potential both for assessing and also for solving major problems with the scientific theory of Darwinian evolution, including its modern variants and for origin of life studies. Specifically, AI should be applied first to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the assumptions and empirical information underpinning theories of the origin of life and probability of its evolution. AI should then be applied to assess the scientific validity of the theory of how abundant life came to be on earth.

Title: EaLDL: Element-Aware Lifelong Dictionary Learning for Multimode Process Monitoring.
Author: ['Huang K', 'Zhu H', 'Wu D', 'Yang C', 'Gui W']
Journal Title: IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern industry and the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence, data-driven process monitoring methods have gained significant popularity in industrial systems. Traditional static monitoring models struggle to represent the new modes that arise in industrial production processes due to changes in production environments and operating conditions. Retraining these models to address the changes often leads to high computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a multimode process monitoring method based on element-aware lifelong dictionary learning (EaLDL). This method initially treats dictionary elements as fundamental units and measures the global importance of dictionary elements from the perspective of the multimode global learning process. Subsequently, to ensure that the dictionary can represent new modes without losing the representation capability of historical modes during the updating process, we construct a novel surrogate loss to impose constraints on the update of dictionary elements. This constraint enables the continuous updating of the dictionary learning (DL) method to accommodate new modes without compromising the representation of previous modes. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform comprehensive experiments on numerical simulations as well as an industrial process. A comparison is made with several advanced process monitoring methods to assess its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a favorable balance between learning new modes and retaining the memory of historical modes. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits insensitivity to initial points, delivering satisfactory results under various initial conditions.

Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: BACKGROUND: ChatGPT may act as a research assistant to help organize the direction of thinking and summarize research findings. However, few studies have examined the quality, similarity (abstracts being similar to the original one), and accuracy of the abstracts generated by ChatGPT when researchers provide full-text basic research papers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the applicability of an artificial intelligence (AI) model in generating abstracts for basic preclinical research. METHODS: We selected 30 basic research papers from Nature, Genome Biology, and Biological Psychiatry. Excluding abstracts, we inputted the full text into ChatPDF, an application of a language model based on ChatGPT, and we prompted it to generate abstracts with the same style as used in the original papers. A total of 8 experts were invited to evaluate the quality of these abstracts (based on a Likert scale of 0-10) and identify which abstracts were generated by ChatPDF, using a blind approach. These abstracts were also evaluated for their similarity to the original abstracts and the accuracy of the AI content. RESULTS: The quality of ChatGPT-generated abstracts was lower than that of the actual abstracts (10-point Likert scale: mean 4.72, SD 2.09 vs mean 8.09, SD 1.03; P<.001). The difference in quality was significant in the unstructured format (mean difference -4.33; 95% CI -4.79 to -3.86; P<.001) but minimal in the 4-subheading structured format (mean difference -2.33; 95% CI -2.79 to -1.86). Among the 30 ChatGPT-generated abstracts, 3 showed wrong conclusions, and 10 were identified as AI content. The mean percentage of similarity between the original and the generated abstracts was not high (2.10%-4.40%). The blinded reviewers achieved a 93% (224/240) accuracy rate in guessing which abstracts were written using ChatGPT. CONCLUSIONS: Using ChatGPT to generate a scientific abstract may not lead to issues of similarity when using real full texts written by humans. However, the quality of the ChatGPT-generated abstracts was suboptimal, and their accuracy was not 100%.

Title: Designing Human-Centered AI to Prevent Medication Dispensing Errors: Focus Group Study With Pharmacists.
Author: ['Zheng Y', 'Rowell B', 'Chen Q', 'Kim JY', 'Kontar RA', 'Yang XJ', 'Lester CA']
Journal Title: JMIR formative research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medication errors, including dispensing errors, represent a substantial worldwide health risk with significant implications in terms of morbidity, mortality, and financial costs. Although pharmacists use methods like barcode scanning and double-checking for dispensing verification, these measures exhibit limitations. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacy verification emerges as a potential solution, offering precision, rapid data analysis, and the ability to recognize medications through computer vision. For AI to be embraced, it must be designed with the end user in mind, fostering trust, clear communication, and seamless collaboration between AI and pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gather pharmacists' feedback in a focus group setting to help inform the initial design of the user interface and iterative designs of the AI prototype. METHODS: A multidisciplinary research team engaged pharmacists in a 3-stage process to develop a human-centered AI system for medication dispensing verification. To design the AI model, we used a Bayesian neural network that predicts the dispensed pills' National Drug Code (NDC). Discussion scripts regarding how to design the system and feedback in focus groups were collected through audio recordings and professionally transcribed, followed by a content analysis guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety and Human-Machine Teaming theoretical frameworks. RESULTS: A total of 8 pharmacists participated in 3 rounds of focus groups to identify current challenges in medication dispensing verification, brainstorm solutions, and provide feedback on our AI prototype. Participants considered several teaming scenarios, generally favoring a hybrid teaming model where the AI assists in the verification process and a pharmacist intervenes based on medication risk level and the AI's confidence level. Pharmacists highlighted the need for improving the interpretability of AI systems, such as adding stepwise checkmarks, probability scores, and details about drugs the AI model frequently confuses with the target drug. Pharmacists emphasized the need for simplicity and accessibility. They favored displaying only essential information to prevent overwhelming users with excessive data. Specific design features, such as juxtaposing pill images with their packaging for quick comparisons, were requested. Pharmacists preferred accept, reject, or unsure options. The final prototype interface included (1) checkmarks to compare pill characteristics between the AI-predicted NDC and the prescription's expected NDC, (2) a histogram showing predicted probabilities for the AI-identified NDC, (3) an image of an AI-provided "confused" pill, and (4) an NDC match status (ie, match, unmatched, or unsure). CONCLUSIONS: In partnership with pharmacists, we developed a human-centered AI prototype designed to enhance AI interpretability and foster trust. This initiative emphasized human-machine collaboration and positioned AI as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement. This study highlights the process of designing a human-centered AI for dispensing verification, emphasizing its interpretability, confidence visualization, and collaborative human-machine teaming styles.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The rapid trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) development and advancement is quickly outpacing society's ability to determine its future role. As AI continues to transform various aspects of our lives, one critical question arises for medical education: what will be the nature of education, teaching, and learning in a future world where the acquisition, retention, and application of knowledge in the traditional sense are fundamentally altered by AI? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this perspective is to plan for the intersection of health care and medical education in the future. METHODS: We used GPT-4 and scenario-based strategic planning techniques to craft 4 hypothetical future worlds influenced by AI's integration into health care and medical education. This method, used by organizations such as Shell and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, assesses readiness for alternative futures and effectively manages uncertainty, risk, and opportunity. The detailed scenarios provide insights into potential environments the medical profession may face and lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and idea-building regarding responsible AI implementation. RESULTS: The following 4 worlds were created using OpenAI's GPT model: AI Harmony, AI conflict, The world of Ecological Balance, and Existential Risk. Risks include disinformation and misinformation, loss of privacy, widening inequity, erosion of human autonomy, and ethical dilemmas. Benefits involve improved efficiency, personalized interventions, enhanced collaboration, early detection, and accelerated research. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure responsible AI use, the authors suggest focusing on 3 key areas: developing a robust ethical framework, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and investing in education and training. A strong ethical framework emphasizes patient safety, privacy, and autonomy while promoting equity and inclusivity. Interdisciplinary collaboration encourages cooperation among various experts in developing and implementing AI technologies, ensuring that they address the complex needs and challenges in health care and medical education. Investing in education and training prepares professionals and trainees with necessary skills and knowledge to effectively use and critically evaluate AI technologies. The integration of AI in health care and medical education presents a critical juncture between transformative advancements and significant risks. By working together to address both immediate and long-term risks and consequences, we can ensure that AI integration leads to a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for both health care and medical education. As we engage with AI technologies, our collective actions will ultimately determine the state of the future of health care and medical education to harness AI's power while ensuring the safety and well-being of humanity.

Journal Title: Expert opinion on drug discovery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: With the increasing incidence and prevalence of neurological disorders globally, there is a paramount need for new pharmacotherapies. BBB effectively protects the brain but raises a profound challenge to drug permeation, with less than 2% of most drugs reaching the CNS. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews aspects of the most recent design strategies, providing insights into ideas and concepts in CNS drug discovery. An overview of the products available on the market is given and why clinical trials are continuously failing is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Among the available CNS drugs, small molecules account for most successful CNS therapeutics due to their ability to penetrate the BBB through passive or carrier-mediated mechanisms. The development of new CNS drugs is very difficult. To date, there is a lack of effective drugs for alleviating or even reversing the progression of brain diseases. Particularly, the use of artificial intelligence strategies, together with more appropriate animal models, may enable the design of molecules with appropriate permeation, to elicit a biological response from the neurotherapeutic target.

Author: ['Mese I', 'Altintas Taslicay C', 'Kuzan BN', 'Kuzan TY', 'Sivrioglu AK']
Journal Title: Diagnostic and interventional radiology (Ankara, Turkey)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: Rapid technological advances have transformed medical education, particularly in radiology, which depends on advanced imaging and visual data. Traditional electronic learning (e-learning) platforms have long served as a cornerstone in radiology education, offering rich visual content, interactive sessions, and peer-reviewed materials. They excel in teaching intricate concepts and techniques that necessitate visual aids, such as image interpretation and procedural demonstrations. However, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language model, has made its mark in radiology education. It can generate learning assessments, create lesson plans, act as a round-the-clock virtual tutor, enhance critical thinking, translate materials for broader accessibility, summarize vast amounts of information, and provide real-time feedback for any subject, including radiology. Concerns have arisen regarding ChatGPT's data accuracy, currency, and potential biases, especially in specialized fields such as radiology. However, the quality, accessibility, and currency of e-learning content can also be imperfect. To enhance the educational journey for radiology residents, the integration of ChatGPT with expert-curated e-learning resources is imperative for ensuring accuracy and reliability and addressing ethical concerns. While AI is unlikely to entirely supplant traditional radiology study methods, the synergistic combination of AI with traditional e-learning can create a holistic educational experience.

Abstract: To efficiently process the massive amount of sensor data, it is demanding to develop a new paradigm. Inspired by neurobiological systems, an infrared near-senor reservoir computing (RC) system, consisting of infrared sensors and memristors based on single-crystalline LiTaO(3) and LiNbO(3) (LN) thin film respectively, is demonstrated. The analog memristor is used as a reservoir in the RC system to process sensor signals with spatiotemporal characteristics. LN crystal structure stacked with oxygen octahedra provides favorable conditions for reliable Mott variable-range hopping conduction, which provides the memristor with tens of thousands of reservoir states within a large dynamic range. With the characteristics, the analog sensor signals with high data fidelity can be directly fed to the memristive reservoir, and the spatiotemporal features can be separated and mapped. The system demonstrated a dynamic gesture perception task, achieving an accuracy of 99.6%, which highlights the great application potential of the memristor in signal sensor processing and will advance the application of artificial intelligence in sensor systems. Crystal ion slicing techniques are used to fabricate a single-crystalline thin film for both the memristor and sensor, which opens up the possibility of realizing monolithic integration of a memristor-based near-sensor computing system.

Abstract: The study of biological materials and bio-inspired materials science is well established; however, surprisingly little knowledge is systematically translated to engineering solutions. To accelerate discovery and guide insights, an open-source autoregressive transformer large language model (LLM), BioinspiredLLM, is reported. The model is finetuned with a corpus of over a thousand peer-reviewed articles in the field of structural biological and bio-inspired materials and can be prompted to recall information, assist with research tasks, and function as an engine for creativity. The model has proven that it is able to accurately recall information about biological materials and is further strengthened with enhanced reasoning ability, as well as with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate new data during generation that can also help to traceback sources, update the knowledge base, and connect knowledge domains. BioinspiredLLM also has shown to develop sound hypotheses regarding biological materials design and remarkably so for materials that have never been explicitly studied before. Lastly, the model shows impressive promise in collaborating with other generative artificial intelligence models in a workflow that can reshape the traditional materials design process. This collaborative generative artificial intelligence method can stimulate and enhance bio-inspired materials design workflows. Biological materials are at a critical intersection of multiple scientific fields and models like BioinspiredLLM help to connect knowledge domains.
