Abstract: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant used after pediatric liver transplant. However, tacrolimus's narrow therapeutic window, reliance on physicians' experience for the dose titration, and intra- and inter-patient variability result in liver transplant patients falling out of the target tacrolimus trough levels frequently. Existing personalized dosing models based on the area-under-the-concentration over time curves require a higher frequency of blood draws than the current standard of care and may not be practically feasible. We present a small-data artificial intelligence-derived platform, CURATE.AI, that uses data from individual patients obtained once daily to model the dose and response relationship and identify suitable doses dynamically. Retrospective optimization using 6 models of CURATE.AI and data from 16 patients demonstrated good predictive performance and identified a suitable model for further investigations.Clinical Relevance- This study established and compared the predictive performance of 6 personalized tacrolimus dosing models for pediatric liver transplant patients and identified a suitable model with consistently good predictive performance based on data from pediatric liver transplant patients.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images - due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms' accuracy and validate their robustness.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers in men. Early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in reducing the mortality rate from clinically significant PCa (csPCa). In recent years, bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) has attracted great attention for the detection and diagnosis of csPCa. bpMRI is able to overcome some limitations of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) such as the use of contrast agents, the time-consuming for imaging and the costs, and achieve detection performance comparable to mpMRI. However, inter-reader agreements are currently low for prostate MRI. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the development of deep learning (DL)-based computer-aided detection and diagnosis system (CAD). However, most of the existing DL models developed for csPCa identification are restricted by the scale of data and the scarcity in labels. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised pre-training scheme named SSPT-bpMRI with an image restoration pretext task integrating four different image transformations to improve the performance of DL algorithms. Specially, we explored the potential value of the self-supervised pre-training in fully supervised and weakly supervised situations. Experiments on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the fully supervised or weakly supervised model alone.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a global public health concern. For women with suspicious breast lesions, the current diagnosis requires a biopsy, which is usually guided by ultrasound (US). However, this process is challenging due to the low quality of the US image and the complexity of dealing with the US probe and the surgical needle simultaneously, making it largely reliant on the surgeon's expertise. Some previous works employing collaborative robots emerged to improve the precision of biopsy interventions, providing an easier, safer, and more ergonomic procedure. However, for these equipment to be able to navigate around the breast autonomously, 3D breast reconstruction needs to be available. The accuracy of these systems still needs to improve, with the 3D reconstruction of the breast being one of the biggest focuses of errors. The main objective of this work is to develop a method to obtain a robust 3D reconstruction of the patient's breast, based on RGB monocular images, which later can be used to compute the robot's trajectories for the biopsy. To this end, depth estimation techniques will be developed, based on a deep learning architecture constituted by a CNN, LSTM, and MLP, to generate depth maps capable of being converted into point clouds. After merging several from multiple points of view, it is possible to generate a real-time reconstruction of the breast as a mesh. The development and validation of our method was performed using a previously described synthetic dataset. Hence, this procedure takes RGB images and the cameras' position and outputs the breasts' meshes. It has a mean error of 3.9 mm and a standard deviation of 1.2 mm. The final results attest to the ability of this methodology to predict the breast's shape and size using monocular images.Clinical Relevance- This work proposes a method based on artificial intelligence and monocular RGB images to obtain the breast's volume during robotic guided breast biopsies, improving their execution and safety.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently gained a lot of attention, as it can provide additional emotion cues that can be correlated with human social behavior. An extension towards an AI-based emotional climate (EC) recognition, i.e., the recognition of the joint emotional atmosphere dynamically created and perceived by the peers throughout a conversation, is proposed here. In our approach, namely MLBispeC (Machine Learning Based Bispectral Classification), the peers' speech signals during their conversation are subjected to time-windowed bispectral analysis, allowing for feature extraction related to dynamic harmonics nonlinear interactions. In addition, peers' affect dynamics, derived from their same time-windowed emotion labeling, are combined to form an extended feature vector, inputted into two well-known machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor). MLBispeC was evaluated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) open access dataset, which contains 2D emotions, i.e., Arousal (A) and valence (V) that are divided into (low/high) classes. The experimental results have shown that MLBispeC outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an accuracy of 0.826A/0.754V, sensitivity of 0.864A/0.774V, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.821A/0.799V. This demonstrates the effectiveness of MLBispeC to objectively recognize peers' EC during their conversation, allowing for insights into their emotional and social interactions.Clinical relevance-Unobtrusive, objective and dynamic recognition of the EC built during peers' conversation can scaffold effective assessment of patients with physiological, psychological, and mental diseases, at various age ranges (children, adults, and older adults).

Abstract: Drifted by the hype of new and efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence models aiming to unlock the information wealth hidden inside heterogeneous datasets across different markets and disciplines, healthcare data are in the center of novel technological advancements in predictive health diagnostics, remote healthcare, assistive leaving and wellbeing. Nevertheless, this emerging market has underlined the necessity of developing new methods and updating existing ones for preserving the privacy of the data and their owners, as well as, ensuring confidentiality and trust throughout the health care data processing pipelines. This paper presents one of the key innovations of a Horizon Europe funded project named "TRUSTEE", which focuses on building a trust and privacy framework for cross-European data exchange by employing a secure and private federated framework to empower companies, organizations, and individuals to securely access data across different disciplines, use and re-use data and metadata to extract knowledge with trust. In particular we present our work on implementing strong authentication and continuous authorization schemes based on the duality of eIDAS trust framework and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) management to ensure security and trust over authentication, authorization and accounting processes for healthcare.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on making deep learning models interpretable and understandable to human decision-makers. In this study, we introduce xAAEnet, a novel xAI model applied to the assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity. OSA is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to numerous medical conditions and is currently assessed using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, AHI has been criticized for its inability to accurately estimate the effect of OSAs on related medical conditions. To address this issue, we propose a human-centric xAI approach that emphasizes similarity between apneic events as a whole and reduces subjectivity in diagnosis by examining how the model makes its decisions. Our model was trained and tested on a dataset of 60 patients' Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model, xAAEnet, outperforms models with traditional architectures such as convolutional regressor, autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE). This study highlights the potential of xAI in providing an objective OSA severity scoring method.Clinical relevance- This study provides an objective OSA severity scoring technique which could improve the management of apneic patients in clinical practice.

Abstract: Combined functional-anatomic imaging modalities, which integrate the benefits of visualizing gross anatomy along with the functional or metabolic information of tissue has revolutionized the world of medical imaging. However, such existing imaging modalities are very costly. An alternative option could be a hybrid modality combining contrast-enhanced ultrasound, doppler and photoacoustic imaging. In the current study, we propose an artificial intelligence assisted multi-modal imaging platform where we have used U-net model for segmenting the anatomical features from the ultrasound images obtained from an animal model study. The neural network has performed accurately for three different cases, each with a high dice score. The model was co-validated with doppler images. Further, blood perfusion and tissue oxygenation information from the predicted anatomical structures were also studied. The present findings confirm the feasibility of using this multimodal imaging modality facilitated by artificial intelligence for better understanding of the hemodynamics of the kidney.Clinical Relevance-A multi-modal imaging technique has been proposed which would provide anatomical and functional information to the clinicians for early detection and tracking of the disease prognosis. Unlike existing imaging modalities like PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography- Computed Tomography), the proposed modality is much more costeffective and radiation free (non-ionizing nature).

Abstract: Automatic signal analysis using artificial intelligence is getting popular in digital healthcare, such as ECG rhythm analysis, where ECG signals are collected from traditional ECG machines or wearable ECG sensors. However, the risk of using an automated system for ECG analysis when noise is present can lead to incorrect diagnosis or treatment decisions. A noise detector is crucial to minimise the risk of incorrect diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) models are used in ECG noise detection before clinical decision-making systems to mitigate false alarms. However, it is essential to prove the generalisation capability of the ML model in different situations. ML models performance is 50% lesser when the model is trained with synthetic and tested with physiologic ECG datasets compared to trained and tested with physiologic ECG datasets. This suggests that the ML model must be trained with physiologic ECG datasets rather than synthetic ones or add more various types of noise in synthetic ECG datasets that can mimic physiologic ECG.Clinical relevance- ML model trained with synthetic noisy ECG can increase the 50% misclassification rate in ECG noise detection compared to training with physiologic ECG datasets. The wrong classification of noise-free and noisy ECG will lead to misdiagnosis regarding the patient's condition, which could be a cause of death.

Abstract: Brain-like artificial intelligence in electronics can be built efficiently by understanding the connectivity of neuronal circuitry. The concept of neural connectivity inference with a two-dimensional cross-bar structure memristor array is indicated in recent studies; however, large-scale implementation is challenging owing to device variations and the requirement of online parameter adaptation. This study proposes a neural connectivity inference method with one-dimensional spiking neurons using spike timing-dependent plasticity and presynaptic spike-driven spike timing-dependent plasticity learning rules, designed for a large-scale neuromorphic system. The proposed learning process decreases the number of spiking neurons by half. We simulate 12 ground-truth neural networks comprising one-dimensional eight and 64 neurons. We analyze the correlation between the neural connectivity of the ground truth and spiking neural networks using the Matthews correlation coefficient. In addition, we analyze the sensitivity and specificity of inference. Validation using the presynaptic spike-driven spike timing-dependent plasticity learning rule implies a potential approach for large-scale neural network inference with real hardware realization of large-scale neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Commercial ultrasound vascular phantoms lack the anatomic diversity required for robust pre-clinical interventional device testing. We fabricated individualized phantoms to test an artificial intelligence enabled ultrasound-guided surgical robotic system (AI-GUIDE) which allows novices to cannulate deep vessels. After segmenting vessels on computed tomography scans, vessel cores, bony anatomy, and a mold tailored to the skin contour were 3D-printed. Vessel cores were coated in silicone, surrounded in tissue-mimicking gel tailored for ultrasound and needle insertion, and dissolved with water. One upper arm and four inguinal phantoms were constructed. Operators used AI-GUIDE to deploy needles into phantom vessels. Two groin phantoms were tested due to imaging artifacts in the other two phantoms. Six operators (medical experience: none, 3; 1-5 years, 2; 5+ years, 1) inserted 27 inguinal needles with 81% (22/27) success in a median of 48 seconds. Seven operators performed 24 arm injections, without tuning the AI for arm anatomy, with 71% (17/24) success. After excluding failures due to motor malfunction and a defective needle, success rate was 100% (22/22) in the groin and 85% (17/20) in the arm. Individualized 3D-printed phantoms permit testing of surgical robotics across a large number of operators and different anatomic sites. AI-GUIDE operators rapidly and reliably inserted a needle into target vessels in the upper arm and groin, even without prior medical training. Virtual device trials in individualized 3-D printed phantoms may improve rigor of results and expedite translation.Clinical Relevance- Individualized phantoms enable rigorous and efficient evaluation of interventional devices and reduce the need for animal and human subject testing.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into digital pathology has the potential to automate and improve various tasks, such as image analysis and diagnostic decision-making. Yet, the inherent variability of tissues, together with the need for image labeling, lead to biased datasets that limit the generalizability of algorithms trained on them. One of the emerging solutions for this challenge is synthetic histological images. Debiasing real datasets require not only generating photorealistic images but also the ability to control the cellular features within them. A common approach is to use generative methods that perform image translation between semantic masks that reflect prior knowledge of the tissue and a histological image. However, unlike other image domains, the complex structure of the tissue prevents a simple creation of histology semantic masks that are required as input to the image translation model, while semantic masks extracted from real images reduce the process's scalability. In this work, we introduce a scalable generative model, coined as DEPAS (De-novo Pathology Semantic Masks), that captures tissue structure and generates high-resolution semantic masks with state-of-the-art quality. We demonstrate the ability of DEPAS to generate realistic semantic maps of tissue for three types of organs: skin, prostate, and lung. Moreover, we show that these masks can be processed using a generative image translation model to produce photorealistic histology images of two types of cancer with two different types of staining techniques. Finally, we harness DEPAS to generate multi-label semantic masks that capture different cell types distributions and use them to produce histological images with on-demand cellular features. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of generating synthetic histological images while controlling their semantic information in a scalable way.

Abstract: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are tiny chronic brain haemorrhages that have been recognised as prognostic indicators for a number of acute cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke, traumatic disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. For early-stage chronic disease diagnosis, it is challenging to automate the detection of CMBs and increase the reliability of prediction outputs. This study developed a system for identifying microbleeds in MRI images and gene expression data and determining the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initially, a spike neural network (SNN) and decision tree were utilised to identify microbleeds in AD from MRI images and gene expression respectively. However, the conclusions of these two methods cannot be interpreted due to the complexity of their internal processing steps. This study proposed two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for interpreting prediction outputs in an effort to boost reliability. Pixel density analysis (PDA) and probabilistic graphical model (PGM) explain the decision-making processes for MRI images and gene expression data for the diagnosis of microbleeds and the severity analysis of AD.

Abstract: Counting the number of times a patient coughs per day is an essential biomarker in determining treatment efficacy for novel antitussive therapies and personalizing patient care. Automatic cough counting tools must provide accurate information, while running on a lightweight, portable device that protects the patient's privacy. Several devices and algorithms have been developed for cough counting, but many use only error-prone audio signals, rely on offline processing that compromises data privacy, or utilize processing and memory-intensive neural networks that require more hardware resources than can fit on a wearable device. Therefore, there is a need for wearable devices that employ multimodal sensors to perform accurate, privacy-preserving, automatic cough counting algorithms directly on the device in an edge Artificial Intelligence (edge-AI) fashion. To advance this research field, we contribute the first publicly accessible cough counting dataset of multimodal biosignals. The database contains nearly 4 hours of biosignal data, with both acoustic and kinematic modalities, covering 4,300 annotated cough events from 15 subjects. Furthermore, a variety of non-cough sounds and motion scenarios mimicking daily life activities are also present, which the research community can use to accelerate machine learning (ML) algorithm development. A technical validation of the dataset reveals that it represents a wide variety of signal-to-noise ratios, which can be expected in a real-life use case, as well as consistency across experimental trials. Finally, to demonstrate the usability of the dataset, we train a simple cough vs non-cough signal classifier that obtains a 91% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 80% precision on unseen test subject data. Such edge-friendly AI algorithms have the potential to provide continuous ambulatory monitoring of the numerous chronic cough patients.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that variations in cognitive and emotional behavior are associated with variations in brain function. To achieve a more comprehensive assessment, data-driven techniques, specifically independent component analysis (ICA), can be employed to generate outcome variables that describe unique but complementary aspects of functional connectivity within and between networks. In this study, resting-state fMRI and behavioral data were collected from 50 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. The neuropsychological battery evaluated performance in various domains, including episodic memory, fluid intelligence, attention, working memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and processing speed. Emotional measures were also included to assess emotion recognition and negative affects (sadness, fear, and anger). A multivariate approach was adopted to evaluate the association between cognitive abilities and emotional correlates on spatiotemporal features of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). The results were explored at a false discovery rate-corrected threshold of p < 0.05. There was a significant positive association between within-network connectivity of the left central executive network (CEN) and inhibitory control and attention, and a significant negative association between within-network connectivity of the right CEN and episodic memory. Furthermore, increased within-network connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) was linked to higher fluid intelligence, while within-network connectivity in the salience network (SN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) was associated with cognitive flexibility. Anger was found to be significantly related to increased functional network connectivity between SN and CEN. Sadness and fear were associated with increased within-network connectivity of the right CEN. Additionally, fear was associated with low-frequency spectral power in SN and DMN. These findings offer new insights into the intricate relation between ICN features and cognitive and emotional functions.

Title: Machine learning analyses identify multi-modal frailty factors that selectively discriminate four cohorts in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum: a COMPASS-ND study.
Author: ['Bohn L', 'Drouin SM', 'McFall GP', 'Rolfson DB', 'Andrew MK', 'Dixon RA']
Journal Title: BMC geriatrics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frailty indicators can operate in dynamic amalgamations of disease conditions, clinical symptoms, biomarkers, medical signals, cognitive characteristics, and even health beliefs and practices. This study is the first to evaluate which, among these multiple frailty-related indicators, are important and differential predictors of clinical cohorts that represent progression along an Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. We applied machine-learning technology to such indicators in order to identify the leading predictors of three AD spectrum cohorts; viz., subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. The common benchmark was a cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. METHODS: The four cohorts were from the cross-sectional Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia dataset. We used random forest analysis (Python 3.7) to simultaneously test the relative importance of 83 multi-modal frailty indicators in discriminating the cohorts. We performed an explainable artificial intelligence method (Tree Shapley Additive exPlanation values) for deep interpretation of prediction effects. RESULTS: We observed strong concurrent prediction results, with clusters varying across cohorts. The SCI model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). Three leading predictors were poorer quality of life ([QoL]; memory), abnormal lymphocyte count, and abnormal neutrophil count. The MCI model demonstrated a similarly high AUC (0.88). Five leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory, leisure), male sex, abnormal lymphocyte count, and poorer self-rated eyesight. The AD model demonstrated outstanding prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.98). Ten leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory), reduced olfaction, male sex, increased dependence in activities of daily living (n = 6), and poorer visual contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Both convergent and cohort-specific frailty factors discriminated the AD spectrum cohorts. Convergence was observed as all cohorts were marked by lower quality of life (memory), supporting recent research and clinical attention to subjective experiences of memory aging and their potentially broad ramifications. Diversity was displayed in that, of the 14 leading predictors extracted across models, 11 were selectively sensitive to one cohort. A morbidity intensity trend was indicated by an increasing number and diversity of predictors corresponding to clinical severity, especially in AD. Knowledge of differential deficit predictors across AD clinical cohorts may promote precision interventions.

Title: Image-based AI diagnostic performance for fatty liver: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Author: ['Zhao Q', 'Lan Y', 'Yin X', 'Wang K']
Journal Title: BMC medical imaging
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The gold standard to diagnose fatty liver is pathology. Recently, image-based artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to have high diagnostic performance. We systematically reviewed studies of image-based AI in the diagnosis of fatty liver. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase and assessed the quality of included studies by QUADAS-AI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) were generated to identify the diagnostic accuracy of AI models. RESULTS: 15 studies were selected in our meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% CI: 90-93%) and 94% (95% CI: 93-96%), PLR and NLR were 12.67 (95% CI: 7.65-20.98) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06-0.13), DOR was 182.36 (95% CI: 94.85-350.61). After subgroup analysis by AI algorithm (conventional machine learning/deep learning), region, reference (US, MRI or pathology), imaging techniques (MRI or US) and transfer learning, the model also demonstrated acceptable diagnostic efficacy. CONCLUSION: AI has satisfactory performance in the diagnosis of fatty liver by medical imaging. The integration of AI into imaging devices may produce effective diagnostic tools, but more high-quality studies are needed for further evaluation.

Title: Severity of error in hierarchical datasets.
Author: ['Srivastava S', 'Mishra D']
Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: Classification tasks today, especially for the medical domain, use datasets which are often hierarchical. These tasks are approached using methods that consider the class taxonomy for predicting a label. The classifiers are gradually becoming increasingly accurate over the complex datasets. While increasing accuracy is a good way to judge a model, in high-risk applications, it needs to be ensured that even if the model makes a mistake, it does not bear a severe consequence. This work explores the concept of severity of an error and extends it to the medical domain. Further, it aims to point out that accuracy or AUROC alone are not sufficient metrics to decide the performance of a model in a setting where a misclassification will incur a severe cost. Various approaches to reduce severity for classification models are compared and evaluated in this work, which indicate that while many of them might be suited for a traditional image classification setting, there is a need for techniques tailored toward tasks and settings of medical domain to push artificial intelligence in healthcare to a deployable state.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are immune-mediated conditions that are increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide. Their assessment and monitoring are becoming increasingly important, though complex. The best disease control is achieved through tight monitoring of objective inflammatory parameters (such as serum and stool inflammatory markers), cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic assessment. Considering the complexity of the information obtained throughout a patient's journey, artificial intelligence (AI) provides an ideal adjunct to existing tools to help diagnose, monitor and predict the course of disease of patients with IBD. Therefore, we propose a scoping review assessing AI's role in diagnosis, monitoring and prognostication tools in patients with IBD. We aim to detect gaps in the literature and address them in future research endeavours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore. Two reviewers will independently screen the abstracts and titles first and then perform the full-text review. A third reviewer will resolve any conflict. We will include both observational studies and clinical trials. Study characteristics will be extracted using a data extraction form. The extracted data will be summarised in a tabular format, following the imaging modality theme and the study outcome assessed. The results will have an accompanying narrative review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Considering the nature of the project, ethical review by an institutional review board is not required. The data will be presented at academic conferences, and the final product will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
