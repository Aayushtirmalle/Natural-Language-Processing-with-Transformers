Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) and Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are increasingly represented in the general population. We propose a screening strategy based on algorithms calculated from quantitative and analytical data from the XN analyser. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the performance of previously published MDS and CMML scores on an evaluation cohort of 749 individual eligible patients over 50 years of age. These patients were classified into 3 groups as follows: 713 patients without MDS or CMML, 18 patients with MDS, and finally 18 patients with CMML. In a second step, a routine cohort of 37 828 samples was studied to evaluate the impact of this approach. RESULTS: The concordance rate between cytology and the two scores is 92.1%. The sensitivity and specificity of the CMML score are 100% and 96.2%, respectively. For the MDS score, they are 83.3% and 89.6% respectively. The ratio of platelets measured by fluorescence on board (PLT-F) as reflex tests generated is 1.5% after 6 months. The additional smear ratio for suspected MDS is calculated at 0.6%. CONCLUSION: We propose a flowchart using embedded artificial intelligence to help the cytologist in an optimized smear review and thus improve guidance to the clinician and the patients in the diagnosis process. This strategy permits a more comprehensive approach to MDS and CMML detection fitting with the new definition of CMML according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) published in 2022.

Abstract: After the introduction of recurrence, an important property of the biological brain, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved unprecedented classification performance. But they still cannot outperform many artificial neural networks. Modularity is another crucial feature of the biological brain. It remains unclear if modularity can also improve the performance of SNNs. To investigate this idea, we proposed the modular SNN, and compared its performance with a uniform SNN without modularity by employing them to classify cortical spike trains. For the first time, a significant improvement was found in our modular SNN. Further, we probed into the factors influencing the performance of the modular SNN and found: (a). The modular SNN outperformed the uniform SNN more significantly when the number of neurons in the networks increased; (b). The performance of the modular SNNs increased as the number of modules dropped. These preliminary but novel findings suggest that modularity may help develop better artificial intelligence and brain-machine interfaces. Also, the modular SNN may serve as a model for the study of neuronal spike synchrony.

Abstract: Respiratory disease, the third leading cause of deaths globally, is considered a high-priority ailment requiring significant research on identification and treatment. Stethoscope-recorded lung sounds and artificial intelligence-powered devices have been used to identify lung disorders and aid specialists in making accurate diagnoses. In this study, audio-spectrogram vision transformer (AS-ViT), a new approach for identifying abnormal respiration sounds, was developed. The sounds of the lungs are converted into visual representations called spectrograms using a technique called short-time Fourier transform (STFT). These images are then analyzed using a model called vision transformer to identify different types of respiratory sounds. The classification was carried out using the ICBHI 2017 database, which includes various types of lung sounds with different frequencies, noise levels, and backgrounds. The proposed AS-ViT method was evaluated using three metrics and achieved 79.1% and 59.8% for 60:40 split ratio and 86.4% and 69.3% for 80:20 split ratio in terms of unweighted average recall and overall scores respectively for respiratory sound detection, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Total shoulder arthroplasty is the process of replacing the damaged ball and socket joint in the shoulder with a prosthesis made with polyethylene and metal components. The prosthesis helps to restore the normal range of motion and reduce pain, enabling the patient to return to their daily activities. These implants may need to be replaced over the years due to damage or wear and tear. It is a tedious and time-consuming process to identify the type of implant if medical records are not properly maintained. Artificial intelligence systems can speed up the treatment process by classifying the manufacturer and model of the prosthesis. We have proposed an encoder-decoder based classifier along with the supervised contrastive loss function that can identify the implant manufacturer effectively with increased accuracy of 92% from X-ray images overcoming the class imbalance problem.

Abstract: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant used after pediatric liver transplant. However, tacrolimus's narrow therapeutic window, reliance on physicians' experience for the dose titration, and intra- and inter-patient variability result in liver transplant patients falling out of the target tacrolimus trough levels frequently. Existing personalized dosing models based on the area-under-the-concentration over time curves require a higher frequency of blood draws than the current standard of care and may not be practically feasible. We present a small-data artificial intelligence-derived platform, CURATE.AI, that uses data from individual patients obtained once daily to model the dose and response relationship and identify suitable doses dynamically. Retrospective optimization using 6 models of CURATE.AI and data from 16 patients demonstrated good predictive performance and identified a suitable model for further investigations.Clinical Relevance- This study established and compared the predictive performance of 6 personalized tacrolimus dosing models for pediatric liver transplant patients and identified a suitable model with consistently good predictive performance based on data from pediatric liver transplant patients.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images - due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms' accuracy and validate their robustness.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers in men. Early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in reducing the mortality rate from clinically significant PCa (csPCa). In recent years, bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) has attracted great attention for the detection and diagnosis of csPCa. bpMRI is able to overcome some limitations of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) such as the use of contrast agents, the time-consuming for imaging and the costs, and achieve detection performance comparable to mpMRI. However, inter-reader agreements are currently low for prostate MRI. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the development of deep learning (DL)-based computer-aided detection and diagnosis system (CAD). However, most of the existing DL models developed for csPCa identification are restricted by the scale of data and the scarcity in labels. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised pre-training scheme named SSPT-bpMRI with an image restoration pretext task integrating four different image transformations to improve the performance of DL algorithms. Specially, we explored the potential value of the self-supervised pre-training in fully supervised and weakly supervised situations. Experiments on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the fully supervised or weakly supervised model alone.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a global public health concern. For women with suspicious breast lesions, the current diagnosis requires a biopsy, which is usually guided by ultrasound (US). However, this process is challenging due to the low quality of the US image and the complexity of dealing with the US probe and the surgical needle simultaneously, making it largely reliant on the surgeon's expertise. Some previous works employing collaborative robots emerged to improve the precision of biopsy interventions, providing an easier, safer, and more ergonomic procedure. However, for these equipment to be able to navigate around the breast autonomously, 3D breast reconstruction needs to be available. The accuracy of these systems still needs to improve, with the 3D reconstruction of the breast being one of the biggest focuses of errors. The main objective of this work is to develop a method to obtain a robust 3D reconstruction of the patient's breast, based on RGB monocular images, which later can be used to compute the robot's trajectories for the biopsy. To this end, depth estimation techniques will be developed, based on a deep learning architecture constituted by a CNN, LSTM, and MLP, to generate depth maps capable of being converted into point clouds. After merging several from multiple points of view, it is possible to generate a real-time reconstruction of the breast as a mesh. The development and validation of our method was performed using a previously described synthetic dataset. Hence, this procedure takes RGB images and the cameras' position and outputs the breasts' meshes. It has a mean error of 3.9 mm and a standard deviation of 1.2 mm. The final results attest to the ability of this methodology to predict the breast's shape and size using monocular images.Clinical Relevance- This work proposes a method based on artificial intelligence and monocular RGB images to obtain the breast's volume during robotic guided breast biopsies, improving their execution and safety.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently gained a lot of attention, as it can provide additional emotion cues that can be correlated with human social behavior. An extension towards an AI-based emotional climate (EC) recognition, i.e., the recognition of the joint emotional atmosphere dynamically created and perceived by the peers throughout a conversation, is proposed here. In our approach, namely MLBispeC (Machine Learning Based Bispectral Classification), the peers' speech signals during their conversation are subjected to time-windowed bispectral analysis, allowing for feature extraction related to dynamic harmonics nonlinear interactions. In addition, peers' affect dynamics, derived from their same time-windowed emotion labeling, are combined to form an extended feature vector, inputted into two well-known machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor). MLBispeC was evaluated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) open access dataset, which contains 2D emotions, i.e., Arousal (A) and valence (V) that are divided into (low/high) classes. The experimental results have shown that MLBispeC outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an accuracy of 0.826A/0.754V, sensitivity of 0.864A/0.774V, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.821A/0.799V. This demonstrates the effectiveness of MLBispeC to objectively recognize peers' EC during their conversation, allowing for insights into their emotional and social interactions.Clinical relevance-Unobtrusive, objective and dynamic recognition of the EC built during peers' conversation can scaffold effective assessment of patients with physiological, psychological, and mental diseases, at various age ranges (children, adults, and older adults).

Abstract: Drifted by the hype of new and efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence models aiming to unlock the information wealth hidden inside heterogeneous datasets across different markets and disciplines, healthcare data are in the center of novel technological advancements in predictive health diagnostics, remote healthcare, assistive leaving and wellbeing. Nevertheless, this emerging market has underlined the necessity of developing new methods and updating existing ones for preserving the privacy of the data and their owners, as well as, ensuring confidentiality and trust throughout the health care data processing pipelines. This paper presents one of the key innovations of a Horizon Europe funded project named "TRUSTEE", which focuses on building a trust and privacy framework for cross-European data exchange by employing a secure and private federated framework to empower companies, organizations, and individuals to securely access data across different disciplines, use and re-use data and metadata to extract knowledge with trust. In particular we present our work on implementing strong authentication and continuous authorization schemes based on the duality of eIDAS trust framework and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) management to ensure security and trust over authentication, authorization and accounting processes for healthcare.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on making deep learning models interpretable and understandable to human decision-makers. In this study, we introduce xAAEnet, a novel xAI model applied to the assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity. OSA is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to numerous medical conditions and is currently assessed using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, AHI has been criticized for its inability to accurately estimate the effect of OSAs on related medical conditions. To address this issue, we propose a human-centric xAI approach that emphasizes similarity between apneic events as a whole and reduces subjectivity in diagnosis by examining how the model makes its decisions. Our model was trained and tested on a dataset of 60 patients' Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model, xAAEnet, outperforms models with traditional architectures such as convolutional regressor, autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE). This study highlights the potential of xAI in providing an objective OSA severity scoring method.Clinical relevance- This study provides an objective OSA severity scoring technique which could improve the management of apneic patients in clinical practice.

Abstract: Combined functional-anatomic imaging modalities, which integrate the benefits of visualizing gross anatomy along with the functional or metabolic information of tissue has revolutionized the world of medical imaging. However, such existing imaging modalities are very costly. An alternative option could be a hybrid modality combining contrast-enhanced ultrasound, doppler and photoacoustic imaging. In the current study, we propose an artificial intelligence assisted multi-modal imaging platform where we have used U-net model for segmenting the anatomical features from the ultrasound images obtained from an animal model study. The neural network has performed accurately for three different cases, each with a high dice score. The model was co-validated with doppler images. Further, blood perfusion and tissue oxygenation information from the predicted anatomical structures were also studied. The present findings confirm the feasibility of using this multimodal imaging modality facilitated by artificial intelligence for better understanding of the hemodynamics of the kidney.Clinical Relevance-A multi-modal imaging technique has been proposed which would provide anatomical and functional information to the clinicians for early detection and tracking of the disease prognosis. Unlike existing imaging modalities like PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography- Computed Tomography), the proposed modality is much more costeffective and radiation free (non-ionizing nature).

Abstract: Automatic signal analysis using artificial intelligence is getting popular in digital healthcare, such as ECG rhythm analysis, where ECG signals are collected from traditional ECG machines or wearable ECG sensors. However, the risk of using an automated system for ECG analysis when noise is present can lead to incorrect diagnosis or treatment decisions. A noise detector is crucial to minimise the risk of incorrect diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) models are used in ECG noise detection before clinical decision-making systems to mitigate false alarms. However, it is essential to prove the generalisation capability of the ML model in different situations. ML models performance is 50% lesser when the model is trained with synthetic and tested with physiologic ECG datasets compared to trained and tested with physiologic ECG datasets. This suggests that the ML model must be trained with physiologic ECG datasets rather than synthetic ones or add more various types of noise in synthetic ECG datasets that can mimic physiologic ECG.Clinical relevance- ML model trained with synthetic noisy ECG can increase the 50% misclassification rate in ECG noise detection compared to training with physiologic ECG datasets. The wrong classification of noise-free and noisy ECG will lead to misdiagnosis regarding the patient's condition, which could be a cause of death.

Abstract: Brain-like artificial intelligence in electronics can be built efficiently by understanding the connectivity of neuronal circuitry. The concept of neural connectivity inference with a two-dimensional cross-bar structure memristor array is indicated in recent studies; however, large-scale implementation is challenging owing to device variations and the requirement of online parameter adaptation. This study proposes a neural connectivity inference method with one-dimensional spiking neurons using spike timing-dependent plasticity and presynaptic spike-driven spike timing-dependent plasticity learning rules, designed for a large-scale neuromorphic system. The proposed learning process decreases the number of spiking neurons by half. We simulate 12 ground-truth neural networks comprising one-dimensional eight and 64 neurons. We analyze the correlation between the neural connectivity of the ground truth and spiking neural networks using the Matthews correlation coefficient. In addition, we analyze the sensitivity and specificity of inference. Validation using the presynaptic spike-driven spike timing-dependent plasticity learning rule implies a potential approach for large-scale neural network inference with real hardware realization of large-scale neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Commercial ultrasound vascular phantoms lack the anatomic diversity required for robust pre-clinical interventional device testing. We fabricated individualized phantoms to test an artificial intelligence enabled ultrasound-guided surgical robotic system (AI-GUIDE) which allows novices to cannulate deep vessels. After segmenting vessels on computed tomography scans, vessel cores, bony anatomy, and a mold tailored to the skin contour were 3D-printed. Vessel cores were coated in silicone, surrounded in tissue-mimicking gel tailored for ultrasound and needle insertion, and dissolved with water. One upper arm and four inguinal phantoms were constructed. Operators used AI-GUIDE to deploy needles into phantom vessels. Two groin phantoms were tested due to imaging artifacts in the other two phantoms. Six operators (medical experience: none, 3; 1-5 years, 2; 5+ years, 1) inserted 27 inguinal needles with 81% (22/27) success in a median of 48 seconds. Seven operators performed 24 arm injections, without tuning the AI for arm anatomy, with 71% (17/24) success. After excluding failures due to motor malfunction and a defective needle, success rate was 100% (22/22) in the groin and 85% (17/20) in the arm. Individualized 3D-printed phantoms permit testing of surgical robotics across a large number of operators and different anatomic sites. AI-GUIDE operators rapidly and reliably inserted a needle into target vessels in the upper arm and groin, even without prior medical training. Virtual device trials in individualized 3-D printed phantoms may improve rigor of results and expedite translation.Clinical Relevance- Individualized phantoms enable rigorous and efficient evaluation of interventional devices and reduce the need for animal and human subject testing.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into digital pathology has the potential to automate and improve various tasks, such as image analysis and diagnostic decision-making. Yet, the inherent variability of tissues, together with the need for image labeling, lead to biased datasets that limit the generalizability of algorithms trained on them. One of the emerging solutions for this challenge is synthetic histological images. Debiasing real datasets require not only generating photorealistic images but also the ability to control the cellular features within them. A common approach is to use generative methods that perform image translation between semantic masks that reflect prior knowledge of the tissue and a histological image. However, unlike other image domains, the complex structure of the tissue prevents a simple creation of histology semantic masks that are required as input to the image translation model, while semantic masks extracted from real images reduce the process's scalability. In this work, we introduce a scalable generative model, coined as DEPAS (De-novo Pathology Semantic Masks), that captures tissue structure and generates high-resolution semantic masks with state-of-the-art quality. We demonstrate the ability of DEPAS to generate realistic semantic maps of tissue for three types of organs: skin, prostate, and lung. Moreover, we show that these masks can be processed using a generative image translation model to produce photorealistic histology images of two types of cancer with two different types of staining techniques. Finally, we harness DEPAS to generate multi-label semantic masks that capture different cell types distributions and use them to produce histological images with on-demand cellular features. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of generating synthetic histological images while controlling their semantic information in a scalable way.

Abstract: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are tiny chronic brain haemorrhages that have been recognised as prognostic indicators for a number of acute cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke, traumatic disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. For early-stage chronic disease diagnosis, it is challenging to automate the detection of CMBs and increase the reliability of prediction outputs. This study developed a system for identifying microbleeds in MRI images and gene expression data and determining the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initially, a spike neural network (SNN) and decision tree were utilised to identify microbleeds in AD from MRI images and gene expression respectively. However, the conclusions of these two methods cannot be interpreted due to the complexity of their internal processing steps. This study proposed two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for interpreting prediction outputs in an effort to boost reliability. Pixel density analysis (PDA) and probabilistic graphical model (PGM) explain the decision-making processes for MRI images and gene expression data for the diagnosis of microbleeds and the severity analysis of AD.

Abstract: Counting the number of times a patient coughs per day is an essential biomarker in determining treatment efficacy for novel antitussive therapies and personalizing patient care. Automatic cough counting tools must provide accurate information, while running on a lightweight, portable device that protects the patient's privacy. Several devices and algorithms have been developed for cough counting, but many use only error-prone audio signals, rely on offline processing that compromises data privacy, or utilize processing and memory-intensive neural networks that require more hardware resources than can fit on a wearable device. Therefore, there is a need for wearable devices that employ multimodal sensors to perform accurate, privacy-preserving, automatic cough counting algorithms directly on the device in an edge Artificial Intelligence (edge-AI) fashion. To advance this research field, we contribute the first publicly accessible cough counting dataset of multimodal biosignals. The database contains nearly 4 hours of biosignal data, with both acoustic and kinematic modalities, covering 4,300 annotated cough events from 15 subjects. Furthermore, a variety of non-cough sounds and motion scenarios mimicking daily life activities are also present, which the research community can use to accelerate machine learning (ML) algorithm development. A technical validation of the dataset reveals that it represents a wide variety of signal-to-noise ratios, which can be expected in a real-life use case, as well as consistency across experimental trials. Finally, to demonstrate the usability of the dataset, we train a simple cough vs non-cough signal classifier that obtains a 91% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 80% precision on unseen test subject data. Such edge-friendly AI algorithms have the potential to provide continuous ambulatory monitoring of the numerous chronic cough patients.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that variations in cognitive and emotional behavior are associated with variations in brain function. To achieve a more comprehensive assessment, data-driven techniques, specifically independent component analysis (ICA), can be employed to generate outcome variables that describe unique but complementary aspects of functional connectivity within and between networks. In this study, resting-state fMRI and behavioral data were collected from 50 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. The neuropsychological battery evaluated performance in various domains, including episodic memory, fluid intelligence, attention, working memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and processing speed. Emotional measures were also included to assess emotion recognition and negative affects (sadness, fear, and anger). A multivariate approach was adopted to evaluate the association between cognitive abilities and emotional correlates on spatiotemporal features of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). The results were explored at a false discovery rate-corrected threshold of p < 0.05. There was a significant positive association between within-network connectivity of the left central executive network (CEN) and inhibitory control and attention, and a significant negative association between within-network connectivity of the right CEN and episodic memory. Furthermore, increased within-network connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) was linked to higher fluid intelligence, while within-network connectivity in the salience network (SN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) was associated with cognitive flexibility. Anger was found to be significantly related to increased functional network connectivity between SN and CEN. Sadness and fear were associated with increased within-network connectivity of the right CEN. Additionally, fear was associated with low-frequency spectral power in SN and DMN. These findings offer new insights into the intricate relation between ICN features and cognitive and emotional functions.
