Abstract: Objective:To analyze the influencing factors and perform the prediction of olfactory disorders in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis（CRS） based on artificial intelligence. Methods:The data of 75 patients with CRS who underwent nasal endoscopic surgery from October 2021 to February 2023 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were analyzed retrospectively. There were 53 males and 22 females enrolled in the study, with a median age of 42.0 years old. The CRS intelligent microscope interpretation system was used to calculate the proportion of area glands and blood vessels occupy in the pathological sections of each patient, and the absolute value and proportion of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. The patients were grouped according to the results of the Sniffin' Sticks smell test, and the clinical baseline data, differences in nasal mucosal histopathological characteristics, laboratory test indicators and sinus CT were compared between the groups. Determine the independent influencing factors of olfactory disorders and receiver operating characteristic curves（ROC） were used to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. Results:Among the 75 CRS patients, 25 cases（33.3%） had normal olfaction and 50 cases（66.7%） had olfactory disorders. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that tissue eosinophils percentage（OR=1.032, 95%CI 1.002-1.064, P=0.036）, Questionnaire of olfactory disorders-Negative statement（QOD-NS）（OR=1.079, 95%CI 1.004-1.160, P=0.040） and Anterior olfactory cleft score（AOCS）（OR=2.672, 95%CI 1.480-4.827, P=0.001） were independent risk factors for olfactory disorders in CRS patients. Further research found that the area under the ROC curve（AUC） of the combined prediction model established by the tissue eosinophil percentage, QOD-NS and AOCS was 0.836（95%CI 0.748-0.924, P<0.001）, which is better than the above single factor prediction model in predicting olfactory disorders in CRS. Conclusion:Based on pathological artificial intelligence, tissue eosinophil percentage, QOD-NS and AOCS are independent risk factors for olfactory disorders in CRS patients, and the combination of the three factors has a good predictive effect on CRS olfactory disorders.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov 2
Abstract: BACKGROUND: PreciseDx Breast (PDxBr) is a digital test that predicts early-stage breast cancer recurrence within 6-years of diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images of invasive breast cancer (IBC) and artificial intelligence-enabled morphology feature array, microanatomic features are generated. Morphometric attributes in combination with patient's age, tumor size, stage, and lymph node status predict disease free survival using a proprietary algorithm. Here, analytical validation of the automated annotation process and extracted histologic digital features of the PDxBr test, including impact of methodologic variability on the composite risk score is presented. Studies of precision, repeatability, reproducibility and interference were performed on morphology feature array-derived features. The final risk score was assessed over 20-days with 2-operators, 2-runs/day, and 2-replicates across 8-patients, allowing for calculation of within-run repeatability, between-run and within-laboratory reproducibility. RESULTS: Analytical validation of features derived from whole slide images demonstrated a high degree of precision for tumor segmentation (0.98, 0.98), lymphocyte detection (0.91, 0.93), and mitotic figures (0.85, 0.84). Correlation of variation of the assay risk score for both reproducibility and repeatability were less than 2%, and interference from variation in hematoxylin and eosin staining or tumor thickness was not observed demonstrating assay robustness across standard histopathology preparations. CONCLUSION: In summary, the analytical validation of the digital IBC risk assessment test demonstrated a strong performance across all features in the model and complimented the clinical validation of the assay previously shown to accurately predict recurrence within 6-years in early-stage invasive breast cancer patients.

Abstract: Network targets theory and technology have transcended the limitations of the &quot;single gene, single target&quot; model, aiming to decipher the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) based on biological network from the perspective of informatics and system. As the core of TCM network pharmacology, with the development of computer science and high-throughput experimental techniques, the network target theory and technology are beginning to exhibit a trend of organic integration with artificial intelligence technology and high-throughput multi-modal multi-omics experimental techniques. Taking the network target analysis of TCM like Yinqiao Qingre Tablets as a typical case, network target theory and technology have achieved the systematic construction, in-depth analysis, and high-throughput multi-modal multi-omics validation of multi-level biological networks spanning from traditional Chinese and Western phenotypes to tissues, cells, molecules, and traditional Chinese and Western medicines. This development helps to address critical issues in the analysis of mechanisms of TCM, including the discovery of key targets, identification of functional components, discovery of synergistic effects among compound ingredients, and elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of formulae. It provides powerful theoretical and technological support for advancing clinical precision diagnosis and treatment, precise positioning of TCM, and precise research and development of TCM. Thus, a new paradigm of TCM research gradually emerges, combining big data and artificial intelligence(AI) with the integration of human experience and scientific evidence.

Abstract: Sleep occupies one-third of a person's lifetime and is a necessary condition for maintaining physiological function and health. With the increase in social and economic pressures, the growing use of electronic devices and the accelerated aging process of the population, insufficient sleep and its hazards have drawn widespread attention from researchers in China and abroad. Sleep deprivation refers to a decrease in sleep or a severe lack of sleep due to various reasons. Previous studies have found that sleep deprivation can cause extensive damage to the body, including an increased incidence and mortality rate of neuropathic diseases in the brain, cardiovascular diseases, imbalances in the gut microbiota, and other multi-organ diseases. The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of multi-system and multi-organ diseases due to sleep deprivation mainly involve oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and impaired immune function in the body. According to traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), sleep deprivation falls into the category of sleepiness, and long-term sleepiness leads to Yin-Yang imbalance, resulting in the consumption of Qi and damage to the five Zang-organs. The appropriate treatment should focus on tonifying deficiency, reinforcing healthy Qi, and harmonizing Yin and Yang. TCM is characterized by a wide variety and abundant resources, and it has minimal side effects and a broad range of applications. Numerous studies have shown that TCM drugs and prescriptions not only improve sleep but also have beneficial effects on liver nourishment, intelligence enhancement, and kidney tonification, effectively preventing and treating the body injury caused by sleep deprivation. Given the increasing prevalence of sleep deprivation and its significant impact on body health, this article reviewed sleep deprivation-mediated body injury and its mechanism, summarized and categorized TCM compound prescriptions and single drugs for preventing and treating body injury, with the aim of laying the foundation for researchers to develop effective drugs for preventing and treating body injury caused by sleep deprivation and providing references for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the body injury caused by sleep deprivation.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 17
Abstract: Protein structure determination is a critical aspect of biological research, enabling us to understand protein function and potential applications. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence have led to the development of several protein structure prediction tools, such as AlphaFold2 and ColabFold. However, their performance has primarily been evaluated on well-characterised proteins and their ability to predict sturtctures of proteins lacking experimental structures, such as many snake venom toxins, has been less scrutinised. In this study, we evaluated three modelling tools on their prediction of over 1000 snake venom toxin structures for which no experimental structures exist. Our findings show that AlphaFold2 (AF2) performed the best across all assessed parameters. We also observed that ColabFold (CF) only scored slightly worse than AF2, while being computationally less intensive. All tools struggled with regions of intrinsic disorder, such as loops and propeptide regions, and performed well in predicting the structure of functional domains. Overall, our study highlights the importance of exercising caution when working with proteins with no experimental structures available, particularly those that are large and contain flexible regions. Nonetheless, leveraging computational structure prediction tools can provide valuable insights into the modelling of protein interactions with different targets and reveal potential binding sites, active sites, and conformational changes, as well as into the design of potential molecular binders for reagent, diagnostic, or therapeutic purposes.

Journal Title: Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: PURPOSE: Carotid ultrasound allows noninvasive assessment of vascular anatomy and function with real-time display. Based on the transfer learning method, a series of research results have been obtained on the optimal image recognition and analysis of static images. However, for carotid plaque recognition, there are high requirements for self-developed algorithms in real-time ultrasound detection. This study aims to establish an automatic recognition system, Be Easy to Use (BETU), for the real-time and synchronous diagnosis of carotid plaque from ultrasound videos based on an artificial neural network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 445 participants (mean age, 54.6+/-7.8 years; 227 men) were evaluated. Radiologists labeled a total of 3259 segmented ultrasound images from 445 videos with the diagnosis of carotid plaque, 2725 images were collected as a training dataset, and 554 images as a testing dataset. The automatic plaque recognition system BETU was established based on an artificial neural network, and remote application on a 5G environment was performed to test its diagnostic performance. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of BETU (98.5%) was consistent with the radiologist's (Kappa = 0.967, P < 0.001). Remote diagnostic feedback based on BETU-processed ultrasound videos could be obtained in 150ms across a distance of 1023 km between the ultrasound/BETU station and the consultation workstation. CONCLUSION: Based on the good performance of BETU in real-time plaque recognition from ultrasound videos, 5G plus Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted ultrasound real-time carotid plaque screening was achieved, and the diagnosis was made.

Title: On the compression of neural networks using l(0)-norm regularization and weight pruning.
Author: ['de Resende Oliveira FD', 'Batista ELO', 'Seara R']
Journal Title: Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: Despite the growing availability of high-capacity computational platforms, implementation complexity still has been a great concern for the real-world deployment of neural networks. This concern is not exclusively due to the huge costs of state-of-the-art network architectures, but also due to the recent push towards edge intelligence and the use of neural networks in embedded applications. In this context, network compression techniques have been gaining interest due to their ability for reducing deployment costs while keeping inference accuracy at satisfactory levels. The present paper is dedicated to the development of a novel compression scheme for neural networks. To this end, a new form of l(0)-norm-based regularization is firstly developed, which is capable of inducing strong sparseness in the network during training. Then, targeting the smaller weights of the trained network with pruning techniques, smaller yet highly effective networks can be obtained. The proposed compression scheme also involves the use of l(2)-norm regularization to avoid overfitting as well as fine tuning to improve the performance of the pruned network. Experimental results are presented aiming to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as well as to make comparisons with competing approaches.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of endocytoscopy via artificial intelligence in colorectal lesions: A systematic review and meta‑analysis.
Author: ['Zhang H', 'Yang X', 'Tao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Huang X']
Journal Title: PloS one
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endocytoscopy (EC) is a nuclei and micro-vessels visualization in real-time and can facilitate "optical biopsy" and "virtual histology" of colorectal lesions. This study aimed to investigate the significance of employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of endoscopy, specifically in diagnosing colorectal lesions. The research was conducted under the supervision of experienced professionals and trainees. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and other potential databases were surveyed for articles related to the EC with AI published before September 2023. RevMan (5.40), Stata (14.0), and R software (4.1.0) were used for statistical assessment. Studies that measured the accuracy of EC using AI for colorectal lesions were included. Two authors independently assessed the selected studies and their extracted data. This included information such as the country, literature, total study population, study design, characteristics of the fundamental study and control groups, sensitivity, number of samples, assay methodology, specificity, true positives or negatives, and false positives or negatives. The diagnostic accuracy of EC by AI was determined by a bivariate random-effects model, avoiding a high heterogeneity effect. The ANOVA model was employed to determine the more effective approach. RESULTS: A total of 223 studies were reviewed; 8 articles were selected that included 2984 patients (4241 lesions) for systematic review and meta-analysis. AI assessed 4069 lesions; experts diagnosed 3165 and 5014 by trainees. AI demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity levels in detecting colorectal lesions, with values of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.95) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.99). Expert diagnosis was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.94), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.93), and trainee diagnosis was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.79), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.80). With the EC by AI, the AUC from SROC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97), therefore classified as excellent category, expert showed 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97), and the trainee had 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.82). The superior index from the ANOVA model was 4.00 (1.15,5.00), 2.00 (1.15,5.00), and 0.20 (0.20,0.20), respectively. The examiners conducted meta-regression and subgroup analyses to evaluate the presence of heterogeneity. The findings of these investigations suggest that the utilization of NBI technology was correlated with variability in sensitivity and specificity. There was a lack of solid evidence indicating the presence of publishing bias. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that using AI in EC can potentially enhance the efficiency of diagnosing colorectal abnormalities. As a valuable instrument, it can enhance prognostic outcomes in ordinary EC procedures, exhibiting superior diagnostic accuracy compared to trainee-level endoscopists and demonstrating comparability to expert endoscopists. The research is subject to certain constraints, namely a limited number of clinical investigations and variations in the methodologies used for identification. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct comprehensive and extensive research to enhance the precision of diagnostic procedures.

Title: Explainable artificial intelligence for omics data: a systematic mapping study.
Author: ['Toussaint PA', 'Leiser F', 'Thiebes S', 'Schlesner M', 'Brors B', 'Sunyaev A']
Journal Title: Briefings in bioinformatics
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: Researchers increasingly turn to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze omics data and gain insights into the underlying biological processes. Yet, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, many findings have only been shared in their respective research community. An overview of XAI for omics data is needed to highlight promising approaches and help detect common issues. Toward this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study. To identify relevant literature, we queried Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv. Based on keywording, we developed a coding scheme with 10 facets regarding the studies' AI methods, explainability methods and omics data. Our mapping study resulted in 405 included papers published between 2010 and 2023. The inspected papers analyze DNA-based (mostly genomic), transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data by means of neural networks, tree-based methods, statistical methods and further AI methods. The preferred post-hoc explainability methods are feature relevance (n = 166) and visual explanation (n = 52), while papers using interpretable approaches often resort to the use of transparent models (n = 83) or architecture modifications (n = 72). With many research gaps still apparent for XAI for omics data, we deduced eight research directions and discuss their potential for the field. We also provide exemplary research questions for each direction. Many problems with the adoption of XAI for omics data in clinical practice are yet to be resolved. This systematic mapping study outlines extant research on the topic and provides research directions for researchers and practitioners.

Journal Title: JAMA network open
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Limited sharing of data sets that accurately represent disease and patient diversity limits the generalizability of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in health care. OBJECTIVE: To explore the factors associated with organizational motivation to share health data for AI development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study investigated organizational readiness for sharing health data across the academic, governmental, nonprofit, and private sectors. Using a multiple case studies approach, 27 semistructured interviews were conducted with leaders in data-sharing roles from August 29, 2022, to January 9, 2023. The interviews were conducted in the English language using a video conferencing platform. Using a purposive and nonprobabilistic sampling strategy, 78 individuals across 52 unique organizations were identified. Of these, 35 participants were enrolled. Participant recruitment concluded after 27 interviews, as theoretical saturation was reached and no additional themes emerged. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Concepts defining organizational readiness for data sharing and the association between data-sharing factors and organizational behavior were mapped through iterative qualitative analysis to establish a framework defining organizational readiness for sharing clinical data for AI development. RESULTS: Interviews included 27 leaders from 18 organizations (academia: 10, government: 7, nonprofit: 8, and private: 2). Organizational readiness for data sharing centered around 2 main constructs: motivation and capabilities. Motivation related to the alignment of an organization's values with data-sharing priorities and was associated with its engagement in data-sharing efforts. However, organizational motivation could be modulated by extrinsic incentives for financial or reputational gains. Organizational capabilities comprised infrastructure, people, expertise, and access to data. Cross-sector collaboration was a key strategy to mitigate barriers to access health data. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This qualitative study identified sector-specific factors that may affect the data-sharing behaviors of health organizations. External incentives may bolster cross-sector collaborations by helping overcome barriers to accessing health data for AI development. The findings suggest that tailored incentives may boost organizational motivation and facilitate sustainable flow of health data for AI development.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Artificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. INTERVENTIONS: Clinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient's acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Median participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians' baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, -2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06098950.

Abstract: Integration of digital pathology (DP) into clinical diagnostic workflows is increasingly receiving attention as new hardware and software become available. To facilitate the adoption of DP, the Swiss Digital Pathology Consortium (SDiPath) organized a Delphi process to produce a series of recommendations for DP integration within Swiss clinical environments. This process saw the creation of 4 working groups, focusing on the various components of a DP system (1) scanners, quality assurance and validation of scans, (2) integration of Whole Slide Image (WSI)-scanners and DP systems into the Pathology Laboratory Information System, (3) digital workflow-compliance with general quality guidelines, and (4) image analysis (IA)/artificial intelligence (AI), with topic experts for each recruited for discussion and statement generation. The work product of the Delphi process is 83 consensus statements presented here, forming the basis for "SDiPath Recommendations for Digital Pathology". They represent an up-to-date resource for national and international hospitals, researchers, device manufacturers, algorithm developers, and all supporting fields, with the intent of providing expectations and best practices to help ensure safe and efficient DP usage.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: The cardiovascular risk associated with LVH in the community and, particularly, in the hypertensive fraction of the general population, represents the rationale for its timely and accurate identification in order to implement adequate preventive strategies. Although electrocardiography (ECG) is the first-line and most economical method of diagnosing LVH its accuracy is largely suboptimal. Over the last seventy years, dozens of different ECG criteria, mostly based on measurements of QRS voltages, have been proposed. In this long journey, a few years ago Peguero et al. developed a novel ECG voltage criterion, currently recognized as Peguero-Lo Presti (PLP) suggesting that it has greater sensitivity than traditional ECG-LVH criteria. Considering that in the last five years numerous studies have investigated the diagnostic value of this new index, this review aimed to summarize the data published so far on this topic focusing both on the accuracy in identifying the presence of LVH compared to imaging techniques such as echocardiography (ECHO) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the value in predicting hard outcomes. The evidence in favor of the greater diagnostic accuracy of the PLP criterion in detecting LVH, phenotyped by ECHO or MRI, and in the stratification of hard outcomes compared to traditional ECG criteria does not appear to be sufficiently proven. Given that the diagnosis of LVH by all ECG criteria (including the PLP) exclusively based on the QRS amplitude is largely imprecise, the development of new multiparametric ECG criteria based on artificial intelligence could represent a real improvement in the diagnostic capacity of the ECG.

Journal Title: Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: Explicit logical reasoning, like transitive inference, is a hallmark of human intelligence. This study investigated cortical oscillations and their interactions in transitive inference with EEG. Participants viewed premises describing abstract relations among items. They accurately recalled the relationship between old pairs of items, effectively inferred the relationship between new pairs of items, and discriminated between true and false relationships for new pairs. First, theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha oscillations (8-15 Hz) had distinct functional roles. Frontal theta oscillations distinguished between new and old pairs, reflecting the inference of new information. Parietal alpha oscillations changed with serial position and symbolic distance of the pairs, representing the underlying relational structure. Frontal alpha oscillations distinguished between true and false pairs, linking the new information with the underlying relational structure. Second, theta and alpha oscillations interacted through cross-frequency and inter-regional phase synchronization. Frontal theta-alpha 1:2 phase locking appeared to coordinate spectrally diverse neural activity, enhanced for new versus old pairs and true versus false pairs. Alpha-band frontal-parietal phase coherence appeared to coordinate anatomically distributed neural activity, enhanced for new versus old pairs and false versus true pairs. It suggests that cross-frequency and inter-regional phase synchronization among theta and alpha oscillations supports human transitive inference.

Abstract: In the last year, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a web software based on artificial intelligence has been showing high potential in every field of knowledge. In the medical area, its possible application is an object of many studies with promising results. We performed the current study to investigate the possible usefulness of ChatGPT in assessing low back pain. We asked ChatGPT to generate a questionnaire about this clinical condition and we compared the obtained questions and results with the ones obtained by other validated questionnaires: Oswestry Disability Index, Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and Numeric Rating Scale for pain. We enrolled 20 subjects with low back pain and we found important consistencies among the validated questionnaires. The ChatGPT questionnaire showed an acceptable significant correlation only with Oswestry Disability Index and Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale. ChatGPT showed some peculiarities, especially in the assessment of quality of life and medical consultation and treatments. Our study shows that ChatGPT can help evaluate patients, including multilevel perspectives. However, its power is limited, and further research and validation are required.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Artificial intelligence-powered digital pathology offers the potential to quantify histological findings in a reproducible way. This analysis compares the evaluation of histological features of NASH between pathologists and a machine-learning (ML) pathology model. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This post hoc analysis included data from a subset of patients (n=251) with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis stage F1-F3 from a 72-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg (NCT02970942). Biopsies at baseline and week 72 were read by 2 pathologists. Digitized biopsy slides were evaluated by PathAI's NASH ML models to quantify changes in fibrosis, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning using categorical assessments and continuous scores. Pathologist and ML-derived categorical assessments detected a significantly greater percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis with semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo (pathologist 58.5% vs. 22.0%, p < 0.0001; ML 36.9% vs. 11.9%; p =0.0015). Both methods detected a higher but nonsignificant percentage of patients on semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo achieving the secondary endpoint of liver fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. ML continuous scores detected significant treatment-induced responses in histological features, including a quantitative reduction in fibrosis with semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo ( p =0.0099) that could not be detected using pathologist or ML categorical assessment. CONCLUSIONS: ML categorical assessments reproduced pathologists' results of histological improvement with semaglutide for steatosis and disease activity. ML-based continuous scores demonstrated an antifibrotic effect not measured by conventional histopathology.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim: Evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of the ChatGPT in the field of medical diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We utilized 50 clinical cases, employing Large Language Model ChatGPT-3.5. The experiment had three phases, each with a new chat setup. In the initial phase, ChatGPT received detailed clinical case descriptions, guided by a "Persona Pattern" prompt. In the second phase, cases with diagnostic errors were addressed by providing potential diagnoses for ChatGPT to choose from. The final phase assessed artificial intelligence's ability to mimic a medical practitioner's diagnostic process, with prompts limiting initial information to symptoms and history. RESULTS: Results: In the initial phase, ChatGPT showed a 66.00% diagnostic accuracy, surpassing physicians by nearly 50%. Notably, in 11 cases requiring image inter notpretation, ChatGPT struggled initially but achieved a correct diagnosis for four without added interpretations. In the second phase, ChatGPT demonstrated a remarkable 70.59% diagnostic accuracy, while physicians averaged 41.47%. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of Large Language Model in first and second phases together was 90.00%. In the third phase emulating real doctor decision-making, ChatGPT achieved a 46.00% success rate. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Our research underscores ChatGPT's strong potential in clinical medicine as a diagnostic tool, especially in structured scenarios. It emphasizes the need for supplementary data and the complexity of medical diagnosis. This contributes valuable insights to AI-driven clinical diagnostics, with a nod to the importance of prompt engineering techniques in ChatGPT's interaction with doctors.

Title: Precision Hypertension.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Hypertension affects >1 billion people worldwide. Complications of hypertension include stroke, renal failure, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure. Despite the development of various antihypertensive drugs, the number of people with uncontrolled hypertension continues to rise. While the lack of compliance associated with frequent side effects to medication is a contributory issue, there has been a failure to consider the diverse nature of hypertensive populations. Instead, we propose that hypertension can only be truly managed by precision. A precision medicine approach would consider each patient's unique factors. In this review, we discuss the progress toward precision medicine for hypertension with more predictiveness and individualization of treatment. We will highlight the advances in data science, omics (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc), artificial intelligence, gene therapy, and gene editing and their application to precision hypertension.

Abstract: Liquid detection probes used to identify the features of liquids show great promise in a variety of important applications. However, some challenges, such as sample contamination by direct contact with the liquid, the requirement of additional signal emitters, and complex fabrication, hindered the development of liquid detection probes. Here, we developed a non-invasive shadow probe (SP) for a multi-feature intelligent liquid surveillance system (ILSS). The self-powered SP with the working mechanism of the shadow effect can detect the features of liquids by analyzing the variations of liquid shadows such as the area, wavelength, and brightness. The exact resolution (5 different colors, 6 different concentrations, 6 different levels, 100% accuracy) and fast response time (0.2 ms) are shown by the SP under ambient light conditions (even in 0.003 sun). The ILSS, which integrated the SPs with signal processing circuits and applied the artificial intelligence (AI) technique, successfully detects and synoptically learns about liquids simultaneously. The in-real time ILSS reaches a test accuracy of 99.3% for 10 types of liquids with multiple features. This work showcases a promising solution for non-invasive multi-feature liquid detection, displaying great potential for future applications.
