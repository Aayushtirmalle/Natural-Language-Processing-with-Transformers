Title: AI is transforming how science is done. Science education must reflect this change.
Author: ['Erduran S']
Journal Title: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: There is growing interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education. Many issues and questions raised about the role of AI in science education target primarily science learning objectives. They relate to AI's capacity to generate tools for teaching, learning, and assessment, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using such tools. But another important discussion receiving far too little attention in science education concerns how AI is transforming the nature of science (NOS) itself and what such transformation implies for the education of young children. For education, it is critical to ask what AI-informed NOS is, what skills it demands of learners, and how schools can aim to achieve them.

Journal Title: Journal of travel medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to pose a significant burden in endemic countries, many of which lack access to molecular surveillance. Insights from malaria cases in travellers returning to non-endemic areas can provide valuable data to inform endemic country programs. To evaluate the potential for novel global insights into malaria, we examined epidemiological and molecular data from imported malaria cases to Australia. METHODS: We analysed malaria cases reported in Australia from 2012 to 2022 using National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) data. Molecular data on imported malaria cases were obtained from literature searches. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2022, 3204 malaria cases were reported in Australia. Most cases (69%) were male and 44% occurred in young adults aged 20-39 years. Incidence rates initially declined between 2012 and 2015, then increased until 2019. During 2012-2019, the incidence in travellers ranged from 1.34 to 7.71 per 100 000 trips. Cases were primarily acquired in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 1433; 45%), Oceania (n = 569; 18%) and Southern and Central Asia (n = 367; 12%). The most common countries of acquisition were Papua New Guinea (n = 474) and India (n = 277). P. falciparum accounted for 58% (1871/3204) of cases and was predominantly acquired in Sub-Saharan Africa, and P. vivax accounted for 32% (1016/3204), predominantly from Oceania and Asia. Molecular studies of imported malaria cases to Australia identified genetic mutations and deletions associated with drug resistance and false-negative rapid diagnostic test results, and led to the establishment of reference genomes for P. vivax and P. malariae. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis highlights the continuing burden of imported malaria into Australia. Molecular studies have offered valuable insights into drug resistance and diagnostic limitations, and established reference genomes. Integrating molecular data into national surveillance systems could provide important infectious disease intelligence to optimise treatment guidelines for returning travellers and support endemic country surveillance programs.

Author: ['Ethier O', 'Chan HO', 'Abdolahnejad M', 'Morzycki A', 'Tchango AF', 'Joshi R', 'Wong JN', 'Hong C']
Journal Title: Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: Burn care management includes assessing the severity of burns accurately, especially distinguishing superficial partial thickness (SPT) burns from deep partial thickness (DPT) burns, in the context of providing definitive, downstream treatment. Moreover, the healing of the wound in the sub-acute care setting requires continuous tracking to avoid complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) provide a unique opportunity to build low-cost and accessible tools to classify burn severity and track changes of wound parameters, both in the clinic by physicians and nurses, and asynchronously in the remote setting by the patient themselves. Wound assessments can be achieved by AI-CV using the principles of Image-Guided Therapy (IGT) using high-quality 2D colour images. Wound parameters can include wound 2D spatial dimension and the characterization of wound colour changes which demonstrates physiological changes such as presentation of eschar/necrotic tissue, pustulence, granulation tissue and scabbing. Here we present the development of AI-CV-based Skin Abnormality Tracking Algorithm (SATA) pipeline. Additionally, we provide the results on a single localized burn tracked for a 6-week period in clinic, and an additional 2-week period of home monitoring.

Author: ['Lee JC', 'Hamill CS', 'Shnayder Y', 'Buczek E', 'Kakarala K', 'Bur AM']
Journal Title: The Laryngoscope
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in preoperative counseling for patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Survey Study. SETTING: Single institution tertiary care center. METHODS: ChatGPT was used to generate presurgical educational information including indications, risks, and recovery time for five common head and neck surgeries. Chatbot-generated information was compared with information gathered from a simple browser search (first publicly available website excluding scholarly articles). The accuracy of the information, readability, thoroughness, and number of errors were compared by five experienced head and neck surgeons in a blinded fashion. Each surgeon then chose a preference between the two information sources for each surgery. RESULTS: With the exception of total word count, ChatGPT-generated pre-surgical information has similar readability, content of knowledge, accuracy, thoroughness, and numbers of medical errors when compared to publicly available websites. Additionally, ChatGPT was preferred 48% of the time by experienced head and neck surgeons. CONCLUSION: Head and neck surgeons rated ChatGPT-generated and readily available online educational materials similarly. Further refinement in AI technology may soon open more avenues for patient counseling. Future investigations into the medical safety of AI counseling and exploring patients' perspectives would be of strong interest. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A. Laryngoscope, 2023.

Title: Facial dysmorphology in children exposed in pregnancy to anticonvulsant medications correlates with deficits in IQ.
Author: ['Holmes LB', 'Hunt AT', 'Will LA', 'Dhillon R', 'Deutsch C', 'Adams J']
Journal Title: American journal of medical genetics. Part A
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: Some children exposed at conception to the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), and carbamazepine (CBZ) have changes in their midface and fingers. It has been suggested that the anticonvulsant-exposed child with these subtle changes in facial features (the "anticonvulsant face") has a greater likelihood of having deficits in IQ in comparison with children exposed to the same anticonvulsants who do not have these features. 115 AED-exposed children (40, PHT; 34, PB; and 41, CBZ) between 6.5 and 16 years of age and 111 unexposed children matched by sex, race, and year in school were evaluated. The evaluations were (WISC-III), physical examination with measurements of facial features and digits and photographs. The AED-exposed children had cephalometric radiographs, but not the unexposed. Each parent had a similar examination of face and hands plus tests of intelligence. These AED-exposed children showed an increased frequency of a short nose and anteverted nares, features of the "anticonvulsant face." Lateral skull radiographs showed a decrease in the angle between the anterior cranial base and nasal bone, which produces anteverted nares. Mean IQs were significantly lower on one or more IQ measures for the children with these facial features. Shortening of the distal phalanges and small fingernails correlated with the presence of a short nose in that child. The findings in 115 children exposed at conception to either phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine, as monotherapy, confirmed the hypothesis that those with a short nose and anteverted nares had a lower IQ than exposed children without those features.

Author: ['Al-Tohamy A', 'Grove A']
Journal Title: Transcription
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: The rising threat of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria emphasizes the need for new therapeutic strategies. This review focuses on bacterial transcription factors (TFs), which play crucial roles in bacterial pathogenesis. We discuss the regulatory roles of these factors through examples, and we outline potential therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial TFs. Specifically, we discuss the use of small molecules to interfere with TF function and the development of transcription factor decoys, oligonucleotides that compete with promoters for TF binding. We also cover peptides that target the interaction between the bacterial TF and other factors, such as RNA polymerase, and the targeting of sigma factors. These strategies, while promising, come with challenges, from identifying targets to designing interventions, managing side effects, and accounting for changing bacterial resistance patterns. We also delve into how Artificial Intelligence contributes to these efforts and how it may be exploited in the future, and we touch on the roles of multidisciplinary collaboration and policy to advance this research domain.Abbreviations: AI, artificial intelligence; CNN, convolutional neural networks; DTI: drug-target interaction; HTH, helix-turn-helix; IHF, integration host factor; LTTRs, LysR-type transcriptional regulators; MarR, multiple antibiotic resistance regulator; MRSA, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSA: multiple sequence alignment; NAP, nucleoid-associated protein; PROTACs, proteolysis targeting chimeras; RNAP, RNA polymerase; TF, transcription factor; TFD, transcription factor decoying; TFTRs, TetR-family transcriptional regulators; wHTH, winged helix-turn-helix.

Abstract: The role of coronary CT angiography for the diagnosis and risk stratification of coronary artery disease is well established. However, its potential beyond the diagnostic phase remains to be determined. The current review focuses on the insights that coronary CT angiography can provide when planning and performing percutaneous coronary interventions. We describe a novel approach incorporating anatomical and functional pre-procedural planning enhanced by artificial intelligence, computational physiology and online 3D CT guidance for percutaneous coronary interventions. This strategy allows the individualisation of patient selection, optimisation of the revascularisation strategy and effective use of resources.

Title: Are African academic women more emotionally intelligent than men? Exploring emotional intelligence, gender, and leadership in higher education.
Author: ['Asmamaw AT', 'Semela T']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: In recent years, organizational and management research has been reporting the presence of a systematic link between emotional intelligence (EI) and leadership effectiveness. Notwithstanding the practical significance, however, scholarly attention is far from adequate especially in the context of African higher education. Thus, taking Ethiopia as an example, this study investigates (a) gender differences in EI and (b) the relationship between EI and leadership style among leaders in selected higher education institutions. The study was conducted on 210 random samples of academic leaders (135 men and 75 women). Data was generated using an adapted measure Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) to assess leaders' emotional intelligence (EI), while the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5x) was used to measure leadership styles. The findings show a strong positive relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership, but no relationship was found between EI and transactional leadership. On the other hand, a significant negative correlation was found between laissez-faire leadership and leaders' total EI scores. Furthermore, the study finds significant gender differences in emotional intelligence, with female leaders scoring higher in overall emotional intelligence and most of the EI components. These findings suggest that EI is the female leadership advantage. We strongly advise university administrators and policymakers to incorporate EI as a criterion for the recruitment, selection, and promotion of academic leaders to close the gender gap in higher education leadership.

Title: Visual image design of the internet of things based on AI intelligence.
Author: ['Tian T']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Visual object detection has emerged as a critical technology for Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) use due to advances in computer vision. New developments in fields like communication technology and the UAV needs to be able to act autonomously by gathering data and then making choices. These tendencies have brought us to cutting-edge levels of health care, transportation, energy, monitoring, and security for visual image detection and manufacturing endeavors. These include coordination in communication via IoT, sustainability of IoT network, and optimization challenges in path planning. Because of their limited battery life, these gadgets are limited in their range of communication. UAVs can be seen as terminal devices connected to a large network where a swarm of other UAVs is coordinating their motions, directing one another, and maintaining watch over locations outside its visual range. One of the essential components of UAV-based applications is the ability to recognize objects of interest in aerial photographs taken by UAVs. While aerial photos might be useful, object detection is challenging. As a result, capturing aerial photographs with UAVs is a unique challenge since the size of things in these images might vary greatly. The study proposal included specific information regarding the Detection of Visual Images by UAVs (DVI-UAV) using the IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Included in the study of AI is the concept of DSYolov3. The DSYolov3 model was presented to deal with these problems in the UAV industry. By fusing the channel-wise feature across multiple scales using a spatial pyramid pooling approach, the proposed study creates a novel module, Multi-scale Fusion of Channel Attention (MFCAM), for scale-variant object identification tasks. The method's effectiveness and efficiency have been thoroughly tested and evaluated experimentally. The suggested method would allow us to outperform most current detectors and guarantee that the models will be useable on UAVs. There will be a 95 % success rate in terms of visual image detection, a 94 % success rate in terms of computation cost, a 97 % success rate in terms of accuracy, and a 95 % success rate in terms of effectiveness.

Title: Deep learning-assisted IoMT framework for cerebral microbleed detection.
Author: ['Ali Z', 'Naz S', 'Yasmin S', 'Bukhari M', 'Kim M']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) are all key technologies that influence the formation and implementation of digital medical services. Building Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems that combine advanced sensors with AI-powered insights is critical for intelligent medical systems. This paper presents an IoMT framework for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis to lessen the unavoidable diagnosis and therapy faults that occur in human clinical settings for the accurate detection of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). The problems in accurate CMB detection include that CMBs are tiny dots 5-10 mm in diameter; they are similar to healthy tissues and are exceedingly difficult to identify, necessitating specialist guidance in remote and underdeveloped medical centers. Secondly, in the existing studies, computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems are designed for accurate CMB detection, however, their proposed approaches consist of two stages. Potential candidate CMBs from the complete MRI image are selected in the first stage and then passed to the phase of false-positive reduction. These pre-and post-processing steps make it difficult to build a completely automated CAD system for CMB that can produce results without human intervention. Hence, as a key goal of this work, an end-to-end enhanced UNet-based model for effective CMB detection and segmentation for IoMT devices is proposed. The proposed system requires no pre-processing or post-processing steps for CMB segmentation, and no existing research localizes each CMB pixel from the complete MRI image input. The findings indicate that the suggested method outperforms in detecting CMBs in the presence of contrast variations and similarities with other normal tissues and yields a good dice score of 0.70, an accuracy of 99 %, as well as a false-positive rate of 0.002 %.

Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Over the decades, agri-food security has become one of the most critical concerns in the world. Sustainable agri-food production technologies have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production. This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA. This review paper can open new directions to speed up the DA application on the farm and link traditional agriculture with modern farming technologies.

Abstract: Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly emerging field in medicine and has applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostication in various malignancies. The present study was conducted to analyze and compare the accuracy of three deep learning neural networks for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) images. Materials and methods Three hundred and twenty-five cases of OSCC were included and graded histologically by two grading systems. The images were then analyzed using the Orange data mining tool. Three neural networks, viz., InceptionV3, SqueezeNet, and VGG16, were used for further analysis and classification. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, specificity, sensitivity, area under curve (AUC), and accuracy were estimated for each neural network. Results Histological grading by Bryne's yielded significantly stronger inter-observer agreement. The highest accuracy was found for the classification of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma images irrespective of the network used. Other values were variegated. Conclusion AI could serve as an adjunct for improvement in theragnostics. Further research is required to achieve the modification of mining tools for greater predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, and security. Bryne's grading system is warranted for the better application of AI in OSCC image analytics.

Title: BiTCAN: A emotion recognition network based on saliency in brain cognition.
Author: ['An Y', 'Hu S', 'Liu S', 'Li B']
Journal Title: Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 5
Abstract: In recent years, with the continuous development of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces, emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become a prosperous research direction. Due to saliency in brain cognition, we construct a new spatio-temporal convolutional attention network for emotion recognition named BiTCAN. First, in the proposed method, the original EEG signals are de-baselined, and the two-dimensional mapping matrix sequence of EEG signals is constructed by combining the electrode position. Second, on the basis of the two-dimensional mapping matrix sequence, the features of saliency in brain cognition are extracted by using the Bi-hemisphere discrepancy module, and the spatio-temporal features of EEG signals are captured by using the 3-D convolution module. Finally, the saliency features and spatio-temporal features are fused into the attention module to further obtain the internal spatial relationships between brain regions, and which are input into the classifier for emotion recognition. Many experiments on DEAP and SEED (two public datasets) show that the accuracies of the proposed algorithm on both are higher than 97%, which is superior to most existing emotion recognition algorithms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are becoming increasingly popular. In this bibliometric study, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of publications relevant to the research of AI in RA, thereby developing a thorough overview of this research topic. Web of Science was used to retrieve publications on the application of AI in RA from 2003 to 2022. Bibliometric analysis and visualization were performed using Microsoft Excel (2019), R software (4.2.2) and VOSviewer (1.6.18). The overall distribution of yearly outputs, leading countries, top institutions and authors, active journals, co-cited references and keywords were analyzed. A total of 859 relevant articles were identified in the Web of Science with an increasing trend. USA and China were the leading countries in this field, accounting for 71.59% of publications in total. Harvard University was the most influential institution. Arthritis Research & Therapy was the most active journal. Primary topics in this field focused on estimating the risk of developing RA, diagnosing RA using sensor, clinical, imaging and omics data, identifying the phenotype of RA patients using electronic health records, predicting treatment response, tracking the progression of the disease and predicting prognosis and developing new drugs. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms were the recent research hotspots and trends in this field. AI has potential applications in various fields of RA, including the risk assessment, screening, early diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis determination, achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes and new drug development for RA patients. Incorporating machine learning and deep learning algorithms into real-world clinical practice will be a future research hotspot and trend for AI in RA. Extensive collaboration to improve model maturity and robustness will be a critical step in the advancement of AI in healthcare.

Title: European Health Union: An emergent reality.
Author: ['Fronteira I', 'Magalhaes JP', 'Ferrinho P']
Journal Title: The International journal of health planning and management
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: In this article we argue that the Member States of the European Union (EU) have consistently, since its inception, developed a shared framework to measure, monitor and intervene to improve the health status of its population, while invoking the subsidiarity principle for the health sector. As a result, a European Health Union (EHU) has been emerging insidiously and consistently, following the concept of a system for health. Using the World Health Organisation Building Blocks Framework, we analyse the normative and institutional developments related to EU citizens' health that have created a de facto EHU. Developments towards an EHU remain unequally distributed among the different building blocks analysed. The existing EHU is the result of a fragmented and incremental process, mostly grounded in governance, health intelligence and services' development. Health crisis, the Commission's agenda-setting activities and market pressures have been the most important push factors for these step-by-step processes.
