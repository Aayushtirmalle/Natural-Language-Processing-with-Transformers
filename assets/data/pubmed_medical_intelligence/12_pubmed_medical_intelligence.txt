Journal Title: The Journal of surgical research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, racial disparities persist. The primary aims of the study were to: evaluate differences in molecular testing rates over time by race; and measure the incidence of tumor mutations by race in patients with metastatic CRC. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of all adult patients with stage IV CRC (2008-2018) identified within the cancer registry of a large regional health system. Demographic/clinical characteristics were collected through primary data abstraction of the electronic health record. Molecular profiling results were obtained directly from Caris Molecular Intelligence and electronic health record. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-three patients were included: 40.5% (n = 155) were Black and 59.5% (n = 228) were White. Significant increases were observed in microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS, and BRAF testing rates during the study period (P < 0.0001). The odds of testing over time increased more significantly in Black compared to White patients for MSI testing (White: odds ratio [OR] 1.26 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.41], Black: OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.41-2.02], P = 0.005) and BRAF testing (White: OR 1.42 [95% CI 1.26-1.62], Black: OR 1.89 [95% CI 1.51-2.36], P = 0.027). An increase in KRAS testing over time was observed for both cohorts and was independent of race (P = 0.58). Mutation rates did not differ by race: KRAS (Black 55.8% versus White 45.6%, P = 0.13) and BRAF (Black 4.8% versus White 10.0%, P = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Within a large regional health system, molecular testing rates in patients with metastatic CRC increased significantly following National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline changes for both Black and White patients. Black and White patients who underwent molecular testing had similar rates of MSI, KRAS, and BRAF mutations.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysms are often identified and characterized on non-invasive CT Angiography (CTA) images, but digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for aneurysm evaluation. OBJECTIVE: We compared cerebral aneurysm size measurements as measured from CTA processed by a semi-automated artificial intelligence software program (RAPID Aneurysm) and three-dimensional rotational DSA (3D-DSA). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with a cerebral aneurysm who underwent CTA and DSA with 3D reformations. CTA images were processed by RAPID Aneurysm to determine aneurysm height, width, and neck width. The reference standard was aneurysm measurements on 3D-DSA as measured by two neurointerventionalists. Both readers were blinded to RAPID Aneurysm measurements. Correlation and bias between these measurements were determined. RESULTS: Results from 50 patients with 50 aneurysms were compared. 32 patients (64%) were female. Median age was 65 (IQR: 56.25-71.75). 37 patients (74%) presented with ruptured aneurysms. The aneurysms represented a range of aneurysm sizes (1.9-33.3 mm; IQR 3.6-7.2 mm). RAPID Aneurysm size measurements showed excellent correlation and low bias (correlation, mean difference) when compared to the reference standard for aneurysm height (0.98, -0.9 mm), width (0.98, 0.1 mm), and neck width (0.94, 1.1 mm). The inter-reader comparison between the two neurointerventionalists was similarly excellent for aneurysm height (0.97, -0.4 mm), width (0.98, -0.2 mm), and neck width (0.89, 0.8 mm). CONCLUSION: RAPID Aneurysm measurement of cerebral aneurysm height, width, and neck width on CTA is strongly correlated to expert neurointerventionalist measurements on 3D-DSA.

Title: Emergent Applications of Machine Learning for Diagnosing and Managing Appendicitis: A State-of-the-Art Review.
Author: ['Bhandarkar S', 'Tsutsumi A', 'Schneider EB', 'Ong CS', 'Paredes L', 'Brackett A', 'Ahuja V']
Journal Title: Surgical infections
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: Background: Appendicitis is an inflammatory condition that requires timely and effective intervention. Despite being one of the most common surgically treated diseases, the condition is difficult to diagnose because of atypical presentations. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) imaging improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses, yet these tools bear the drawbacks of high operator dependency and radiation exposure, respectively. However, new artificial intelligence tools (such as machine learning) may be able to address these shortcomings. Methods: We conducted a state-of-the-art review to delineate the various use cases of emerging machine learning algorithms for diagnosing and managing appendicitis in recent literature. The query ("Appendectomy" OR "Appendicitis") AND ("Machine Learning" OR "Artificial Intelligence") was searched across three databases for publications ranging from 2012 to 2022. Upon filtering for duplicates and based on our predefined inclusion criteria, 39 relevant studies were identified. Results: The algorithms used in these studies performed with an average accuracy of 86% (18/39), a sensitivity of 81% (16/39), a specificity of 75% (16/39), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.82 (15/39) where reported. Based on accuracy alone, the optimal model was logistic regression in 18% of studies, an artificial neural network in 15%, a random forest in 13%, and a support vector machine in 10%. Conclusions: The identified studies suggest that machine learning may provide a novel solution for diagnosing appendicitis and preparing for patient-specific post-operative complications. However, further studies are warranted to assess the feasibility and advisability of implementing machine learning-based tools in clinical practice.

Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB) presents a complex challenge in pregnancy, often leading to significant perinatal and long-term morbidities. "While machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown promise in PTB prediction, the lack of interpretability in existing models hinders their clinical utility. This study aimed to predict PTB in a pregnant population using ML models, identify the key risk factors associated with PTB through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and provide comprehensive explanations for these predictions to assist clinicians in providing appropriate care. This study analyzed a dataset of 3509 pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates and selected 35 risk factors associated with PTB based on the existing medical and artificial intelligence literature. Six ML algorithms were tested, wherein the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, with an area under the operator receiving curves of 0.735 and 0.723 for parous and nulliparous women, respectively. The SHAP feature attribution framework was employed to identify the most significant risk factors linked to PTB. Additionally, individual patient analysis was performed using the SHAP and the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation algorithms (LIME). The overall incidence of PTB was 11.23% (11 and 12.1% in parous and nulliparous women, respectively). The main risk factors associated with PTB in parous women are previous PTB, previous cesarean section, preeclampsia during pregnancy, and maternal age. In nulliparous women, body mass index at delivery, maternal age, and the presence of amniotic infection were the most relevant risk factors. The trained ML prediction model developed in this study holds promise as a valuable screening tool for predicting PTB within this specific population. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME analyses can assist clinicians in understanding the individualized impact of each risk factor on their patients and provide appropriate care to reduce morbidity and mortality related to PTB.

Title: Development of a robust daily soil temperature estimation in semi-arid continental climate using meteorological predictors based on computational intelligent paradigms.
Author: ['Alizamir M', 'Ahmed KO', 'Kim S', 'Heddam S', 'Gorgij AD', 'Chang SW']
Journal Title: PloS one
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Changes in soil temperature (ST) play an important role in the main mechanisms within the soil, including biological and chemical activities. For instance, they affect the microbial community composition, the speed at which soil organic matter breaks down and becomes minerals. Moreover, the growth and physiological activity of plants are directly influenced by the ST. Additionally, ST indirectly affects plant growth by influencing the accessibility of nutrients in the soil. Therefore, designing an efficient tool for ST estimating at different depths is useful for soil studies by considering meteorological parameters as input parameters, maximal air temperature, minimal air temperature, maximal air relative humidity, minimal air relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. This investigation employed various statistical metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the implemented models. These metrics encompassed the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency, and mean absolute error (MAE). Hence, this study presented several artificial intelligence-based models, MLPANN, SVR, RFR, and GPR for building robust predictive tools for daily scale ST estimation at 05, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100cm soil depths. The suggested models are evaluated at two meteorological stations (i.e., Sulaimani and Dukan) located in Kurdistan region, Iraq. Based on assessment of outcomes of this study, the suggested models exhibited exceptional predictive capabilities and comparison of the results showed that among the proposed frameworks, GPR yielded the best results for 05, 10, 20, and 100cm soil depths, with RMSE values of 1.814 degrees C, 1.652 degrees C, 1.773 degrees C, and 2.891 degrees C, respectively. Also, for 50cm soil depth, MLPANN performed the best with an RMSE of 2.289 degrees C at Sulaimani station using the RMSE during the validation phase. Furthermore, GPR produced the most superior outcomes for 10cm, 30cm, and 50cm soil depths, with RMSE values of 1.753 degrees C, 2.270 degrees C, and 2.631 degrees C, respectively. In addition, for 05cm soil depth, SVR achieved the highest level of performance with an RMSE of 1.950 degrees C at Dukan station. The results obtained in this research confirmed that the suggested models have the potential to be effectively used as daily predictive tools at different stations and various depths.

Title: SkinViT: A transformer based method for Melanoma and Nonmelanoma classification.
Author: ['Khan S', 'Khan A']
Journal Title: PloS one
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Over the past few decades, skin cancer has emerged as a major global health concern. The efficacy of skin cancer treatment greatly depends upon early diagnosis and effective treatment. The automated classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma is quite challenging task due to presence of high visual similarities across different classes and variabilities within each class. According to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma utilising Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) under the Nonmelanoma class for the first time. Therefore, this research focuses on automated detection of different skin cancer types to provide assistance to the dermatologists in timely diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma patients. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have gained popularity where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to accurately classify various skin diseases. However, CNN has limitation in its ability to capture global contextual information which may lead to missing important information. In order to address this issue, this research explores the outlook attention mechanism inspired by vision outlooker, which improves important features while suppressing noisy features. The proposed SkinViT architecture integrates an outlooker block, transformer block and MLP head block to efficiently capture both fine level and global features in order to enhance the accuracy of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma classification. The proposed SkinViT method is assessed by different performance metrics such as recall, precision, classification accuracy, and F1 score. We performed extensive experiments on three datasets, Dataset1 which is extracted from ISIC2019, Dataset2 collected from various online dermatological database and Dataset3 combines both datasets. The proposed SkinViT achieved 0.9109 accuracy on Dataset1, 0.8911 accuracy on Dataset3 and 0.8611 accuracy on Dataset2. Moreover, the proposed SkinViT method outperformed other SOTA models and displayed higher accuracy compared to the previous work in the literature. The proposed method demonstrated higher performance efficiency in classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma dermoscopic images. This work is expected to inspire further research in implementing a system for detecting skin cancer that can assist dermatologists in timely diagnosing Melanoma and Nonmelanoma patients.

Title: Adaptive Cross-Feature Fusion Network With Inconsistency Guidance for Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation.
Author: ['Yue G', 'Zhuo G', 'Zhou T', 'Liu W', 'Wang T', 'Jiang Q']
Journal Title: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: In the context of contemporary artificial intelligence, increasing deep learning (DL) based segmentation methods have been recently proposed for brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) via analysis of multi-modal MRI. However, known DL-based works usually directly fuse the information of different modalities at multiple stages without considering the gap between modalities, leaving much room for performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep neural network, termed ACFNet, for accurately segmenting brain tumor in multi-modal MRI. Specifically, ACFNet has a parallel structure with three encoder-decoder streams. The upper and lower streams generate coarse predictions from individual modality, while the middle stream integrates the complementary knowledge of different modalities and bridges the gap between them to yield fine prediction. To effectively integrate the complementary information, we propose an adaptive cross-feature fusion (ACF) module at the encoder that first explores the correlation information between the feature representations from upper and lower streams and then refines the fused correlation information. To bridge the gap between the information from multi-modal data, we propose a prediction inconsistency guidance (PIG) module at the decoder that helps the network focus more on error-prone regions through a guidance strategy when incorporating the features from the encoder. The guidance is obtained by calculating the prediction inconsistency between upper and lower streams and highlights the gap between multi-modal data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset show that ACFNet is competent for the BraTS task with promising results and outperforms six mainstream competing methods.

Title: Artificial intelligence model predicting postoperative pain using facial expressions: a pilot study.
Author: ['Park I', 'Park JH', 'Yoon J', 'Song IA', 'Na HS', 'Ryu JH', 'Oh AY']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical monitoring and computing
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess whether an artificial intelligence model based on facial expressions can accurately predict significant postoperative pain. METHODS: A total of 155 facial expressions from patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery were analyzed to extract facial action units (AUs), gaze, landmarks, and positions. These features were used to construct various machine learning (ML) models, designed to predict significant postoperative pain intensity (NRS >/= 7) from less significant pain (NRS < 7). Significant AUs predictive of NRS >/= 7 were determined and compared to AUs known to be associated with pain in awake patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the ML models was calculated and compared using DeLong's test. RESULTS: AU17 (chin raising) and AU20 (lip stretching) were found to be associated with NRS >/= 7 (both P </= 0.004). AUs known to be associated with pain in awake patients did not show an association with pain in postoperative patients. An ML model based on AU17 and AU20 demonstrated an AUROC of 0.62 for NRS >/= 7, which was inferior to a model based on all AUs (AUROC = 0.81, P = 0.006). Among facial features, head position and facial landmarks proved to be better predictors of NRS >/= 7 (AUROC, 0.85-0.96) than AUs. A merged ML model that utilized gaze and eye landmarks, as well as head position and facial landmarks, exhibited the best performance (AUROC, 0.90) in predicting significant postoperative pain. CONCLUSION: ML models using facial expressions can accurately predict the presence of significant postoperative pain and have the potential to screen patients in need of rescue analgesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05477303; date: June 17, 2022).

Journal Title: European radiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess undergraduate medical students' knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. METHODS: A multi-national, multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2022, targeting undergraduate medical students in nine Arab countries. The study utilized a web-based questionnaire, with data collection carried out with the help of national leaders and local collaborators. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of knowledge, attitude, and perception among the participants. Additionally, cluster analysis was employed to identify shared patterns within their responses. RESULTS: Of the 4492 students surveyed, 92.4% had not received formal AI training. Regarding AI and deep learning (DL), 87.1% exhibited a low level of knowledge. Most students (84.9%) believed AI would revolutionize medicine and radiology, with 48.9% agreeing that it could reduce the need for radiologists. Students with high/moderate AI knowledge and training had higher odds of agreeing to endorse AI replacing radiologists, reducing their numbers, and being less likely to consider radiology as a career compared to those with low knowledge/no AI training. Additionally, the majority agreed that AI would aid in the automated detection and diagnosis of pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Arab medical students exhibit a notable deficit in their knowledge and training pertaining to AI. Despite this, they hold a positive perception of AI implementation in medicine and radiology, demonstrating a clear understanding of its significance for the healthcare system and medical curriculum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This study highlights the need for widespread education and training in artificial intelligence for Arab medical students, indicating its significance for healthcare systems and medical curricula. KEY POINTS: * Arab medical students demonstrate a significant knowledge and training gap when it comes to using AI in the fields of medicine and radiology. * Arab medical students recognize the importance of integrating AI into the medical curriculum. Students with a deeper understanding of AI were more likely to agree that all medical students should receive AI education. However, those with previous AI training were less supportive of this idea. * Students with moderate/high AI knowledge and training displayed increased odds of agreeing that AI has the potential to replace radiologists, reduce the demand for their services, and were less inclined to pursue a career in radiology, when compared to students with low knowledge/no AI training.

Abstract: mAbs are highly indispensable tools for diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic applications. The first technique, hybridoma technology, was based on fusion of B lymphocytes with myeloma cells, which resulted in generation of single mAbs against a specific Ag. Along with hybridoma technology, several novel and alternative methods have been developed to improve mAb generation, ranging from electrofusion to the discovery of completely novel technologies such as B cell immortalization; phage, yeast, bacterial, ribosome, and mammalian display systems; DNA/RNA encoded Abs; single B cell technology; transgenic animals; and artificial intelligence/machine learning. This commentary outlines the evolution, methodology, advantages, and limitations of various mAb production techniques. Furthermore, with the advent of next-generation Ab technologies such as single-chain variable fragments, nanobodies, bispecific Abs, Fc-engineered Abs, Ab biosimilars, Ab mimetics, and Ab-drug conjugates, the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors have become resourceful to develop highly specific mAb treatments against various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune and infectious diseases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: A session at the 2023 International Consultation on Incontinence - Research Society (ICI-RS) held in Bristol, UK, focused on the question: Is the time right for a new initiative in mathematical modeling of the lower urinary tract (LUT)? The LUT is a complex system, comprising various synergetic components (i.e., bladder, urethra, neural control), each with its own dynamic functioning and high interindividual variability. This has led to a variety of different types of models for different purposes, each with advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: When addressing the LUT, the modeling approach should be selected and sized according to the specific purpose, the targeted level of detail, and the available computational resources. Four areas were selected as examples to discuss: utility of nomograms in clinical use, value of fluid mechanical modeling, applications of models to simplify urodynamics, and utility of statistical models. RESULTS: A brief literature review is provided along with discussion of the merits of different types of models for different applications. Remaining research questions are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequacies in current (outdated) models of the LUT as well as recent advances in computing power (e.g., quantum computing) and methods (e.g., artificial intelligence/machine learning), would dictate that the answer is an emphatic "Yes, the time is right for a new initiative in mathematical modeling of the LUT."

Title: Identifying Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy: A New Perspective from Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Author: ['Wang Y', 'Yang L', 'Shang Y', 'Huang Y', 'Ju C', 'Zheng H', 'Zhao W', 'Liu J']
Journal Title: Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: Type C hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a condition characterized by brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal-systemic blood shunting, which manifests as a broad spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from minimal HE (MHE), detectable only by neuropsychological or neurophysiological assessment, to coma. Though MHE is the subclinical phase of HE, it is highly prevalent in cirrhotic patients and strongly associated with poor quality of life, high risk of overt HE, and mortality. It is, therefore, critical to identify MHE at the earliest and timely intervene, thereby minimizing the subsequent complications and costs. However, proper and sensitive diagnosis of MHE is hampered by its unnoticeable symptoms and the absence of standard diagnostic criteria. A variety of neuropsychological or neurophysiological tests have been performed to diagnose MHE. However, these tests are nonspecific and susceptible to multiple factors (eg, aging, education), thereby limiting their application in clinical practice. Thus, developing an objective, effective, and noninvasive method is imperative to help detect MHE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive technique which can produce many objective biomarkers by different imaging sequences (eg, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, DWI, rs-MRI, and arterial spin labeling), has recently shown the ability to screen MHE from NHE (non-HE) patients accurately. As advanced MRI techniques continue to emerge, more minor changes in the brain could be captured, providing new means for early diagnosis and quantitative assessment of MHE. In addition, the advancement of artificial intelligence in medical imaging also presents the potential to mine more effective diagnostic biomarkers and further improves the predictive efficiency of MHE. Taken together, advanced MRI techniques may provide a new perspective for us to identify MHE in the future. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

Title: Detection of sessile serrated adenoma using artificial intelligence-enhanced endoscopy: an Asian perspective.
Author: ['Soo JM', 'Koh FH']
Journal Title: ANZ journal of surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: BACKGROUND: As the serrated pathway has gained prominence as an alternative colorectal carcinogenesis pathway, sessile serrated adenomas or polyps (SSA/P) have been highlighted as lesions to rule out during colonoscopy. These lesions are however morphologically difficult to detect on endoscopy and can be mistaken for hyperplastic polyps due to similar endoscopic features. With the underlying nature of rapid progression and malignant transformation, interval cancer is a likely consequence of undetected or overlooked SSA/P. Real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy via the computer-assisted detection system (CADe) is an increasingly useful tool in improving adenoma detection rate by providing a second eye during the procedure. In this article, we describe a guide through a video to illustrate the detection of SSA/P during AI-assisted colonoscopy. METHODS: Consultant-grade endoscopists utilized real-time AI-assisted colonoscopy device, as part of a larger prospective study, to detect suspicious lesions which were later histopathologically confirmed to be SSA/P. RESULTS: All lesions were picked up by the CADe where a real-time green box highlighted suspicious polyps to the clinician. Three SSA/P of varying morphology are described with reference to classical SSA/P features and with comparison to the features of the hyperplastic polyp found in our study. All three SSA/P observed are in keeping with the JNET Classification (Type 1). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CADe is a most useful aid to clinicians during endoscopy in the detection of SSA/P but must be complemented with factors such as good endoscopy skill and bowel prep for effective detection, and biopsy coupled with subsequent accurate histological diagnosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Fifty per cent of patients with cancer require radiotherapy during their disease course, however, only 10%-40% of patients in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have access to it. A shortfall in specialised workforce has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software has been developed to automate both the delineation of anatomical target structures and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy. METHODS: ARCHERY is a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of AI-based automated radiotherapy treatment planning for cervical, head and neck, and prostate cancers, which are endemic in LMICs, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 990 patients (330 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures using the time-driven activity-based costing model. The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n=2), Jordan (n=1), Malaysia (n=1) and South Africa (n=2) to support implementation of the software in LMICs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval from University College London (UCL) and each of the six study sites. If the study objectives are met, the AI-based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to public sector state hospitals in LMICs to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving access to and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control. Public and policy engagement plans will involve patients as key partners.

Abstract: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is not only one of the most fatal forms of tuberculosis, but also a major public health concern worldwide, presenting grave clinical challenges due to its nonspecific symptoms and the urgent need for timely intervention. The severity and the rapid progression of TBM underscore the necessity of early and accurate diagnosis to prevent irreversible neurological deficits and reduce mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant primarily on clinical findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, often falter in delivering timely and conclusive results. Moreover, such methods struggle to distinguish TBM from other forms of neuroinfections, making it critical to seek advanced diagnostic solutions. Against this backdrop, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as an indispensable modality in diagnostics, owing to its unique advantages. This review provides an overview of the advancements in MRI technology, specifically emphasizing its crucial applications in the early detection and identification of complex pathological changes in TBM. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has further enhanced the transformative impact of MRI on TBM diagnostic imaging. When these cutting-edge technologies synergize with deep learning algorithms, they substantially improve diagnostic precision and efficiency. Currently, the field of TBM imaging diagnosis is undergoing a phase of technological amalgamation. The melding of MRI and AI technologies unquestionably signals new opportunities in this specialized area.
