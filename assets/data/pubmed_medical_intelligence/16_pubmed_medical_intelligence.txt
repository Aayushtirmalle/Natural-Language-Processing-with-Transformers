Title: Assessing Learning of Computer Programming Skills in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence.
Author: ['Wilson S', 'Nishomoto M']
Journal Title: Journal of biomechanical engineering
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 23
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude have recently become a concern in the delivery of engineering education. For courses focused on computer coding, such tools are capable for creating working computer code across a range of computer languages and computing platforms. In a course for mechanical engineers focused on C++ coding for the Arduino microcontroller and coding engineering problems in Matlab, a new approach to assessment of programming homework assignments was developed. This assessment moved the focus of assigned points from the correctness of the code to the effort and understanding of the code demonstrated by the student during in-person grading. Students who participated fully in in-person grading did significantly better on a midterm exam. Relative to a previous semester, where grading was focused on correct code, students had a slightly higher average midterm exam score. This approach appears to be effective in supporting computational learning in the face of evolving tools that could be used to circumvent learning. Future work should examine how to also encourage responsible use of generative AI in computational learning.

Title: Clinical use of digital applications for diagnostic and treatment planning in prosthodontics: A scoping review.
Author: ['Joda T', 'Balmer M', 'Jung RE', 'Ioannidis A']
Journal Title: Clinical oral implants research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: AIM: This scoping review aimed to compile and evaluate clinical trials investigating digital applications in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning by assessing their clinical relevance and future potential. METHODS: Following the PCC-framework for scoping reviews and combining the source of analysis (Population/P: "prosthodontics"), the technique of interest (Concept/C: "digital application") and the field of interest (Context/C: "diagnostics"), a three-pronged search strategy was applied in the database PubMed and Web of Science. Clinical trials (>/=10 study participants, English/German) were considered until 2023-03-09. Reporting adhered to the PRISMA-ScR statement. RESULTS: The search identified 520 titles, of which 18 full-texts met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. The trials involved a total of 14,457 study participants and were mapped for prosthetic subdisciplines: fixed (n = 9; 50%) and removable (n = 4; 22%) prosthodontics, reconstructive dentistry in general (n = 3; 17%), and temporo-mandibular joint disorders (n = 2; 11%). Data merging of medical format files, as DICOM+STL, was the dominant digital application (n = 7; 39%); and virtual treatment simulation using digital smile design or digital wax-up represented the most frequent prosthetic diagnostics (n = 6; 33%). CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified a relatively low number of clinical trials. The future potential of digital diagnostics appears to be mostly related to the subdiscipline of fixed prosthodontics, especially regarding virtual treatment simulation for communication with the patient and among dental professionals. Artificial intelligence emerged as a key technology in many of the identified studies. Further research in this area is needed to explore the capabilities of digital technologies in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning.

Journal Title: Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence, which combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning models to process human language. Although there is a surge in NLP usage across various industries in recent years, NLP has not been widely evaluated and utilized to support drug development. To demonstrate how advanced NLP can expedite the extraction and analyses of information to help address clinical pharmacology questions, inform clinical trial designs, and support drug development, three use cases are described in this article: 1) dose optimization strategy in oncology, 2) common covariates on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in oncology, and 3) physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) analyses for regulatory review and product label. The NLP workflow includes 1) preparation of source files, 2) NLP model building, and 3) automation of data extraction. The Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) documents, US package inserts (USPI), and approval letters from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were used as our source data. As demonstrated in the three example use cases, advanced NLP can expedite the extraction and analyses of large amounts of information from regulatory review documents to help address important clinical pharmacology questions. Though this has not been adopted widely, integrating advanced NLP into the clinical pharmacology workflow can increase efficiency in extracting impactful information to advance drug development.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: The objective of this study was to comprehend the efficiency of wheat regeneration, callus induction, and DNA methylation through the application of mathematical frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models. This research aimed to explore the impact of treatments with AgNO(3) and Ag-NPs on various parameters. The study specifically concentrated on analyzing RAPD profiles and modeling regeneration parameters. The treatments and molecular findings served as input variables in the modeling process. It included the use of AgNO(3) and Ag-NPs at different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg L(-1)). The in vitro and epigenetic characteristics were analyzed using several machine learning (ML) methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), and Gaussian processes classifier (GP) methods. This study's results revealed that the highest values for callus induction (CI%) and embryogenic callus induction (EC%) occurred at a concentration of 2 mg L(-1) of Ag-NPs. Additionally, the regeneration efficiency (RE) parameter reached its peak at a concentration of 8 mg L(-1) of AgNO(3). Taking an epigenetic approach, AgNO(3) at a concentration of 2 mg L(-1) demonstrated the highest levels of genomic template stability (GTS), at 79.3%. There was a positive correlation seen between increased levels of AgNO(3) and DNA hypermethylation. Conversely, elevated levels of Ag-NPs were associated with DNA hypomethylation. The models were used to estimate the relationships between the input elements, including treatments, concentration, GTS rates, and Msp I and Hpa II polymorphism, and the in vitro output parameters. The findings suggested that the XGBoost model exhibited superior performance scores for callus induction (CI), as evidenced by an R(2) score of 51.5%, which explained the variances. Additionally, the RF model explained 71.9% of the total variance and showed superior efficacy in terms of EC%. Furthermore, the GP model, which provided the most robust statistics for RE, yielded an R(2) value of 52.5%, signifying its ability to account for a substantial portion of the total variance present in the data. This study exemplifies the application of various machine learning models in the cultivation of mature wheat embryos under the influence of treatments and concentrations involving AgNO(3) and Ag-NPs.

Title: Enhancing Short Track Speed Skating Performance through Improved DDQN Tactical Decision Model.
Author: ['Yang Y', 'Li F', 'Chang H']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: This paper studies the tactical decision-making model of short track speed skating based on deep reinforcement learning, so as to improve the competitive performance of corresponding short track speed skaters. Short track speed skating, a traditional discipline in the Winter Olympics since its establishment in 1988, has consistently garnered attention. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, the utilization of deep learning methods to enhance athletes' tactical decision-making capabilities has become increasingly prevalent. Traditional tactical decision techniques often rely on the experience and knowledge of coaches and video analysis methods that require a lot of time and effort. Consequently, this study proposes a scientific simulation environment for short track speed skating, that accurately simulates the physical attributes of the venue, the physiological fitness of the athletes, and the rules of the competition. The Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model is enhanced and utilized, with improvements to the reward function and the distinct description of four tactics. This enables agents to learn optimal tactical decisions in various competitive states with a simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively enhances the competition performance and physiological fitness allocation of short track speed skaters.

Author: ['Mohammadi H', 'Thirunarayan K', 'Chen L']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: In the realm of intelligent sensor systems, the dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has heightened the importance of interpretability. This is particularly critical for opaque models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), as understanding their decisions is essential, not only for ethical and regulatory compliance, but also for fostering trust in AI-driven outcomes. This paper introduces the novel concept of a Computer Vision Interpretability Index (CVII). The CVII framework is designed to emulate human cognitive processes, specifically in tasks related to vision. It addresses the intricate challenge of quantifying interpretability, a task that is inherently subjective and varies across domains. The CVII is rigorously evaluated using a range of computer vision models applied to the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in the field. The findings established a robust correlation between image interpretability, model selection, and CVII scores. This research makes a substantial contribution to enhancing interpretability for human comprehension, as well as within intelligent sensor applications. By promoting transparency and reliability in AI-driven decision-making, the CVII framework empowers its stakeholders to effectively harness the full potential of AI technologies.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 16
Abstract: Epilepsy is a condition that affects 50 million individuals globally, significantly impacting their quality of life. Epileptic seizures, a transient occurrence, are characterized by a spectrum of manifestations, including alterations in motor function and consciousness. These events impose restrictions on the daily lives of those affected, frequently resulting in social isolation and psychological distress. In response, numerous efforts have been directed towards the detection and prevention of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis, employing machine learning and deep learning methodologies. This study presents a methodology that reduces the number of features and channels required by simpler classifiers, leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the detection of epileptic seizures. The proposed approach achieves performance metrics exceeding 95% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by utilizing merely six features and five channels in a temporal domain analysis, with a time window of 1 s. The model demonstrates robust generalization across the patient cohort included in the database, suggesting that feature reduction in simpler models-without resorting to deep learning-is adequate for seizure detection. The research underscores the potential for substantial reductions in the number of attributes and channels, advocating for the training of models with strategically selected electrodes, and thereby supporting the development of effective mobile applications for epileptic seizure detection.

Abstract: Simple sensor-based procedures, including auscultation and electrocardiography (ECG), can facilitate early diagnosis of valvular diseases, resulting in timely treatment. This study assessed the impact of combining these sensor-based procedures with machine learning on diagnosing valvular abnormalities and ventricular dysfunction. Data from auscultation at three distinct locations and 12-lead ECGs were collected from 1052 patients undergoing echocardiography. An independent cohort of 103 patients was used for clinical validation. These patients were screened for severe aortic stenosis (AS), severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) with ejection fractions </= 40%. Optimal neural networks were identified by a fourfold cross-validation training process using heart sounds and various ECG leads, and their outputs were combined using a stacking technique. This composite sensor model had high diagnostic efficiency (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values: AS, 0.93; MR, 0.80; LVD, 0.75). Notably, the contribution of individual sensors to disease detection was found to be disease-specific, underscoring the synergistic potential of the sensor fusion approach. Thus, machine learning models that integrate auscultation and ECG can efficiently detect conditions typically diagnosed via imaging. Moreover, this study highlights the potential of multimodal artificial intelligence applications.

Abstract: Accuracy validation of gait analysis using pose estimation with artificial intelligence (AI) remains inadequate, particularly in objective assessments of absolute error and similarity of waveform patterns. This study aimed to clarify objective measures for absolute error and waveform pattern similarity in gait analysis using pose estimation AI (OpenPose). Additionally, we investigated the feasibility of simultaneous measuring both lower limbs using a single camera from one side. We compared motion analysis data from pose estimation AI using video footage that was synchronized with a three-dimensional motion analysis device. The comparisons involved mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) to compare the waveform pattern similarity. The MAE ranged from 2.3 to 3.1 degrees  on the camera side and from 3.1 to 4.1 degrees  on the opposite side, with slightly higher accuracy on the camera side. Moreover, the CMC ranged from 0.936 to 0.994 on the camera side and from 0.890 to 0.988 on the opposite side, indicating a "very good to excellent" waveform similarity. Gait analysis using a single camera revealed that the precision on both sides was sufficiently robust for clinical evaluation, while measurement accuracy was slightly superior on the camera side.

Author: ['Arikan I', 'Ayav T', 'Seckin AC', 'Soygazi F']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the estrus period is crucial for optimizing insemination efficiency and reducing costs in animal husbandry, a vital sector for global food production. Precise estrus period determination is essential to avoid economic losses, such as milk production reductions, delayed calf births, and disqualification from government support. The proposed method integrates estrus period detection with cow identification using augmented reality (AR). It initiates deep learning-based mounting detection, followed by identifying the mounting region of interest (ROI) using YOLOv5. The ROI is then cropped with padding, and cow ID detection is executed using YOLOv5 on the cropped ROI. The system subsequently records the identified cow IDs. The proposed system accurately detects mounting behavior with 99% accuracy, identifies the ROI where mounting occurs with 98% accuracy, and detects the mounting couple with 94% accuracy. The high success of all operations with the proposed system demonstrates its potential contribution to AR and artificial intelligence applications in livestock farming.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: Human-robot interaction is of the utmost importance as it enables seamless collaboration and communication between humans and robots, leading to enhanced productivity and efficiency. It involves gathering data from humans, transmitting the data to a robot for execution, and providing feedback to the human. To perform complex tasks, such as robotic grasping and manipulation, which require both human intelligence and robotic capabilities, effective interaction modes are required. To address this issue, we use a wearable glove to collect relevant data from a human demonstrator for improved human-robot interaction. Accelerometer, pressure, and flexi sensors were embedded in the wearable glove to measure motion and force information for handling objects of different sizes, materials, and conditions. A machine learning algorithm is proposed to recognize grasp orientation and position, based on the multi-sensor fusion method.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: As technologies like the Internet, artificial intelligence, and big data evolve at a rapid pace, computer architecture is transitioning from compute-intensive to memory-intensive. However, traditional von Neumann architectures encounter bottlenecks in addressing modern computational challenges. The emulation of the behaviors of a synapse at the device level by ionic/electronic devices has shown promising potential in future neural-inspired and compact artificial intelligence systems. To address these issues, this review thoroughly investigates the recent progress in metal-oxide heterostructures for neuromorphic applications. These heterostructures not only offer low power consumption and high stability but also possess optimized electrical characteristics via interface engineering. The paper first outlines various synthesis methods for metal oxides and then summarizes the neuromorphic devices using these materials and their heterostructures. More importantly, we review the emerging multifunctional applications, including neuromorphic vision, touch, and pain systems. Finally, we summarize the future prospects of neuromorphic devices with metal-oxide heterostructures and list the current challenges while offering potential solutions. This review provides insights into the design and construction of metal-oxide devices and their applications for neuromorphic systems.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: Nowadays, there is an ever-growing interest in assessing the collective intelligence (CI) of a team in a wide range of scenarios, thanks to its potential in enhancing teamwork and group performance. Recently, special attention has been devoted on the clinical setting, where breakdowns in teamwork, leadership, and communication can lead to adverse events, compromising patient safety. So far, researchers have mostly relied on surveys to study human behavior and group dynamics; however, this method is ineffective. In contrast, a promising solution to monitor behavioral and individual features that are reflective of CI is represented by wearable technologies. To date, the field of CI assessment still appears unstructured; therefore, the aim of this narrative review is to provide a detailed overview of the main group and individual parameters that can be monitored to evaluate CI in clinical settings, together with the wearables either already used to assess them or that have the potential to be applied in this scenario. The working principles, advantages, and disadvantages of each device are introduced in order to try to bring order in this field and provide a guide for future CI investigations in medical contexts.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)

Abstract: Large-scale incorporation of new energy generation units based on renewable sources, such as wind and photovoltaic power, drastically alters the structure of the power system. Because of the intermittent nature of these sources, switching in grids (connection and disconnection) occurs much more frequently than with conventional sources. As a result, the power system will inevitably experience a large number of transients, which raises questions about the stability of the system and the quality of the electrical energy. Therefore, measuring various types of transients in power system is crucial for stability, power quality, fault analysis, protection design, and insulation design. Transient recorders that are currently used are generally expensive and only suitable for particular locations in power systems. The number of installed transient recorders is insufficient for a comprehensive analysis of problems that may occur. Hence, it is important to have inexpensive and efficient transient recorders that can be installed at multiple points in the power system on various types of objects. It is also essential to have a transient record database with open access, which can be used by researchers to develop new analysis techniques based on artificial intelligence. This paper proposes an inexpensive measurement and acquisition system designed to record transient phenomena on different objects within the power system. The system is designed to use autonomous power, a standardized data acquisition module, a low-budget system for transmitting recorded transient events to the server via mobile network, and a sensor system adapted to the object where transients are recorded. The proposed system is designed to be used for all types of objects in the power system where transients may occur, such as power lines, transmission towers, surge arresters, and transformers. All components of the system are described, and the system is tested under laboratory conditions. The modular nature of the system allows customization to the specifics of the location in power system by choosing appropriate components. The calibration method of the custom designed Rogowski coil is described. The cost analysis of the proposed system and power consumption analysis are performed. The results show that the system's performance meets application requirements at a low cost.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: Smart parking is an artificial intelligence-based solution to solve the challenges of inefficient utilization of parking slots, wasting time, congestion producing high CO(2) emission levels, inflexible payment methods, and protecting parked vehicles from theft and vandalism. Nothing is worse than parking congestion caused by drivers looking for open spaces. This is common in large parking lots, underground garages, and multi-story car parks, where visibility is limited and signage can be confusing or difficult to read, so drivers have no idea where available parking spaces are. In this paper, a smart real-time parking management system has been introduced. The developed system can deal with the aforementioned challenges by providing dynamic allocation for parking slots while taking into consideration the overall parking situation, providing a mechanism for booking a specific parking slot by using our Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based application, and providing a mechanism to ensure that the car is parked in its correct place. For the sake of providing cost flexibility, we have provided two technical solutions with cost varying. The first solution is developed based on a motion sensor and the second solution is based on a range-finder sensor. A plate detection and recognition system has been used to detect the vehicle's license plate by capturing the image using an IoT device. The system will recognize the extracted English alphabet and Hindu-Arabic Numerals. The proposed solution was built and field-tested to prove the applicability of the proposed smart parking solution. We have measured and analyzed keen data such as vehicle plate detection accuracy, vehicle plate recognition accuracy, transmission delay time, and processing delay time.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: This paper introduces the application of a genetic programming (GP)-based method for the automated design and tuning of process controllers, representing a noteworthy advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) within the realm of control engineering. In contrast to already existing work, our GP-based approach operates exclusively in the time domain, incorporating differential operations such as derivatives and integrals without necessitating intermediate inverse Laplace transformations. This unique feature not only simplifies the design process but also ensures the practical implementability of the generated controllers within physical systems. Notably, the GP's functional set extends beyond basic arithmetic operators to include a rich repertoire of mathematical operations, encompassing trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. This broad set of operations enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the GP-based approach in controller design. To rigorously assess the efficacy of our GP-based approach, we conducted an extensive series of tests to determine its limits and capabilities. In summary, our research establishes the GP-based approach as a promising solution for automating the controller design process, offering a transformative tool to address a spectrum of control problems across various engineering applications.
