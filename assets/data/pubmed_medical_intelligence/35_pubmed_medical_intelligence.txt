Title: [Guidelines for clinical trial protocols for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the SPIRIT-AI extensionDiretrizes para protocolos de ensaios clinicos com intervencoes que utilizam inteligencia artificial: a extensao SPIRIT-AI].
Author: ['Cruz Rivera S', 'Liu X', 'Chan AW', 'Denniston AK', 'Calvert MJ']
Journal Title: Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.

Title: Retinopathy of Prematurity in Late Preterm Twins with a Birth Weight Discordance: Can it be Predicted by Artificial Intelligence?
Author: ['Yenice EK', 'Kara C', 'Yenice M', 'Erdas CB']
Journal Title: Beyoglu eye journal
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objective is to predict the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in discordant twins using a machine learning approach. METHODS: The records of 640 twin pairs born at 32-35 weeks gestational age (GA) with birth weight (BW) discordance were evaluated retrospectively. The infants' gender, GA, postmenstruel age at examination, BW, discordance rate, ROP Stages and Zones, and treatment options were recorded. The variables were used to develop a model to predict the development of ROP. Machine learning models were used for algorithm training and 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was applied for validation. The main measures were reported as sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve. RESULTS: A total of 640 twin pairs underwent ophthalmic examination, of which 55 (4.3%) were ROP. The infants' GA was 33.56+/-1.01 weeks (32-35 weeks) and BW was 1996+/-335 g (1000-3400 g). The mean discordance rate of the infants was 11.8+/-9.7% (0.0-53.9%). Using operating points, the Decision Tree algorithm detected ROP prediction with 71% sensitivity and 80% specificity in CV, while the Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm detected 70% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the X-Tree and Random Forest algorithms detected ROP prediction with 84% and 80% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support that BW discordance may be effective in the development of ROP in preterm twins and that artificial intelligence models can predict the development of ROP in accordance with clinical findings.

Title: Modeling the influence of attitudes, trust, and beliefs on endoscopists' acceptance of artificial intelligence applications in medical practice.
Author: ['Schulz PJ', 'Lwin MO', 'Kee KM', 'Goh WWB', 'Lam TYT', 'Sung JJY']
Journal Title: Frontiers in public health
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The potential for deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in various fields of medicine is vast, yet acceptance of AI amongst clinicians has been patchy. This research therefore examines the role of antecedents, namely trust, attitude, and beliefs in driving AI acceptance in clinical practice. METHODS: We utilized online surveys to gather data from clinicians in the field of gastroenterology. RESULTS: A total of 164 participants responded to the survey. Participants had a mean age of 44.49 (SD = 9.65). Most participants were male (n = 116, 70.30%) and specialized in gastroenterology (n = 153, 92.73%). Based on the results collected, we proposed and tested a model of AI acceptance in medical practice. Our findings showed that while the proposed drivers had a positive impact on AI tools' acceptance, not all effects were direct. Trust and belief were found to fully mediate the effects of attitude on AI acceptance by clinicians. DISCUSSION: The role of trust and beliefs as primary mediators of the acceptance of AI in medical practice suggest that these should be areas of focus in AI education, engagement and training. This has implications for how AI systems can gain greater clinician acceptance to engender greater trust and adoption amongst public health systems and professional networks which in turn would impact how populations interface with AI. Implications for policy and practice, as well as future research in this nascent field, are discussed.

Author: ['Huang L', 'Lin Y', 'Cao P', 'Zou X', 'Qin Q', 'Lin Z', 'Liang F', 'Li Z']
Journal Title: Journal of applied clinical medical physics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ultrasonic for detecting and evaluating pleural effusion is an essential part of the Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (E-FAST) in emergencies. Our study aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostic model that automatically identifies and segments pleural effusion areas on ultrasonography. METHODS: An Attention U-net and a U-net model were used to detect and segment pleural effusion on ultrasound images of 848 subjects through fully supervised learning. Sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1 score, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying the data. The dice coefficient was used to evaluate the segmentation performance of the model. RESULTS: In 10 random tests, the Attention U-net and U-net 's average sensitivity of 97% demonstrated that the pleural effusion was well detectable. The Attention U-net performed better at identifying negative images than the U-net, which had an average specificity of 91% compared to 86% for the U-net. Additionally, the Attention U-net was more accurate in predicting the pleural effusion region because its average dice coefficient was 0.86 as opposed to the U-net's average dice coefficient of 0.82. CONCLUSIONS: The Attention U-net showed excellent performance in detecting and segmenting pleural effusion on ultrasonic images, which is expected to enhance the operation and application of E-FAST in clinical work.

Title: Modifying Kohlrausch's Law to Describe Nonaqueous Electrolytes for Lithium-Ion Batteries.
Author: ['Srinivasa MK', 'Lee J', 'Hyun K', 'Yoo HD']
Journal Title: ACS applied materials & interfaces
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: To develop next-generation lithium-ion batteries with enhanced stability and safety, it is crucial to understand the physicochemical principles of nonaqueous electrolytes. Kohlrausch's law describes a linear decrease in the molar conductivity (Lambda) with respect to the square root of the molarity of strong electrolytes at lower concentrations. This empirical law explains the impeded ionic mobility at higher concentrations due to ionic interactions, i.e., relaxation and asymmetric effects. However, this law does not hold at higher concentrations due to the ionic association that alleviates the ionic interactions and retards the decrease in the Lambda. Especially, the anomalously stagnant decrease in the Lambda near the solubility limit has not been clearly explained, calling for the consideration of other concentration-dependent factors such as the mean activity coefficient (gamma(+/-)), viscosity (eta), and dielectric constant (epsilon). Herein, we develop a systematic method to modify Kohlrausch's law. First, we install the ionic association constant, and the theoretical estimation is compared with the experimental results to induce the correction function that is related with the previously neglected concentration-dependent factors. Thus, the induced correction function was close to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, which has been widely used in the field of artificial intelligence. The modified Kohlrausch's law with the ReLU-type correction function provides a highly precise and reliable data fitting, and the fitted parameters showed clear concentration dependency and straightforward interpretability. As a result, this method effectively generalized Kohlrausch's law for nonaqueous electrolytes at higher concentrations up to the solubility limit of 3.0-3.5 M. Moreover, the modified Kohlrausch's law inspired us to discover the physical origins of the anomalously stagnant Lambda profiles near the solubility limit; and the most relevant physical origin of the anomaly was the concentration dependency of the gamma(+/-) and eta, which grow exponentially above a critical concentration.

Journal Title: Expert review of medical devices
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The steadily growing and aging world population, in conjunction with continuously increasing prevalences of vision-threatening retinal diseases, is placing an increasing burden on the global healthcare system. The main challenges within retinology involve identifying the comparatively few patients requiring therapy within the large mass, the assurance of comprehensive screening for retinal disease and individualized therapy planning. In order to sustain high-quality ophthalmic care in the future, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into our clinical practice represents a potential solution. AREAS COVERED: This review sheds light onto already realized and promising future applications of AI techniques in retinal imaging. The main attention is directed at the application in diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. The principles of use in disease screening, grading, therapeutic planning and prediction of future developments are explained based on the currently available literature. EXPERT OPINION: The recent accomplishments of AI in retinal imaging indicate that its implementation into our daily practice is likely to fundamentally change the ophthalmic healthcare system and bring us one step closer to the goal of individualized treatment. However, it must be emphasized that the aim is to optimally support clinicians by gradually incorporating AI approaches, rather than replacing ophthalmologists.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Analyzing the lower limb coronal morphological parameters in populations without knee osteoarthritis (KOA) holds significant value in predicting, diagnosing, and formulating surgical strategies for KOA. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the variability in these parameters among Chinese non-KOA populations, employing a substantial sample size. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was performed on the Chinese non-KOA populations (n = 407; 49.9% females). The study employed an in-house developed artificial intelligence software to meticulously assess the coronal morphological parameters of all 814 lower limbs. The parameters evaluated included the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAA), weight-bearing line ratio (WBLR), joint line convergence angle (JLCA), mechanical lateral-proximal-femoral angle (mLPFA), mechanical lateral-distal-femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial-proximal-tibial angle (mMPTA), and mechanical lateral-distal-tibial angle (mLDTA). Differences in these parameters were compared between left and right limbs, different genders, and different age groups (with 50 years as the cut-off point). RESULTS: HKAA and JLCA exhibited left-right differences (left vs. right: 178.2 degrees  +/- 3.0 degrees  vs. 178.6 degrees  +/- 2.9 degrees  for HKAA, p = 0.001; and 1.8 degrees  +/- 1.5 degrees  vs. 1.4 degrees  +/- 1.6 degrees  for JLCA, p < 0.001); except for the mLPFA, all other parameters show gender-related differences (male vs. female: 177.9 degrees  +/- 2.8 degrees  vs. 179.0 degrees  +/- 3.0 degrees  for HKAA, p < 0.001; 1.5 degrees  +/- 1.5 degrees  vs. 1.8 degrees  +/- 1.7 degrees  for JLCA, p = 0.003; 87.1 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees vs. 88.1 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees  for mMPTA, p < 0.001; 90.2 degrees  +/- 4.0 degrees  vs. 91.1 degrees  +/- 3.2 degrees  for mLDTA, p < 0.001; 38.7% +/- 12.9% vs. 43.6% +/- 14.1% for WBLR, p < 0.001; and 87.7 degrees  +/- 2.3 degrees vs. 87.4 degrees  +/- 2.7 degrees  for mLDTA, p = 0.045); mLPFA increase with age (younger vs. older: 90.1 degrees  +/- 7.2 degrees  vs. 93.4 degrees  +/- 4.9 degrees  for mLPFA, p < 0.001), while no statistical difference exists for other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: There were differences in lower limb coronal morphological parameters among Chinese non-KOA populations between left and right sides, different genders, and age.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory processes, demyelination, neurodegeneration, and axonal damage within the central nervous system (CNS). Retinal imaging, particularly Optical coherence tomography (OCT), has emerged as a crucial tool for investigating MS-related retinal injury. The integration of artificial intelligence(AI) has shown promise in enhancing OCT analysis for MS. Researchers are actively utilizing AI algorithms to accurately detect and classify MS-related abnormalities, leading to improved efficiency in diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized treatment planning. The prognostic value of AI in predicting MS disease progression has garnered substantial attention. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms can analyze longitudinal OCT data to forecast the course of the disease, providing critical information for personalized treatment planning and improved patient outcomes. Early detection of high-risk patients allows for targeted interventions to mitigate disability progression effectively. As such, AI-driven approaches yielded remarkable abilities in classifying distinct MS subtypes based on retinal features, aiding in disease characterization and guiding tailored therapeutic strategies. Additionally, these algorithms have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of OCT image segmentation, streamlined diagnostic processes, and reduced human error. This study reviews the current research studies on the integration of AI,including ML and DL algorithms, with OCT in the context of MS. It examines the advancements, challenges, potential prospects, and ethical concerns of AI-powered techniques in enhancing MS diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, revolutionizing patient care, the development of patient screening tools, and supported clinical decision-making based on OCT images.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Accuracy and validity of voice AI algorithms rely on substantial quality voice data. Although commensurable amounts of voice data are captured daily in voice centers across North America, there is no standardized protocol for acoustic data management, which limits the usability of these datasets for voice artificial intelligence (AI) research. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to capture current practices of voice data collection, storage, analysis, and perceived limitations to collaborative voice research. METHODS: A 30-question online survey was developed with expert guidance from the voicecollab.ai members, an international collaborative of voice AI researchers. The survey was disseminated via REDCap to an estimated 200 practitioners at North American voice centers. Survey questions assessed respondents' current practices in terms of acoustic data collection, storage, and retrieval as well as limitations to collaborative voice research. RESULTS: Seventy-two respondents completed the survey of which 81.7% were laryngologists and 18.3% were speech language pathologists (SLPs). Eighteen percent of respondents reported seeing 40%-60% and 55% reported seeing >60 patients with voice disorders weekly (conservative estimate of over 4000 patients/week). Only 28% of respondents reported utilizing standardized protocols for collection and storage of acoustic data. Although, 87% of respondents conduct voice research, only 38% of respondents report doing so on a multi-institutional level. Perceived limitations to conducting collaborative voice research include lack of standardized methodology for collection (30%) and lack of human resources to prepare and label voice data adequately (55%). CONCLUSION: To conduct large-scale multi-institutional voice research with AI, there is a pertinent need for standardization of acoustic data management, as well as an infrastructure for secure and efficient data sharing.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Maternal anxiety, depression, and stress during and after pregnancy are negatively associated with child cognitive development. However, the contribution of positive maternal experiences, such as social support, to child cognitive development has received less attention. Furthermore, how maternal experience of social support during specific developmental periods impacts child cognitive development is largely unknown. METHODS: Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 5784) and the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction study (PREDO; n = 420), we investigated the associations between maternal perceived social support during and after pregnancy and child's general cognitive ability at 8 years of age, assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Bayesian relevant life course modeling was used to investigate timing effects of maternal social support on child cognitive ability. RESULTS: In both cohorts, higher maternal perceived social support during pregnancy was associated with higher performance on the WISC, independent of sociodemographic factors and concurrent maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. In ALSPAC, pregnancy emerged as a sensitive period for the effects of perceived social support on child cognitive ability, with a stronger effect of social support during pregnancy than after pregnancy on child cognitive ability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, supported from two prospective longitudinal cohorts, suggest a distinct role of maternal perceived social support during pregnancy for cognitive development in children. Our study suggests that interventions aimed at increasing maternal social support during pregnancy may be an important strategy for promoting maternal and child well-being.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly applied to breast ultrasonography. They are expected to decrease the workload of radiologists and to improve diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of an AI system for the BI-RADS category assessment in breast masses detected on breast ultrasound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 715 masses detected in 530 patients were analyzed. Three breast imaging centers of the same institution and nine breast radiologists participated in this study. Ultrasound was performed by one radiologist who obtained two orthogonal views of each detected lesion. These images were retrospectively reviewed by a second radiologist blinded to the patient's clinical data. A commercial AI system evaluated images. The level of agreement between the AI system and the two radiologists and their diagnostic performance were calculated according to dichotomic BI-RADS category assessment. RESULTS: This study included 715 breast masses. Of these, 134 (18.75%) were malignant, and 581 (81.25%) were benign. In discriminating benign and probably benign from suspicious lesions, the agreement between AI and the first and second radiologists was moderate statistically. The sensitivity and specificity of radiologist 1, radiologist 2, and AI were calculated as 98.51% and 80.72%, 97.76% and 75.56%, and 98.51% and 65.40%, respectively. For radiologist 1, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 54.10%, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.58%, and the accuracy was 84.06%. Radiologist 2 achieved a PPV of 47.99%, NPV of 99.32%, and accuracy of 79.72%. The AI system exhibited a PPV of 39.64%, NPV of 99.48%, and accuracy of 71.61%. Notably, none of the lesions categorized as BI-RADS 2 by AI were malignant, while 2 of the lesions classified as BI-RADS 3 by AI were subsequently confirmed as malignant. By considering AI-assigned BI-RADS 2 as safe, we could potentially avoid 11% (18 out of 163) of benign lesion biopsies and 46.2% (110 out of 238) of follow-ups. CONCLUSION: AI proves effective in predicting malignancy. Integrating it into the clinical workflow has the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies and short-term follow-ups, which, in turn, can contribute to sustainability in healthcare practices.

Title: Wavefront reconstruction of a non-diffracting structured laser beam.
Author: ['Dusek M', 'Gayde JC', 'Sulc M']
Journal Title: Optics express
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: The Structured Laser Beam (SLB) is a pseudo-non-diffracting laser beam that shares many characteristics with a Bessel beam. However, it can theoretically propagate over an unlimited distance while maintaining an extremely low inner core divergence of only 0.01 mrad. This makes it a promising candidate for precise long-distance alignment applications such as the alignment of particle accelerator components at CERN. In this work, a novel method to assess the symmetrical wavefront aberrations induced by an SLB generator is presented. Our approach is based on the analysis of a single-intensity distribution of an SLB. The coefficients of the Zernike polynomials are estimated using artificial intelligence before least-squares fitting is used to refine the result. This approach ensures that the fitting avoids local minima. This method provides a novel way to analyze the optical aberrations induced by the SLB generator.

Author: ['Li Z', 'Zhao W', 'Lin X', 'Li F']
Journal Title: Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: Osteoporotic fractures impose a substantial burden on patients with diabetes due to their unique characteristics in bone metabolism, limiting the efficacy of conventional fracture prediction tools. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown great promise in predicting osteoporotic fractures. This review aims to evaluate the application of traditional fracture prediction tools (FRAX, QFracture, and Garvan FRC) in patients with diabetes and osteoporosis, review AI-based fracture prediction achievements, and assess the potential efficiency of AI algorithms in this population. This comprehensive literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Web of Science. We found that conventional prediction tools exhibit limited accuracy in predicting fractures in patients with diabetes and osteoporosis due to their distinct bone metabolism characteristics. Conversely, AI algorithms show remarkable potential in enhancing predictive precision and improving patient outcomes. However, the utilization of AI algorithms for predicting osteoporotic fractures in diabetic patients is still in its nascent phase, further research is required to validate their efficacy and assess the potential advantages of their application in clinical practice.

Author: ['Tran NL', 'Kim H', 'Shin CH', 'Ko E', 'Oh SJ']
Journal Title: Cancer cell international
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of integrating a large amount of related information to predict therapeutic relationships such as disease treatment with known drugs, gene expression, and drug-target binding. AI has gained increasing attention as a promising tool for next-generation drug development. METHODS: An AI method was used for drug repurposing and target identification for cancer. Among 8 survived candidates after background checking, N-(1-propyl-1H-1,3-benzodiazol-2-yl)-3-(pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) benzamide (Z29077885) was newly selected as an new anti-cancer drug, and the anti-cancer efficacy of Z29077885 was confirmed using cell viability, western blot, cell cycle, apoptosis assay in MDA-MB 231 and A549 in vitro. Then, anti-tumor efficacy of Z29077885 was validated in an in vivo A549 xenograft in BALB/c nude mice. RESULTS: First, we discovered an antiviral agent, Z29077885, as a new anticancer drug candidate using the AI deep learning method. Next, we demonstrated that Z29077885 inhibits Serine/threonine kinase 33 (STK33) enzymatic function in vitro and showed the anticancer efficacy in various cancer cells. Then, we found enhanced apoptosis via S-phase cell cycle arrest as the mechanism underlying the anticancer efficacy of Z29077885 in both lung and breast cancer cells. Finally, we confirmed the anti-tumor efficacy of Z29077885 in an in vivo A549 xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used an AI-driven screening strategy to find a novel anticancer medication targeting STK33 that triggers cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the s phase. It will pave a way to efficiently discover new anticancer drugs.

Journal Title: International journal of legal medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: Forensic medicine is a thriving application field for artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, AI applications intended to forensic pathologists or forensic physicians have emerged since the last decade. For example, AI models were developed to help estimate the biological age of migrants or human remains. However, the uses of AI applications by forensic pathologists or physicians and their levels of integration in medicolegal practices are not well described yet. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases. This review included articles that mention any AI application used by forensic pathologists or physicians in practice or any AI model applied in one expertise field of the forensic pathologist or physician. Articles in other languages than English or French or dealing mainly with complementary analyses handled by experts who are not forensic pathologists or physicians or with AI to analyze data for research purposes in forensic medicine were excluded from this review. All the relevant information was retrieved in each article from a grid analysis derived and adapted from the TRIPOD checklist. This review included 35 articles and revealed that AI applications are developed in thanatology and in clinical forensic medicine. However, those applications seem to mainly remain in research and development stages. Indeed, the use of AI applications by forensic pathologists or physicians is not actual due to issues discussed in this article. Finally, the integration of AI in daily medicolegal practice involves not only forensic pathologists or physicians but also legal professionals.

Abstract: An in situ microscope based on pulsed transmitted light illumination via optical fiber was combined to artificial-intelligence to enable for the first time an online cell classification according to well-known cellular morphological features. A 848 192-image database generated during a lab-scale production process of antibodies was processed using a convolutional neural network approach chosen for its accurate real-time object detection capabilities. In order to induce different cell death routes, hybridomas were grown in normal or suboptimal conditions in a stirred tank reactor, in the presence of substrate limitation, medium addition, pH regulation problem or oxygen depletion. Using such an optical system made it possible to monitor real-time the evolution of different classes of animal cells, among which viable, necrotic and apoptotic cells. A class of viable cells displaying bulges in feast or famine conditions was also revealed. Considered as a breakthrough in the catalogue of process analytical tools, in situ microscopy powered by artificial-intelligence is also of great interest for research.
