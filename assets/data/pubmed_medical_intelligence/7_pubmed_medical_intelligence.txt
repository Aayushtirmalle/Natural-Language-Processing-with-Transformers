Abstract: Background This study aims to explore the factors associated with artificial intelligence (AI) and patient autonomy in obesity treatment decision-making. Methodology A cross-sectional, online, descriptive survey design was adopted in this study. The survey instrument incorporated the Ideal Patient Autonomy Scale (IPAS) and other factors affecting patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship. The study participants included 74 physicians, 55 dieticians, and 273 obese patients. Results Different views were expressed in the scales AI knows the best (mu = 2.95-3.15) and the patient should decide (mu = 2.95-3.16). Ethical concerns (mu = 3.24) and perceived privacy risks (mu = 3.58) were identified as having a more negative influence on patient autonomy compared to personal innovativeness (mu = 2.41) and trust (mu = 2.85). Physicians and dieticians expressed significantly higher trust in AI compared to patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions Patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship is significantly affected by privacy, trust, and ethical issues. As trust is a multifaceted factor and AI is a novel technology in healthcare, it is essential to fully explore the various factors influencing trust and patient autonomy.

Title: Liability for harm caused by AI in healthcare: an overview of the core legal concepts.
Author: ['Bottomley D', 'Thaldar D']
Journal Title: Frontiers in pharmacology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare in Africa presents transformative opportunities but also raises profound legal challenges, especially concerning liability. As AI becomes more autonomous, determining who or what is responsible when things go wrong becomes ambiguous. This article aims to review the legal concepts relevant to the issue of liability for harm caused by AI in healthcare. While some suggest attributing legal personhood to AI as a potential solution, the feasibility of this remains controversial. The principal-agent relationship, where the physician is held responsible for AI decisions, risks reducing the adoption of AI tools due to potential liabilities. Similarly, using product law to establish liability is problematic because of the dynamic learning nature of AI, which deviates from static products. This fluidity complicates traditional definitions of product defects and, by extension, where responsibility lies. Exploring alternatives, risk-based determinations of liability, which focus on potential hazards rather than on specific fault assignments, emerges as a potential pathway. However, these, too, present challenges in assigning accountability. Strict liability has been proposed as another avenue. It can simplify the compensation process for victims by focusing on the harm rather than on the fault. Yet, concerns arise over the economic impact on stakeholders, the potential for unjust reputational damage, and the feasibility of a global application. Instead of approaches based on liability, reconciliation holds much promise to facilitate regulatory sandboxes. In conclusion, while the integration of AI systems into healthcare holds vast potential, it necessitates a re-evaluation of our legal frameworks. The central challenge is how to adapt traditional concepts of liability to the novel and unpredictable nature of AI-or to move away from liability towards reconciliation. Future discussions and research must navigate these complex waters and seek solutions that ensure both progress and protection.

Author: ['Jacquemyn X', 'Kutty S', 'Manlhiot C']
Journal Title: CJC pediatric and congenital heart disease
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Medical advancements in the diagnosis, surgical techniques, perioperative care, and continued care throughout childhood have transformed the outlook for individuals with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), improving survival and shifting the perspective towards lifelong care. However, with a growing population of survivors, longstanding challenges have been accentuated, and new challenges have surfaced, necessitating a re-evaluation of TOF care. Availability of prenatal diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging techniques, previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding optimal timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. To address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize patient management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with TOF. Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and diagnosis, automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk stratification, and planning and performing cardiac interventions. By embracing these advancements and incorporating them into routine clinical practice, personalized medicine could be delivered, leading to the best possible outcomes for patients. In this review, we provide an overview of these evolving applications and emphasize the challenges, limitations, and future potential for integrating them into clinical care.

Title: Human-Machine Collaboration for Accelerated Discovery of Promising Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts with On-Demand Elements.
Author: ['Sakaushi K', 'Hoisang W', 'Tamura R']
Journal Title: ACS central science
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: A drastically efficient method for identifying electrocatalysts with desirable functionality is a pressing necessity for making a breakthrough in advanced water-electrolyzers toward large-scale green hydrogen production and addressing the significant challenge of carbon neutrality. Despite extensive investigations over the last several centuries, it remains a time-consuming task to identify even one promising affordable electrocatalyst without platinum-group-metal (PGM) for one electrochemical reaction due to its great complexities, particularly for the key anode reaction in the water-electrolyzer of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we demonstrate that a human-machine collaboration based on stepwise-evolving artificial intelligence (se-AI) can significantly shorten the development period of PGM-free multimetal OER electrocatalysts with performance beyond a PGM of RuO(2). We were able to reach optimized materials only after 2% experimental trials of the entire candidate pool. The best PGM-free electrocatalyst discovered exhibited excellent activity comparable to RuO(2) and, surprisingly, also demonstrated superior stability with a high current density of up to 1000 mA/cm(2) at even pH 9.2, which condition is a thermodynamically challenging for typical PGM-free materials. This work illustrates that human's material discovery can be significantly accelerated through collaboration with AI.

Title: The Management of Diabetes with Hyperuricemia: Can We Hit Two Birds with One Stone?
Author: ['Wang Y', 'Lu J']
Journal Title: Journal of inflammation research
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Serum urate (SU) is an independent predictor for the incidence of diabetes. In current diabetes treatment regimens, there is insufficient appreciation of the importance of hyperuricemia (HU) in disease control and prevention. To summarize the updated knowledge on the effects of SU on beta-cell function, insulin resistance and chronic diabetic complications, as well as to evaluate the management of patients with both HU and diabetes, we searched the MEDLINE PubMed database, and included 285 journal articles. An inverted U-shaped relationship between fasting plasma glucose and SU levels was established in this review. Elevated SU levels may enhance the development of chronic diabetic complications, including macrovascular and microvascular dysfunction. Diet and exercise are essential parts of the lifestyle changes necessary for HU and diabetes management. Glucose- and urate-lowering drug selection and combination should be made with the principle of ameliorating, and at least not deteriorating, diabetes and HU. Medical artificial intelligence technology and monitoring systems can help to improve the effectiveness of long-term management of HU and diabetes through digital healthcare. This study comprehensively reviews and provides a scientific and reliable basis for and viewpoints on the clinical management of diabetes and HU.

Journal Title: Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 31
Abstract: Soft metamaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their remarkable properties. These materials hold the potential to program and control the morphing behavior of soft machines, however, their combination is limited by the poor reprogrammability of metamaterials and incompatible communication between them. Here, printable and recyclable soft metamaterials possessing reprogrammable embedded intelligence to regulate the morphing of soft machines are introduced. These metamaterials are constructed from interconnected and periodically arranged logic unit cells that are able to perform compound logic operations coupling multiplication and negation. The scalable computation capacity of the unit cell empowers it to simultaneously process multiple fluidic signals with different types and magnitudes, thereby allowing the execution of sophisticated and high-level control operations. By establishing the laws of physical Boolean algebra and formulating a universal design route, soft metamaterials capable of diverse logic operations can be readily created and reprogrammed. Besides, the metamaterials' potential of directly serving as fluidic processors for soft machines is validated by constructing a soft latched demultiplexer, soft controllers capable of universal and customizable morphing programming, and a reprogrammable processor without reconnection. This work provides a facile way to create reprogrammable soft fluidic control systems to meet on-demand requirements in dynamic situations.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 31
Abstract: Personalized healthcare management is an emerging field that requires the development of environment-friendly, integrated, and electrochemical multimodal devices. In this study, the concept of integrated paper-based biosensors (IFP(-Multi) ) for personalized healthcare management is introduced. By leveraging ink printing technology and a ChatGPT-bioelectronic interface, these biosensors offer ultrahigh areal-specific capacitance (74633 mF cm(-2) ), excellent mechanical properties, and multifunctional sensing and humidity power generation capabilities. More importantly, the IFP(-Multi) devices have the potential to simulate deaf-mute vocalization and can be integrated into wearable sensors to detect muscle contractions and bending motions. Moreover, they also enable monitoring of physiological signals from various body parts, such as the throat, nape, elbow, wrist, and knee, and successfully record sharp and repeatable signals generated by muscle contractions. In addition, the IFP(-Multi) devices demonstrate self-powered handwriting sensing and moisture power generation for sweat-sensing applications. As a proof-of-concept, a GPT 3.5 model-based fine-tuning and prediction pipeline that utilizes recorded physiological signals through IFP(-Multi) is showcased, enabling artificial intelligence with multimodal sensing capabilities for personalized healthcare management. This work presents a promising and ecofriendly approach to developing paper-based electrochemical multimodal devices, paving the way for a new era of healthcare advancements.

Journal Title: Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate macula structure thickness and volume changes in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) -assisted optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the thickness and volume of macula in Moyamoya patients. ETDRS zoning divides the macula into nine different regions. In 15 patients with radial scanning OCT, the average thickness and volume of retina, RNFL, GCL, and choroid in these regions were measured. In 30 patients with radial or horizontal scanning OCT, based on the anatomical structure, the macula is divided into seven segments. Mean Sattler layer-choriocapillaris complex thickness (SLCCT), Haller layer thickness, and total choroidal thickness were measured for each segment using AI-assisted OCT. RESULTS: We recruited 30 patients (59 eyes) with MMD. In the 15 patients (29 eyes) who underwent radial scanning OCT, no significant change in retina, RNFL, GCL, and choroidal thickness was identified between the two groups (p>0.05). There was no significant change in retina, RNFL, or choroidal volume between the two groups in different ETDRS macula regions (p>0.05). The GCL volume in the macula's inner ring nasal portion (IN) was significantly lower. SLCCTs were considerably reduced in six macula regions in moyamoya groups (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant change in Haller layer thickness. Only the nasal perifovea (PE_N) exhibited a significant variation in choroidal thickness. The Moyamoya group showed reduced choroidal thickness in PE_N segment. CONCLUSION: In patients with MMD, there is thinning of the Sattler layer-choriocapillaris complex in the choroid.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To explore the possibility of automatic diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with CHD (PAH-CHD) from chest radiographs using artificial intelligence (AI) technology and to evaluate whether AI assistance could improve clinical diagnostic accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 3255 frontal preoperative chest radiographs (1174 CHD of any type and 2081 non-CHD) were retrospectively obtained. In this study, we adopted ResNet18 pretrained with the ImageNet database to establish diagnostic models. Radiologists diagnosed CHD/PAH-CHD from 330/165 chest radiographs twice: the first time, 50% of the images were accompanied by AI-based classification; after a month, the remaining 50% were accompanied by AI-based classification. Diagnostic results were compared between the radiologists and AI models, and between radiologists with and without AI assistance. RESULTS: The AI model achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.948 (sensitivity: 0.970, specificity: 0.982) for CHD diagnoses and an AUC of 0.778 (sensitivity: 0.632, specificity: 0.925) for identifying PAH-CHD. In the 330 balanced (165 CHD and 165 non-CHD) testing set, AI achieved higher AUCs than all 5 radiologists in the identification of CHD (0.670-0.858) and PAH-CHD (0.610-0.688). With AI assistance, the mean +/- standard error AUC of radiologists was significantly improved for CHD (DeltaAUC + 0.096, 95 % CI: 0.001-0.190; P = 0.048) and PAH-CHD (DeltaAUC + 0.066, 95 % CI: 0.010-0.122; P = 0.031) diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Chest radiograph-based AI models can detect CHD and PAH-CHD automatically. AI assistance improved radiologists' diagnostic accuracy, which may facilitate a timely initial diagnosis of CHD and PAH-CHD.

Title: Quo Vadis Hyperpolarized (13)C MRI?
Author: ['Wodtke P', 'Grashei M', 'Schilling F']
Journal Title: Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: Over the last two decades, hyperpolarized (13)C MRI has gained significance in both preclinical and clinical studies, hereby relying on technologies like PHIP-SAH (ParaHydrogen-Induced Polarization-Side Arm Hydrogenation), SABRE (Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange), and dDNP (dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization), with dDNP being applied in humans. A clinical dDNP polarizer has enabled studies across 24 sites, despite challenges like high cost and slow polarization. Parahydrogen-based techniques like SABRE and PHIP offer faster, more cost-efficient alternatives but require molecule-specific optimization. The focus has been on imaging metabolism of hyperpolarized probes, which requires long T(1), high polarization and rapid contrast generation. Efforts to establish novel probes, improve acquisition techniques and enhance data analysis methods including artificial intelligence are ongoing. Potential clinical value of hyperpolarized (13)C MRI was demonstrated primarily for treatment response assessment in oncology, but also in cardiology, nephrology, hepatology and CNS characterization. In this review on biomedical hyperpolarized (13)C MRI, we summarize important and recent advances in polarization techniques, probe development, acquisition and analysis methods as well as clinical trials. Starting from those we try to sketch a trajectory where the field of biomedical hyperpolarized (13)C MRI might go.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic surgical skill assessment and machine learning are often inaccessible to low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). Our team developed a low-cost laparoscopic training system to teach and assess psychomotor skills required in laparoscopic salpingostomy in LMICs. We performed video review using AI to assess global surgical techniques. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of artificial intelligence (AI) generated scoring measures of laparoscopic simulation videos by comparing the accuracy of AI results to human-generated scores. DESIGN: Seventy-four surgical simulation videos were collected and graded by human participants using a modified OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills). The videos were then analyzed via AI using 3 different time and distance-based calculations of the laparoscopic instruments including path length, dimensionless jerk, and standard deviation of tool position. Predicted scores were generated using 5-fold cross validation and K-Nearest-Neighbors to train classifiers. SETTING: Surgical novices and experts from a variety of hospitals in Ethiopia, Cameroon, Kenya, and the United States contributed 74 laparoscopic salpingostomy simulation videos. RESULTS: Complete accuracy of AI compared to human assessment ranged from 65-77%. There were no statistical differences in rank mean scores for 3 domains, Flow of Operation, Respect for Tissue, and Economy of Motion, while there were significant differences in ratings for Instrument Handling, Overall Performance, and the total summed score of all 5 domains (Summed). Estimated effect sizes were all less than 0.11, indicating very small practical effect. Estimated intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of Summed was 0.72 indicating moderate correlation between AI and Human scores. CONCLUSIONS: Video review using AI technology of global characteristics was similar to that of human review in our laparoscopic training system. Machine learning may help fill an educational gap in LMICs where direct apprenticeship may not be feasible.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore optimal feedback methodologies to enhance trainee skill acquisition in simulated surgical bimanual skills learning during brain tumor resections. HYPOTHESES: (1) Providing feedback results in better learning outcomes in teaching surgical technical skill when compared to practice alone with no tailored performance feedback. (2) Providing more visual and visuospatial feedback results in better learning outcomes when compared to providing numerical feedback. DESIGN: A prospective 4-parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre, McGill University, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students (n = 120) from 4 Quebec medical schools. RESULTS: Participants completed a virtually simulated tumor resection task 5 times while receiving 1 of 4 feedback based on their group allocation: (1) practice-alone without feedback, (2) numerical feedback, (3) visual feedback, and (4) visuospatial feedback. Outcome measures were participants' scores on 14-performance metrics and the number of expert benchmarks achieved during each task. There were no significant differences in the first task which determined baseline performance. A statistically significant interaction between feedback allocation and task repetition was found on the number of benchmarks achieved, F (10.558, 408.257)=3.220, p < 0.001. Participants in all feedback groups significantly improved their performance compared to baseline. The visual feedback group achieved significantly higher number of benchmarks than the practice-alone group by the third repetition of the task, p = 0.005, 95%CI [0.42 3.25]. Visual feedback and visuospatial feedback improved performance significantly by the second repetition of the task, p = 0.016, 95%CI [0.19 2.71] and p = 0.003, 95%CI [0.4 2.57], respectively. CONCLUSION: Simulations with autonomous visual computer assistance may be effective pedagogical tools in teaching bimanual operative skills via visual and visuospatial feedback information delivery.

Title: Emotional intelligence of radiography students in a low resource setting: A cross-sectional survey.
Author: ['Chinene B', 'Mudadi LS']
Journal Title: Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Understanding noncognitive traits like emotional intelligence (EI) is valuable for radiography students, academics, practitioners, and educators. It helps them become aware of how these traits can impact their training, placements, and careers. This study aimed to evaluate the EI of radiography students at a tertiary institute in Harare, Zimbabwe. METHODS: A quantitative cross-sectional study using a validated Trait EI questionnaire was conducted on students at a tertiary institute in Harare, Zimbabwe. Student t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Spearman's rho were employed for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 84 radiography students were enrolled in this study. The students had relatively lower EI scores (4.31 +/-0.49) as compared to most of their global counterparts. A significant positive monotonic relationship was identified between age and self-control factor (Spearman's rho = 0.22, p = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in mean scores for the global and the four EI factors when stratified by gender, even though males had slightly higher scores than females in all but the emotionality factor. There were no significant differences in the mean scores of the global as well as the four factors by year of study. CONCLUSION: Deliberate, time-intensive curriculum interventions are needed to improve the EI of radiography students in Zimbabwe and this trend is potentially similar to other resource-limited settings. However, more context-specific evidence is needed to formulate the best techniques for EI interventions.

Title: Could ChatGPT Pass the UK Radiology Fellowship Examinations?
Author: ['Ariyaratne S', 'Jenko N', 'Mark Davies A', 'Iyengar KP', 'Botchu R']
Journal Title: Academic radiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool which utilises machine learning to generate original text resembling human language. AI models have recently demonstrated remarkable ability at analysing and solving problems, including passing professional examinations. We investigate the performance of ChatGPT on some of the UK radiology fellowship equivalent examination questions. METHODS: ChatGPT was asked to answer questions from question banks resembling the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) examination. The entire physics part 1 question bank (203 5-part true/false questions) was answered by the GPT-4 model and answers recorded. 240 single best answer questions (SBAs) (representing the true length of the FRCR 2A examination) were answered by both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. RESULTS: ChatGPT 4 answered 74.8% of part 1 true/false statements correctly. The spring 2023 passing mark of the part 1 examination was 75.5% and ChatGPT thus narrowly failed. In the 2A examination, ChatGPT 3.5 answered 50.8% SBAs correctly, while GPT-4 answered 74.2% correctly. The winter 2022 2A pass mark was 63.3% and thus GPT-4 clearly passed. CONCLUSION: AI models such as ChatGPT are able to answer the majority of questions in an FRCR style examination. It is reasonable to assume that further developments in AI will be more likely to succeed in comprehending and solving questions related to medicine, specifically clinical radiology. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our findings outline the unprecedented capabilities of AI, adding to the current relatively small body of literature on the subject, which in turn can play a role medical training, evaluation and practice. This can undoubtedly have implications for radiology.

Journal Title: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: PURPOSE: Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies allows for the accurate prediction of radiotherapy dose distributions, enhancing treatment planning efficiency. However, esophageal cancers present unique challenges due to tumor complexity and diverse prescription types. Additionally, limited data availability hampers the effectiveness of existing AI models. This study developed a deep learning model, trained on a diverse dataset of esophageal cancer prescriptions, to improve dose prediction accuracy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively collected data from 530 esophageal cancer patients, including single-target and simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) prescriptions, for model building. The proposed Asymmetric ResNeSt (AS-NeSt) model features novel 3D ResNeSt blocks and an asymmetric architecture. We constructed a loss function targeting global and local doses and validated the model's performance against existing alternatives. Model assisted experiments were used to validate its clinical benefits. RESULTS: The AS-NeSt model maintained an absolute prediction error below 5% for each dosimetric metric. The average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for isodose volumes was 0.93. The model achieved an average relative prediction error of 2.02%, statistically lower than HD-Unet (4.17%), DoseNet (2.35%), and DCNN (3.65%). It also demonstrated significantly fewer parameters and shorter prediction times. Clinically, the AS-NeSt model raised physicians' ability to accurately pre-assess appropriate treatment methods before planning from 95.24% to 100%, reduced planning time by over 61% for junior dosimetrists and 52% for senior dosimetrists, and decreased both inter- and intra-dosimetrist discrepancies by more than 50%. CONCLUSION: The AS-NeSt model, developed with innovative 3D ResNeSt blocks and an asymmetric encoder-decoder structure, has been validated using clinical esophageal cancer patient data. It accurately predicts 3D dose distributions for various prescriptions, including SIB, showing potential to improve the management of esophageal cancer treatment in a clinical setting.
