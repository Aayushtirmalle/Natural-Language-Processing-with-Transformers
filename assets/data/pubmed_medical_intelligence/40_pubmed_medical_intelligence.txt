Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness in Saudi Arabia. With a prevalence of up to 40% of patients with diabetes, DR constitutes a significant public health burden on the country. Saudi Arabia has not yet established a national screening program for DR. Mounting evidence shows that Artificial intelligence (AI)-based DR screening programs are slowly becoming superior to traditional screening, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating research into this topic as well as changing the outlook of the public toward it. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the perception and acceptance of AI in DR screening among eye care professionals in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered online-based questionnaire was distributed by email through the registry of the Saudi Commission For Health Specialties (SCFHS). 309 ophthalmologists and physicians involved in diabetic eye care in Saudi Arabia participated in the study. Data analysis was done by SPSS, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant for statistical purposes. RESULTS: 54% of participants rated their level of AI knowledge as above average and 63% believed that AI and telemedicine are interchangeable. 66% believed that AI would decrease the workforce of physicians. 79% expected clinical efficiency to increase with AI. Around 50% of participants expected AI to be implemented in the next 5 years. DISCUSSION: Most participants reported good knowledge about AI. Physicians with more clinical experience and those who used e-health apps in clinical practice regarded their AI knowledge as higher than their peers. Perceived knowledge was strongly related to acceptance of the benefits of AI-based DR screening. In general, there was a positive attitude toward AI-based DR screening. However, concerns related to the labor market and data confidentiality were evident. There should be further education and awareness about the topic.

Title: Advances in melanoma: epidemiology, diagnosis, and prognosis.
Author: ['Waseh S', 'Lee JB']
Journal Title: Frontiers in medicine
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Unraveling the multidimensional complexities of melanoma has required concerted efforts by dedicated community of researchers and clinicians battling against this deadly form of skin cancer. Remarkable advances have been made in the realm of epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, and therapy of melanoma. The treatment of advanced melanomas has entered the golden era as targeted personalized therapies have emerged that have significantly altered the mortality rate. A paradigm shift in the approach to melanoma classification, diagnosis, prognosis, and staging is underway, fueled by discoveries of genetic alterations in melanocytic neoplasms. A morphologic clinicopathologic classification of melanoma is expected to be replaced by a more precise molecular based one. As validated, convenient, and cost-effective molecular-based tests emerge, molecular diagnostics will play a greater role in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of melanoma. Artificial intelligence augmented clinical and histologic diagnosis of melanoma is expected to make the process more streamlined and efficient. A more accurate model of prognosis and staging of melanoma is emerging based on molecular understanding melanoma. This contribution summarizes the recent advances in melanoma epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, and prognosis.

Abstract: Ultrasonography (US) has become a valuable imaging tool for the examination of the musculoskeletal system. It provides important diagnostic information and it can also be very useful in the assessment of disease activity and treatment response. US has gained widespread use in rheumatology practice because it provides real time and dynamic assessment, although it is dependent on the examiner's experience. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the process of image recognition and interpretation has the potential to overcome certain limitations related to physician-dependent assessment, such as the variability in image acquisition. Multiple studies in the field of AI have explored how integrated machine learning algorithms could automate specific tissue recognition, diagnosis of joint and muscle pathology, and even grading of synovitis which is essential for monitoring disease activity. AI-based techniques applied in musculoskeletal US imaging focus on automated segmentation, image enhancement, detection and classification. AI-based US imaging can thus improve accuracy, time efficiency and offer a framework for standardization between different examinations. This paper will offer an overview of current research in the field of AI-based ultrasonography of the musculoskeletal system with focus on the applications of machine learning techniques in the examination of joints, muscles and peripheral nerves, which could potentially improve the performance of everyday clinical practice.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Malaria is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, with 247 million cases reported worldwide in 2021 according to the World Health Organization. Optical microscopy remains the gold standard technique for malaria diagnosis, however, it requires expertise, is time-consuming and difficult to reproduce. Therefore, new diagnostic techniques based on digital image analysis using artificial intelligence tools can improve diagnosis and help automate it. METHODS: In this study, a dataset of 2571 labeled thick blood smear images were created. YOLOv5x, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet object detection neural networks were trained on the same dataset to evaluate their performance in Plasmodium parasite detection. Attention modules were applied and compared with YOLOv5x results. To automate the entire diagnostic process, a prototype of 3D-printed pieces was designed for the robotization of conventional optical microscopy, capable of auto-focusing the sample and tracking the entire slide. RESULTS: Comparative analysis yielded a performance for YOLOv5x on a test set of 92.10% precision, 93.50% recall, 92.79% F-score, and 94.40% mAP0.5 for leukocyte, early and mature Plasmodium trophozoites overall detection. F-score values of each category were 99.0% for leukocytes, 88.6% for early trophozoites and 87.3% for mature trophozoites detection. Attention modules performance show non-significant statistical differences when compared to YOLOv5x original trained model. The predictive models were integrated into a smartphone-computer application for the purpose of image-based diagnostics in the laboratory. The system can perform a fully automated diagnosis by the auto-focus and X-Y movements of the robotized microscope, the CNN models trained for digital image analysis, and the smartphone device. The new prototype would determine whether a Giemsa-stained thick blood smear sample is positive/negative for Plasmodium infection and its parasite levels. The whole system was integrated into the iMAGING smartphone application. CONCLUSION: The coalescence of the fully-automated system via auto-focus and slide movements and the autonomous detection of Plasmodium parasites in digital images with a smartphone software and AI algorithms confers the prototype the optimal features to join the global effort against malaria, neglected tropical diseases and other infectious diseases.

Title: Waterborne pathogens detection technologies: advances, challenges, and future perspectives.
Author: ['Oon YL', 'Oon YS', 'Ayaz M', 'Deng M', 'Li L', 'Song K']
Journal Title: Frontiers in microbiology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that pathogens like Escherichia coli, primarily linked to food and water contamination, are associated with 485,000 deaths from diarrheal diseases annually, translating to a staggering worldwide economic loss of nearly 12 billion USD per annum. International organizations like the WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have established related guidelines and criteria for pathogenic detection technologies and driving the search for innovative and efficient detection methods. This comprehensive review examines the trajectory of waterborne pathogenic bacteria detection technologies from traditional techniques, i.e., culture-based methods, to current detection methods including various forms of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques [qualitative real-time PCR, digital PCR, ELISA, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, next-generation sequencing (NGS)] and to emerging techniques, i.e., biosensors and artificial intelligence (AI). The scope of the review paper focuses on waterborne pathogenic bacteria that are recognized as human pathogens, posing tangible threats to public health through waterborne. The detection techniques' merits, constraints, research gaps and future perspectives are critically discussed. Advancements in digital droplet PCR, NGS and biosensors have significantly improved sensitivity and specificity, revolutionizing pathogen detection. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with these technologies has enhanced detection accuracy, enabling real-time analysis of large datasets. Molecular-based methods and biosensors show promise for efficient water quality monitoring, especially in resource-constrained settings, but on-site practical implementation remains a challenge. The pairwise comparison metrics used in this review also offer valuable insights into quick evaluation on the advantages, limitations and research gaps of various techniques, focusing on their applicability in field settings and timely analyses. Future research efforts should focus on developing robust, cost-effective and user-friendly techniques for routine waterborne bacteria monitoring, ultimately safeguarding global water supplies and public health, with AI and data analysis playing a crucial role in advancing these methods for a safer environment.

Journal Title: World journal of orthopedics
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 18
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Assessment of the potential utility of deep learning with subsequent image analysis to automate the measurement of hallux valgus and intermetatarsal angles from radiographs to serve as a preoperative aid in establishing hallux valgus severity for clinical decision-making. AIM: To investigate the accuracy of automated measurements of angles of hallux valgus from radiographs for further integration with the preoperative planning process. METHODS: The data comprises 265 consecutive digital anteroposterior weightbearing foot radiographs. 181 radiographs were utilized for training (161) and validating (20) a U-Net neural network to achieve a mean Sorensen-Dice index > 97% on bone segmentation. 84 test radiographs were used for manual (computer assisted) and automated measurements of hallux valgus severity determined by hallux valgus (HVA) and intermetatarsal angles (IMA). The reliability of manual and computer-based measurements was calculated using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Inter- and intraobserver reliability coefficients were also compared. An operative treatment recommendation was then applied to compare results between automated and manual angle measurements. RESULTS: Very high reliability was achieved for HVA and IMA between the manual measurements of three independent clinicians. For HVA, the ICC between manual measurements was 0.96-0.99. For IMA, ICC was 0.78-0.95. Comparing manual against automated computer measurement, the reliability was high as well. For HVA, absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC were 0.97, and SEM was 0.32. For IMA, absolute agreement ICC was 0.75, consistency ICC was 0.89, and SEM was 0.21. Additionally, a strong correlation (0.80) was observed between our approach and traditional clinical adjudication for preoperative planning of hallux valgus, according to an operative treatment algorithm proposed by EFORT. CONCLUSION: The proposed automated, artificial intelligence assisted determination of hallux valgus angles based on deep learning holds great potential as an accurate and efficient tool, with comparable accuracy to manual measurements by expert clinicians. Our approach can be effectively implemented in clinical practice to determine the angles of hallux valgus from radiographs, classify the deformity severity, streamline preoperative decision-making prior to corrective surgery.

Abstract: Chronic diseases within Indigenous communities constitute the most compelling ill-health burdens and treatment inequalities, particularly in rural and remote Australia. In response to these vital issues, a systematic literature review of the adoption of wearable, Artificial Intelligence-driven, electrocardiogram sensors, in a telehealth Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) context was conducted to scale up rural Indigenous health. To this end, four preselected scientific databases were chosen for data extraction to align with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. From the initially collected (n = 4436) articles, a total of 32 articles were analysed, being synthesised from the review inclusion criteria, maintaining strict eligibility and eliminating duplicates. None of the various studies found on this innovative healthcare intervention has given a comprehensive picture of how this could be an effective method of care dedicated to rural Indigenous communities with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Herein, we presented the unique concepts of IoMT-driven wearable biosensors tailored for rural indigenous cardiac patients, their clinical implications, and cardiovascular disease management within the telehealth domain. This work contributes to understanding the adoption of wearable IoMT sensor-driven telehealth model, highlighting the need for real-time data from First Nations patients in rural and remote areas for CVD prevention. Pertinent implications, research impacts, limitations and future research directions are endorsed, securing long-term Wearable IoMT sensor-driven telehealth sustainability.

Author: ['Huemann Z', 'Lee C', 'Hu J', 'Cho SY', 'Bradshaw TJ']
Journal Title: Radiology. Artificial intelligence
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of domain adaptation on the performance of language models in predicting five-point Deauville scores on the basis of clinical fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively retrieved 4542 text reports and images for fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT lymphoma examinations from 2008 to 2018 in the University of Wisconsin-Madison institutional clinical imaging database. Of these total reports, 1664 had Deauville scores that were extracted from the reports and served as training labels. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and initialized BERT models BioClinicalBERT, RadBERT, and RoBERTa were adapted to the nuclear medicine domain by pretraining using masked language modeling. These domain-adapted models were then compared with the non-domain-adapted versions on the task of five-point Deauville score prediction. The language models were compared against vision models, multimodal vision-language models, and a nuclear medicine physician, with sevenfold Monte Carlo cross-validation. Means and SDs for accuracy are reported, with P values from paired t testing. RESULTS: Domain adaptation improved the performance of all language models (P = .01). For example, BERT improved from 61.3% +/- 2.9 (SD) five-class accuracy to 65.7% +/- 2.2 (P = .01) following domain adaptation. Domain-adapted RoBERTa (named DA RoBERTa) performed best, achieving 77.4% +/- 3.4 five-class accuracy; this model performed similarly to its multimodal counterpart (named Multimodal DA RoBERTa) (77.2% +/- 3.2) and outperformed the best vision-only model (48.1% +/- 3.5, P </= .001). A physician given the task on a subset of the data had a five-class accuracy of 66%. CONCLUSION: Domain adaptation improved the performance of large language models in predicting Deauville scores in PET/CT reports.Keywords Lymphoma, PET, PET/CT, Transfer Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Nuclear Medicine, Deauville, Natural Language Processing, Multimodal Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Language Modeling Supplemental material is available for this article.

Author: ['Eby PR', 'Martis LM', 'Paluch JT', 'Pak JJ', 'Chan AHL']
Journal Title: Radiology. Artificial intelligence
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Poor positioning decreases mammography sensitivity and is arguably the single most important contributor to image quality (IQ). Inadequate IQ may subject patients to technical repeat views during the examination or return for technical recalls. Artificial intelligence (AI) software can objectively evaluate breast positioning and compression metrics for all images and technologists. This study assessed whether implementation of AI software across the authors' institution improved IQ and reduced rates of technical repeats and recalls (TR). From April 2019 to March 2022, TR was retrospectively evaluated for 40 technologists (198 054 images; Centricity electronic medical record system, GE HealthCare), and AI IQ metrics were available for 42 technologists (211 821 images; Analytics, Volpara Health Technologies). Diagnostic and digital breast tomosynthesis images and implant cases were excluded. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, chi(2), and paired t tests were used to evaluate whether AI IQ metrics and TR rates improved between the initial and most recent 12-month periods following AI software implementation (ie, baseline [April 2019 to March 2020] vs current [April 2021 to March 2022]). Comparing baseline with current periods, TR significantly reduced from 0.77% (788 of 102 953 images) to 0.17% (160 of 95 101 images), respectively (P < .001), and overall mean quality score improved by 6% ([2.42 - 2.28]/2.28; P = .001), demonstrating the potential of AI software to improve IQ and reduce patient TR.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: A Bayesian network is a graphical model that uses probability theory to represent relationships among its variables. The model is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes represent variables, such as the presence of a disease or an imaging finding. Connections between nodes express causal influences between variables as probability values. Bayesian networks can learn their structure (nodes and connections) and/or conditional probability values from data. Bayesian networks offer several advantages: (a) they can efficiently perform complex inferences, (b) reason from cause to effect or vice versa, (c) assess counterfactual data, (d) integrate observations with canonical ("textbook") knowledge, and (e) explain their reasoning. Bayesian networks have been employed in a wide variety of applications in radiology, including diagnosis and treatment planning. Unlike deep learning approaches, Bayesian networks have not been applied to computer vision. However, hybrid artificial intelligence systems have combined deep learning models with Bayesian networks, where the deep learning model identifies findings in medical images and the Bayesian network formulates and explains a diagnosis from those findings. One can apply a Bayesian network's probabilistic knowledge to integrate clinical and imaging findings to support diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making. This article reviews the fundamental principles of Bayesian networks and summarizes their applications in radiology.

Title: Use of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection and Triage of Cancer-associated Incidental Pulmonary Embolism.
Author: ['Wiklund P', 'Medson K']
Journal Title: Radiology. Artificial intelligence
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Incidental pulmonary embolism (iPE) is a common complication in patients with cancer, and there is often a delay in reporting these studies and a delay between the finalized report and time to treatment. In addition, unreported iPE is common. This retrospective single-center cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm on the report turnaround time, time to treatment, and detection rate in patients with cancer-associated iPE. Adult patients with cancer were included either before (July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019) or after (November 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021) implementation of an AI algorithm for iPE detection and triage. The results demonstrated that reported iPE prevalence was significantly higher in the period after AI implementation (2.5% [26 of 1036 studies] vs 0.8% [16 of 1892 studies], P < .001). Both report that the turnaround time (median, 0.66 hour vs 24.68 hours, P < .001) and time to treatment (median, 0.98 hour vs 28.05 hours, P < .001) were significantly shorter after AI implementation. In conclusion, the use of AI for detection and triage of iPE in clinical practice resulted in an increased detection rate of iPE and significantly shorter report turnaround time and time to treatment for patients with cancer-associated iPE.

Title: Accuracy of artificial intelligence model for infectious keratitis classification: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Author: ['Sarayar R', 'Lestari YD', 'Setio AAA', 'Sitompul R']
Journal Title: Frontiers in public health
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Infectious keratitis (IK) is a sight-threatening condition requiring immediate definite treatment. The need for prompt treatment heavily depends on timely diagnosis. The diagnosis of IK, however, is challenged by the drawbacks of the current "gold standard." The poorly differentiated clinical features, the possibility of low microbial culture yield, and the duration for culture are the culprits of delayed IK treatment. Deep learning (DL) is a recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancement that has been demonstrated to be highly promising in making automated diagnosis in IK with high accuracy. However, its exact accuracy is not yet elucidated. This article is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to assess the accuracy of available DL models to correctly classify IK based on etiology compared to the current gold standards. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Google Scholars, Proquest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane and Scopus. The used keywords are: "Keratitis," "Corneal ulcer," "Corneal diseases," "Corneal lesions," "Artificial intelligence," "Deep learning," and "Machine learning." Studies including slit lamp photography of the cornea and validity study on DL performance were considered. The primary outcomes reviewed were the accuracy and classification capability of the AI machine learning/DL algorithm. We analyzed the extracted data with the MetaXL 5.2 Software. RESULTS: A total of eleven articles from 2002 to 2022 were included with a total dataset of 34,070 images. All studies used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with ResNet and DenseNet models being the most used models across studies. Most AI models outperform the human counterparts with a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.851 and accuracy of 96.6% in differentiating IK vs. non-IK and pooled AUC 0.895 and accuracy of 64.38% for classifying bacterial keratitis (BK) vs. fungal keratitis (FK). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that DL algorithms have high potential in diagnosing and classifying IK with accuracy that, if not better, is comparable to trained corneal experts. However, various factors, such as the unique architecture of DL model, the problem with overfitting, image quality of the datasets, and the complex nature of IK itself, still hamper the universal applicability of DL in daily clinical practice.

Journal Title: Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: PURPOSE: The Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC) is a multi-institutional effort to accelerate medical imaging machine intelligence research and create a publicly available image repository/commons as well as a sequestered commons for performance evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms. After de-identification, approximately 80% of the medical images and associated metadata become part of the open commons and 20% are sequestered from the open commons. To ensure that both commons are representative of the population available, we introduced a stratified sampling method to balance the demographic characteristics across the two datasets. APPROACH: Our method uses multi-dimensional stratified sampling where several demographic variables of interest are sequentially used to separate the data into individual strata, each representing a unique combination of variables. Within each resulting stratum, patients are assigned to the open or sequestered commons. This algorithm was used on an example dataset containing 5000 patients using the variables of race, age, sex at birth, ethnicity, COVID-19 status, and image modality and compared resulting demographic distributions to naive random sampling of the dataset over 2000 independent trials. RESULTS: Resulting prevalence of each demographic variable matched the prevalence from the input dataset within one standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U test results supported the hypothesis that sequestration by stratified sampling provided more balanced subsets than naive randomization, except for demographic subcategories with very low prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The developed multi-dimensional stratified sampling algorithm can partition a large dataset while maintaining balance across several variables, superior to the balance achieved from naive randomization.

Title: Performance of artificial intelligence using cone-beam computed tomography for segmentation of oral and maxillofacial structures: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Author: ['Abesi F', 'Hozuri M', 'Zamani M']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical and experimental dentistry
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are different values reported about the performance of artificial intelligence using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for segmentation of oral and maxillofacial structures. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overall estimate to resolve the given conflicts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus through 31 October 2022, to identify studies evaluating artificial intelligence systems using oral and maxillofacial CBCT images for automatic segmentation of anatomical landmarks. The surveys had to report the outcome according to dice coefficient (DICE) or dice similarity coefficient (DSC) index. The estimates were presented as percent and 95% confidence interval (CI). I-squared index was used to assess the heterogeneity between the surveys. RESULTS: A total of 24 eligible studies were finally enrolled. The overall pooled DICE/DSC value for artificial intelligence was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95; I-squared=93.6%, p<0.001). Tooth and mandible were evaluated more than other anatomical regions (five studies for each one). The lowest and highest DICE/DSC scores for the artificial intelligence related to inferior alveolar nerve (0.55 [95% CI: 0.47-0.63]) and pharyngeal airway and sinonasal cavity (0.98 [95% CI: 0.98-1.00]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed excellent performance for the artificial intelligence regarding the segmentation task of oral and maxillofacial CBCT images. Key words:Artificial intelligence, cone-beam computed tomography, segmentation performance, dentistry.

Title: Ten questions to AI regarding the present and future of proteomics.
Author: ['Stransky S', 'Sun Y', 'Shi X', 'Sidoli S']
Journal Title: Frontiers in molecular biosciences
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The role of a scientist is at first not so different from a philosopher. They both need to question common thinking and evaluate whether reality is not as we always thought. Based on this, we need to design hypotheses, experiments, and analyses to prove our alternative vision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an "assistant" into a proper "colleague" for literature mining, data analysis and interpretation, and literally having (almost) real scientific conversations. However, being AI based on existing information, if we rely on it excessively will we still be able to question the status quo? In this article, we are particularly interested in discussing the future of proteomics and mass spectrometry with our new electronic collaborator. We leave to the reader the judgement whether the answers we received are satisfactory or superficial. What we were mostly interested in was laying down what we think are critical questions that the proteomics community should occasionally ask to itself. Proteomics has been around for more than 30 years, but it is still missing a few critical steps to fully address its promises as being the new genomics for clinical diagnostics and fundamental science, while becoming a user-friendly tool for every lab. Will we get there with the help of AI? And will these answers change in a short period, as AI continues to advance?

Title: Laparoscopic Projection Mapping of the Liver Portal Segment, Based on Augmented Reality Combined With Artificial Intelligence, for Laparoscopic Anatomical Liver Resection.
Author: ['Kasai M', 'Uchiyama H', 'Aihara T', 'Ikuta S', 'Yamanaka N']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma causes intrahepatic metastasis via the trans-portal vein. Thus, appropriate mapping of portal segments is necessary for laparoscopic anatomical liver resection. However, because of the difficulty in identifying tactile sensations and the limited surgical view of laparoscopy, augmented reality (AR) has recently been utilized in laparoscopic liver surgery to identify the tumor, vessels, and portal segments. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) has been employed to identify landmarks in two-dimensional (2D) images because of concerns regarding the accuracy of superimposing a three-dimensional (3D) model onto a 2D laparoscopic image. In this study, we report an AR-based projection mapping method of portal segments superimposing preoperative 3D models assisted by AI in laparoscopic surgery. The liver silhouette in laparoscopic images should be detected to superimpose 3D models. Labeled liver silhouettes were obtained from 380 images in surgical videos as learning images to implement AI-based silhouette detection. To implement this technique, we used Detectron2, a PyTorch-based object detection library by Facebook AI Research (Now, Meta AI, Menlo Park, California, United States). In the videos, the liver edges were displayed as green outlines according to AI. Additionally, 3D liver models with segmental mapping were generated using the open-source software 3D Slicer from computed tomography images. For AR display, we utilized the model target function of Vuforia SDK (PTC, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States), an industrial AR library with silhouette-based AR display. Lastly, we merged the AI output video with a 3D model in Unity (Unity Software Inc., San Francisco, California, United States) to establish the projection mapping of the portal segment on 2D surgical images. The accuracy was assessed by measuring the maximum error between the liver edges of laparoscopic images and 3D liver silhouettes in five surgical videos. The maximum error between liver edges and 3D model silhouettes ranged from 4 mm to 22 mm in the AI-based approach and 12 mm to 55 mm in the non-AI-based approach. Meanwhile, the mean error was 14.5 and 31.2 mm in the AI-based and non-AI-based approaches, respectively. Despite camera movement, 3D AR displays were maintained. Thus, our AI-assisted projection mapping of the portal segment could offer a new approach for laparoscopic anatomical liver resection.

Title: Towards Ideal Health Ecosystem With Artificial Intelligence-Driven Medical Services in India: An Overview.
Author: ['Kumar D', 'Ingole A', 'Choudhari SG']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has immense power to set up an ideal health ecosystem through "intelligent medicine" i.e., a combination of human and machine intelligence. However, the application of AI in healthcare is still unclear. Currently, India is facing huge challenges such as the scarcity of medical resources and the uneven distribution of medical services. This also highlights the opportunities linked to challenges and risks. The most recent pandemic has accelerated this process by acknowledging that medicine stands on the brink of an AI revolution. Incorporating the evidence on the role of precision medicine, cost-effective healthcare, and expanding humanistic and medical services, this paper demonstrates the digital health interventions for the "enhancement" of capabilities, "efficiency," "extension of services" and upgrading "experience" in the health sector. Through thorough literature searches from PubMed, Google Scholar, and other reliable sources, this study aims to understand the evolving needs, and greater control and to bridge gaps in access to healthcare through AI. Also, India is currently developing the potential to automate multiple tasks and calling for more human interventions. The future of AI in healthcare looks promising with digital health interventions that eventually offer flexibility and convenience to both the patient and the provider. This paper will help public health professionals address ethical considerations and policy-making where AI plays a significant role in setting up an ideal health ecosystem.
