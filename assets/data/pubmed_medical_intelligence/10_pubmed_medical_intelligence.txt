Author: ['Lotz JC', 'Ropella G', 'Anderson P', 'Yang Q', 'Hedderich MA', 'Bailey J', 'Hunt CA']
Journal Title: JOR spine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Chronic low back pain (LBP) is influenced by a broad spectrum of patient-specific factors as codified in domains of the biopsychosocial model (BSM). Operationalizing the BSM into research and clinical care is challenging because most investigators work in silos that concentrate on only one or two BSM domains. Furthermore, the expanding, multidisciplinary nature of BSM research creates practical limitations as to how individual investigators integrate current data into their processes of generating impactful hypotheses. The rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence (AI) is providing new tools for organizing knowledge, but the practical aspects for how AI may advance LBP research and clinical are beginning to be explored. The goals of the work presented here are to: (1) explore the current capabilities of knowledge integration technologies (large language models (LLM), similarity graphs (SGs), and knowledge graphs (KGs)) to synthesize biomedical literature and depict multimodal relationships reflected in the BSM, and; (2) highlight limitations, implementation details, and future areas of research to improve performance. We demonstrate preliminary evidence that LLMs, like GPT-3, may be useful in helping scientists analyze and distinguish cLBP publications across multiple BSM domains and determine the degree to which the literature supports or contradicts emergent hypotheses. We show that SG representations and KGs enable exploring LBP's literature in novel ways, possibly providing, trans-disciplinary perspectives or insights that are currently difficult, if not infeasible to achieve. The SG approach is automated, simple, and inexpensive to execute, and thereby may be useful for early-phase literature and narrative explorations beyond one's areas of expertise. Likewise, we show that KGs can be constructed using automated pipelines, queried to provide semantic information, and analyzed to explore trans-domain linkages. The examples presented support the feasibility for LBP-tailored AI protocols to organize knowledge and support developing and refining trans-domain hypotheses.

Author: ['Ding Y', 'Jing J', 'Guo Q', 'Zhou J', 'Cheng X', 'Chen X', 'Wang L', 'Tang Y', 'Fan Q']
Journal Title: General psychiatry
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Music therapy is a promising complementary intervention for addressing various mental health conditions. Despite evidence of the beneficial effects of music, the acoustic features that make music effective in therapeutic contexts remain elusive. AIMS: This study aimed to identify and validate distinctive acoustic features of healing music. METHODS: We constructed a healing music dataset (HMD) based on nominations from related professionals and extracted 370 acoustic features. Healing-distinctive acoustic features were identified as those that were (1) independent from genre within the HMD, (2) significantly different from music pieces in a classical music dataset (CMD) and (3) similar to pieces in a five-element music dataset (FEMD). We validated the identified features by comparing jazz pieces in the HMD with a jazz music dataset (JMD). We also examined the emotional properties of the features in a Chinese affective music system (CAMS). RESULTS: The HMD comprised 165 pieces. Among all the acoustic features, 74.59% shared commonalities across genres, and 26.22% significantly differed between the HMD classical pieces and the CMD. The equivalence test showed that the HMD and FEMD did not differ significantly in 9.46% of the features. The potential healing-distinctive acoustic features were identified as the standard deviation of the roughness, mean and period entropy of the third coefficient of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. In a three-dimensional space defined by these features, HMD's jazz pieces could be distinguished from those of the JMD. These three features could significantly predict both subjective valence and arousal ratings in the CAMS. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctive acoustic features of healing music that have been identified and validated in this study have implications for the development of artificial intelligence models for identifying therapeutic music, particularly in contexts where access to professional expertise may be limited. This study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the potential of digital technologies for healthcare interventions.

Title: Role of Complement-dependent Cytotoxicity Crossmatch and HLA Typing in Solid Organ Transplant.
Author: ['Tiwari A', 'Mukherjee S']
Journal Title: Reviews on recent clinical trials
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplantation is a life-saving medical operation that has progressed greatly because of developments in diagnostic tools and histocompatibility tests. Crossmatching for complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are two important methods for checking graft compatibility and reducing the risk of graft rejection. HLA typing and CDC crossmatching are critical in kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, intestine, and multi-organ transplantation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on the internet, using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, to identify peer-reviewed publications about solid organ transplants, HLA typing, and CDC crossmatching. CONCLUSION: Recent advances in HLA typing have allowed for high-resolution evaluation, epitope matching, and personalized therapy methods. Genomic profiling, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence have improved HLA typing precision, resulting in better patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven virtual crossmatching and predictive algorithms have eliminated the requirement for physical crossmatching in the context of CDC crossmatching, boosting organ allocation and transplant efficiency. This review elaborates on the importance of HLA typing and CDC crossmatching in solid organ transplantation.

Title: Instantaneous CO(2) emission modelling for a Euro 6 start-stop vehicle based on portable emission measurement system data and artificial intelligence methods.
Author: ['Madziel M']
Journal Title: Environmental science and pollution research international
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: One of the increasingly common methods to counteract the increased fuel consumption of vehicles is start-stop technology. This paper introduces a methodology which presents the process of measuring and creating a computational model of CO(2) emissions using artificial intelligence techniques for a vehicle equipped with start-stop technology. The method requires only measurement data of velocity, acceleration of vehicle, and gradient of road to predict the emission of CO(2). In this paper, three methods of machine learning techniques were analyzed, while the best prediction results are shown by the gradient boosting method. For the developed models, the results were validated using the coefficient of determination, the mean squared error, and based on visual evaluation of residual and instantaneous emission plots and CO(2) emission maps. The developed models present a novel methodology and can be used for microscale environmental analysis.

Title: Auditing the inference processes of medical-image classifiers by leveraging generative AI and the expertise of physicians.
Author: ['DeGrave AJ', 'Cai ZR', 'Janizek JD', 'Daneshjou R', 'Lee SI']
Journal Title: Nature biomedical engineering
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: The inferences of most machine-learning models powering medical artificial intelligence are difficult to interpret. Here we report a general framework for model auditing that combines insights from medical experts with a highly expressive form of explainable artificial intelligence. Specifically, we leveraged the expertise of dermatologists for the clinical task of differentiating melanomas from melanoma 'lookalikes' on the basis of dermoscopic and clinical images of the skin, and the power of generative models to render 'counterfactual' images to understand the 'reasoning' processes of five medical-image classifiers. By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance. The framework can be applied to any specialized medical domain to make the powerful inference processes of machine-learning models medically understandable.

Abstract: Quantitative Gait Analysis (QGA) is considered as an objective measure of gait performance. In this study, we aim at designing an artificial intelligence that can efficiently predict the progression of gait quality using kinematic data obtained from QGA. For this purpose, a gait database collected from 734 patients with gait disorders is used. As the patient walks, kinematic data is collected during the gait session. This data is processed to generate the Gait Profile Score (GPS) for each gait cycle. Tracking potential GPS variations enables detecting changes in gait quality. In this regard, our work is driven by predicting such future variations. Two approaches were considered: signal-based and image-based. The signal-based one uses raw gait cycles, while the image-based one employs a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D FFT) representation of gait cycles. Several architectures were developed, and the obtained Area Under the Curve (AUC) was above 0.72 for both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to apply neural networks for gait prediction tasks.

Title: Neuroimaging and artificial intelligence for assessment of chronic painful temporomandibular disorders-a comprehensive review.
Author: ['Shrivastava M', 'Ye L']
Journal Title: International journal of oral science
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: Chronic Painful Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) are challenging to diagnose and manage due to their complexity and lack of understanding of brain mechanism. In the past few decades' neural mechanisms of pain regulation and perception have been clarified by neuroimaging research. Advances in the neuroimaging have bridged the gap between brain activity and the subjective experience of pain. Neuroimaging has also made strides toward separating the neural mechanisms underlying the chronic painful TMD. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors by automating tasks that previously required humans' intelligence to complete. AI has started to contribute to the recognition, assessment, and understanding of painful TMD. The application of AI and neuroimaging in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of chronic painful TMD are still in its early stages. The objective of the present review is to identify the contemporary neuroimaging approaches such as structural, functional, and molecular techniques that have been used to investigate the brain of chronic painful TMD individuals. Furthermore, this review guides practitioners on relevant aspects of AI and how AI and neuroimaging methods can revolutionize our understanding on the mechanisms of painful TMD and aid in both diagnosis and management to enhance patient outcomes.

Journal Title: European journal of haematology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-anemic thalassemia trait (TT) accounted for a high proportion of TT cases in South China. OBJECTIVE: To use artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of erythrocyte morphology and machine learning (ML) to identify TT gene carriers in a non-anemic population. METHODS: Digital morphological data from 76 TT gene carriers and 97 controls were collected. The AI technology-based Mindray MC-100i was used to quantitatively analyze the percentage of abnormal erythrocytes. Further, ML was used to construct a prediction model. RESULTS: Non-anemic TT carriers accounted for over 60% of the TT cases. Random Forest was selected as the prediction model and named TT@Normal. The TT@Normal algorithm showed outstanding performance in the training, validation, and external validation sets and could efficiently identify TT carriers in the non-anemic population. The top three weights in the TT@Normal model were the target cells, microcytes, and teardrop cells. Elevated percentages of abnormal erythrocytes should raise a strong suspicion of being a TT gene carrier. TT@Normal could be promoted and used as a visualization and sharing tool. It is accessible through a URL link and can be used by medical staff online to predict the possibility of TT gene carriage in a non-anemic population. CONCLUSIONS: The ML-based model TT@Normal could efficiently identify TT carriers in non-anemic people. Elevated percentages of target cells, microcytes, and teardrop cells should raise a strong suspicion of being a TT gene carrier.

Abstract: Endometrial biopsies are important in the diagnostic work-up of women who present with abnormal uterine bleeding or women with hereditary risk of endometrial cancer. In general, about 10% of all endometrial biopsies demonstrate endometrial (pre)malignancy that requires specific treatment. As the diagnostic evaluation of mostly benign cases results in a substantial workload for pathologists, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted pre-selection of biopsies could optimize the workflow. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of AI-assisted diagnosis for endometrial biopsies (ENDO-AID), trained on daily-practice whole slide images instead of highly selected images. Endometrial biopsies were classified into six clinically relevant categories defined as: non-representative, normal, non-neoplastic, hyperplasia without atypia, hyperplasia with atypia and malignant. The agreement among 15 pathologists, within these classifications, was evaluated in 91 endometrial biopsies. Next, an algorithm (trained on a total of 2,819 endometrial biopsies) rated the same 91 cases and we compared its performance using the pathologist's classification as reference standard. The interrater reliability among pathologists was moderate with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.51, whereas for a binary classification into benign versus (pre)malignant, the agreement was substantial with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.66. The AI algorithm performed slightly worse for the six categories with a moderate Cohen's kappa of 0.43, but was comparable for the binary classification with a substantial Cohen's kappa of 0.65. AI-assisted diagnosis of endometrial biopsies was demonstrated to be feasible in discriminating between benign and (pre)malignant endometrial tissue, even when trained on unselected cases. Endometrial premalignancies remain challenging for both pathologists and AI algorithms. Future steps to improve reliability of the diagnosis are needed to achieve a more refined AI-assisted diagnostic solution for endometrial biopsies that covers both premalignant and malignant diagnoses.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated exceptional performance in mitosis identification and quantification. However, the implementation of AI in clinical practice needs to be evaluated against the existing methods. This study is aimed at assessing the optimal method of using AI-based mitotic figure scoring in breast cancer (BC). We utilized whole slide images (WSIs) from a large cohort of BC with extended follow-up comprising a discovery (n=1715) and a validation (n=859) set (Nottingham cohort). The TCGA-BRCA cohort (n=757) was used as an external test set. Employing automated mitosis detection, the mitotic count was assessed using three different methods, the mitotic count per tumor area (MCT; calculated by dividing the number of mitotic figures by the total tumor area), the mitotic index (MI; defined as the average number of mitotic figures per 1000 malignant cells), and the mitotic activity index (MAI; defined as the number of mitotic figures in 3mm(2) area within the mitotic hotspot). These automated metrics were evaluated and compared based on their correlation with the well-established visual scoring method of the Nottingham grading system (NGS) as well as Ki67 score, clinicopathological parameters, and patient outcome. AI-based mitotic scores derived from the three methods (MCT, MI and MAI) were significantly correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics and patient's survival (p<0.001). However, the mitotic counts and the derived cut-offs varied significantly between the 3 methods. Only MAI and MCT were positively correlated with the gold standard visual scoring method used in NGS (r=0.8 and r=0.7 respectively), as well as Ki67 score (r=0.69 and r=0.55 respectively) and MAI was the only independent predictor of survival (p<0.05) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. For clinical applications, the optimum method of scoring mitosis using AI needs to be considered. MAI can provide reliable and reproducible results and can accurately quantify mitotic figures in BC.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 23
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most accessible and comprehensive diagnostic tools used to assess cardiac patients at the first point of contact. Despite advances in computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (CIE), its accuracy remains inferior to physicians. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ECG system and compared its performance to current state-of-the-art CIE. METHODS: An AI-powered system consisting of 6 deep neural networks (DNN) was trained on standard 12‑lead ECGs to detect 20 essential diagnostic patterns (grouped into 6 categories: rhythm, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), conduction abnormalities, ectopy, chamber enlargement and axis). An independent test set of ECGs with diagnostic consensus of two expert cardiologists was used as a reference standard. AI system performance was compared to current state-of-the-art CIE. The key metrics used to compare performances were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. RESULTS: A total of 932,711 standard 12‑lead ECGs from 173,949 patients were used for AI system development. The independent test set pooled 11,932 annotated ECG labels. In all 6 diagnostic categories, the DNNs achieved high F1 scores: Rhythm 0.957, ACS 0.925, Conduction abnormalities 0.893, Ectopy 0.966, Chamber enlargement 0.972, and Axis 0.897. The diagnostic performance of DNNs surpassed state-of-the-art CIE for the 13 out of 20 essential diagnostic patterns and was non-inferior for the remaining individual diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the AI-powered ECG model's ability to accurately identify electrocardiographic abnormalities from the 12‑lead ECG, highlighting its potential as a clinical tool for healthcare professionals.

Title: Dynamic Model Interpretation-Guided Online Active Learning Scheme for Real-Time Safety Assessment.
Author: ['He X', 'Liu Z']
Journal Title: IEEE transactions on cybernetics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: Chunk-level real-time safety assessment of dynamic systems is a critical component of industrial processes, which is essential to prevent hazards and reduce the risk of injury or damage to equipment and facilities, especially in nonstationary environments. In this context, multiple real and complex concept drifts are inevitable in industrial settings, making it crucial to understand their detection and adaptation processes. The incremental learning scheme should also be well considered. However, existing methods have certain limitations in dealing with such issues. In this article, a dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme, termed a dynamic model interpretation-guided learning scheme (DMI-LS), is proposed. Specifically, the model update strategy with chunk data is designed based on the implementation of the broad learning system. A novel query strategy is then investigated to consider the ranking preference difference, which relies on the interpretation generated by the explainable artificial intelligence method. Several experiments based on the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to verify the effects of the proposed DMI-LS. The results show that it outperforms the other advanced existing approaches with different settings in most scenarios.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are capable of generating grammatically perfect and human-like text content, and a large number of ChatGPT-generated texts have appeared on the internet. However, medical texts, such as clinical notes and diagnoses, require rigorous validation, and erroneous medical content generated by ChatGPT could potentially lead to disinformation that poses significant harm to health care and the general public. OBJECTIVE: This study is among the first on responsible artificial intelligence-generated content in medicine. We focus on analyzing the differences between medical texts written by human experts and those generated by ChatGPT and designing machine learning workflows to effectively detect and differentiate medical texts generated by ChatGPT. METHODS: We first constructed a suite of data sets containing medical texts written by human experts and generated by ChatGPT. We analyzed the linguistic features of these 2 types of content and uncovered differences in vocabulary, parts-of-speech, dependency, sentiment, perplexity, and other aspects. Finally, we designed and implemented machine learning methods to detect medical text generated by ChatGPT. The data and code used in this paper are published on GitHub. RESULTS: Medical texts written by humans were more concrete, more diverse, and typically contained more useful information, while medical texts generated by ChatGPT paid more attention to fluency and logic and usually expressed general terminologies rather than effective information specific to the context of the problem. A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers-based model effectively detected medical texts generated by ChatGPT, and the F(1) score exceeded 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Although text generated by ChatGPT is grammatically perfect and human-like, the linguistic characteristics of generated medical texts were different from those written by human experts. Medical text generated by ChatGPT could be effectively detected by the proposed machine learning algorithms. This study provides a pathway toward trustworthy and accountable use of large language models in medicine.

Title: Exploring the Potential of ChatGPT-4 in Predicting Refractive Surgery Categorizations: Comparative Study.
Author: ['Cirkovic A', 'Katz T']
Journal Title: JMIR formative research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Refractive surgery research aims to optimally precategorize patients by their suitability for various types of surgery. Recent advances have led to the development of artificial intelligence-powered algorithms, including machine learning approaches, to assess risks and enhance workflow. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI LP) have emerged as potential general artificial intelligence tools that can assist across various disciplines, possibly including refractive surgery decision-making. However, their actual capabilities in precategorizing refractive surgery patients based on real-world parameters remain unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to validate ChatGPT-4's capabilities in precategorizing refractive surgery patients based on commonly used clinical parameters. The goal was to assess whether ChatGPT-4's performance when categorizing batch inputs is comparable to those made by a refractive surgeon. A simple binary set of categories (patient suitable for laser refractive surgery or not) as well as a more detailed set were compared. METHODS: Data from 100 consecutive patients from a refractive clinic were anonymized and analyzed. Parameters included age, sex, manifest refraction, visual acuity, and various corneal measurements and indices from Scheimpflug imaging. This study compared ChatGPT-4's performance with a clinician's categorizations using Cohen kappa coefficient, a chi-square test, a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F(1)-score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve. RESULTS: A statistically significant noncoincidental accordance was found between ChatGPT-4 and the clinician's categorizations with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.399 for 6 categories (95% CI 0.256-0.537) and 0.610 for binary categorization (95% CI 0.372-0.792). The model showed temporal instability and response variability, however. The chi-square test on 6 categories indicated an association between the 2 raters' distributions (chi(2)(5)=94.7, P<.001). Here, the accuracy was 0.68, precision 0.75, recall 0.68, and F(1)-score 0.70. For 2 categories, the accuracy was 0.88, precision 0.88, recall 0.88, F(1)-score 0.88, and area under the curve 0.79. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that ChatGPT-4 exhibits potential as a precategorization tool in refractive surgery, showing promising agreement with clinician categorizations. However, its main limitations include, among others, dependency on solely one human rater, small sample size, the instability and variability of ChatGPT's (OpenAI LP) output between iterations and nontransparency of the underlying models. The results encourage further exploration into the application of LLMs like ChatGPT-4 in health care, particularly in decision-making processes that require understanding vast clinical data. Future research should focus on defining the model's accuracy with prompt and vignette standardization, detecting confounding factors, and comparing to other versions of ChatGPT-4 and other LLMs to pave the way for larger-scale validation and real-world implementation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Traditional health care systems face long-standing challenges, including patient diversity, geographical disparities, and financial constraints. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers solutions to these challenges. AI, a multidisciplinary field, enhances clinical decision-making. However, imbalanced AI models may enhance health disparities. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to investigate the economic performance and equity impact of AI in diagnostic imaging for skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. The research question is "To what extent does the use of AI in imaging exams for diagnosing skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases result in improved economic outcomes, and does it promote equity in health care systems?" METHODS: The study is a systematic review of economic and equity evaluations following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) guidelines. Eligibility criteria include articles reporting on economic evaluations or equity considerations related to AI-based diagnostic imaging for specified diseases. Data will be collected from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists. Data quality and transferability will be assessed according to CHEC (Consensus on Health Economic Criteria), EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project), and Welte checklists. RESULTS: This systematic review began in March 2023. The literature search identified 9,526 publications and, after full-text screening, 9 publications were included in the study. We plan to submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal once it is finalized, with an expected completion date in January 2024. CONCLUSIONS: AI in diagnostic imaging offers potential benefits but also raises concerns about equity and economic impact. Bias in algorithms and disparities in access may hinder equitable outcomes. Evaluating the economic viability of AI applications is essential for resource allocation and affordability. Policy makers and health care stakeholders can benefit from this review's insights to make informed decisions. Limitations, including study variability and publication bias, will be considered in the analysis. This systematic review will provide valuable insights into the economic and equity implications of AI in diagnostic imaging. It aims to inform evidence-based decision-making and contribute to more efficient and equitable health care systems. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/48544.

Abstract: According to Cambridge Dictionary, Funnel is an object that has a wide round opening at the top, sloping sides, and a narrow tube at the bottom, used for pouring liquids or powders into containers with narrow necks.From an semplified anatomic point of view, the skull base along with its offshoot, the spine, replicate a bone funnel as a vessel sustaining the brain, the cerebellum and the spinal cord along with cranial and radicular nerves. Non doubt at all that the knowledge of the embryology, anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and the more effective surgical pathways to engage and remove surgical diseases is of paramount importance in the surgical cultural heritage to be strongly encouraged and supported in young neurosurgeons.So to the steps that seem to emerge from this Issue of Acta Neurochirurgica suppl are exploratory, strategic, tactical and finally operational. From the skull base to the sacrum we meet a macrosystem of anatomic and functional complex network with a common embryological hystory as well as contiguity. Different skills are necessary to face with a 360 degrees  universe of functions and diseases to deal with. Intelligence and culture as knowledge of both anatomy and pathology help to elaborate the STRATEGY while technical and manual supports are part of the TACTIC armamentarium which is proactive and determinant to the final OPERATIONAL step.

Abstract: Objective: To identify outcome predictors in hospitalized youth with mental disorders. Methods: This retrospective analysis of systematically recorded clinical parameters in youth hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in 2004-2015 assessed magnitude and correlates of symptom response (SR), global illness response (GIR), social functioning (SF), out-of-home placement (OOHP), and length of stay (LOS). Backward elimination regression analyses were performed to identify independent baseline correlates of each of the 5 outcomes, with R(2) representing the variance explained by the independent correlates retained in the final model. Results: Across 1,189 youth (median age = 14.4 years; interquartile range = 11.6,16.1 years; range, 5-19 years; females = 61.5%), frequencies of coprimary outcomes were as follows: SR = 57.5% (statistically significant correlates = 13, R(2) = 0.154), GIR = 30.0% (correlates = 5, R(2) = 0.078), SF = 19.0% (correlates = 8, R(2) = 0.207), OOHP recommendation = 35.2% (correlates = 13, R(2) = 0.275), and mean +/- SD LOS = 65.0 +/- 37.5 days (correlates = 11, R(2) = 0.219). In multivariable analyses, 11 factors were statistically significantly (P < .05) associated with > 1 poor outcome: 4 with 4 outcomes (disturbed social interaction, substance abuse/dependence symptoms; sole exception for both = LOS; disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, sole exception = OOHP; higher admission BMI percentile [but shorter LOS], sole exception = GIR), 3 with 3 outcomes (higher admission age [but good SF and shorter LOS], more abnormal psychosocial circumstances, more mental health diagnoses), and 4 with 2 outcomes (intelligence level [IQ] < 85, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, disturbed social behavior, somatic findings). Additionally, 17 correlates were statistically significantly (P < .05) associated with 1 outcome, ie, SR = 6, OOHP = 5, LOS = 5, SF = 1. Conclusions: Higher admission BMI percentile, disturbed social interaction, disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, and substance abuse/dependence symptoms were independently associated with multiple poor outcomes in mentally ill youth requiring inpatient care. Knowledge of global and specific correlates of poor inpatient treatment outcomes may help inform treatment decisions.
