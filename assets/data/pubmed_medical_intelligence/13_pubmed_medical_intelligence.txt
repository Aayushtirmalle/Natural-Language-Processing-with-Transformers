Author: ['Ghods K', 'Azizi A', 'Jafari A', 'Ghods K']
Journal Title: Journal of dentistry (Shiraz, Iran)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular in dentistry because it facilitates the process of diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, AI holds multiple prominent drawbacks, which restrict its wide application today. It is necessary for dentists to be aware of AI's pros and cons before its implementation. PURPOSE: Therefore, the present study was conducted to comprehensively review various applications of AI in all dental branches along with its advantages and disadvantages. MATERIALS AND METHOD: For this review article, a complete query was carried out on PubMed and Google Scholar databases and the studies published during 2010-2022 were collected using the keywords "Artificial Intelligence", "Dentistry," "Machine learning," "Deep learning," and "Diagnostic System." Ultimately, 116 relevant articles focused on artificial intelligence in dentistry were selected and evaluated. RESULTS: In new research AI applications in detecting dental abnormalities and oral malignancies based on radiographic view and histopathological features, designing dental implants and crowns, determining tooth preparation finishing line, analyzing growth patterns, estimating biological age, predicting the viability of dental pulp stem cells, analyzing the gene expression of periapical lesions, forensic dentistry, and predicting the success rate of treatments, have been mentioned. Despite AI's benefits in clinical dentistry, three controversial challenges including ease of use, financial return on investment, and evidence of performance exist and need to be managed. CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, the most crucial progression of AI is in oral malignancies' diagnostic systems. However, AI's newest advancements in various branches of dentistry require further scientific work before being applied to clinical practice. Moreover, the immense use of AI in clinical dentistry is only achievable when its challenges are appropriately managed.

Author: ['Ohayon MM', 'Duhoux S', 'Grieco J', 'Cote ML']
Journal Title: Sleep medicine: X
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of Narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 and to determine the prevalence of narcolepsy diagnosis criteria in the US general population. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in the adult US general population in two occasions. The initial interviews included 15 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming). The follow-up interviews, was done three years later in eight of these states. Of the 19,136 contacted individuals, 15,929 completed the initial interview and 10,931 completed the follow-up. Participants were interviewed using the Sleep-EVAL system, an artificial intelligence tool. Narcolepsy Type 1 (with cataplexy) and Narcolepsy Type 2 (without cataplexy) were defined according to the ICSD-3 classification. Symptoms of narcolepsy were assessed by frequency per week and duration. Medical visits and diagnoses were also collected. RESULTS: Participants were aged between 18 and 102 years of age (mean 45.8 +/- 17.9 years), 51.3 % were women. The prevalence of narcolepsy with cataplexy was 12.6 per 100,000 individuals (95 % C.I., 0 to 30) and narcolepsy without cataplexy was 25.1 per 100,000. The incidence per year was 2.6 per 100,000 individuals (95 % C.I., 0 to 11). CONCLUSIONS: Narcolepsy is a rare condition affecting 37.7/100,000 individuals (126,191 individuals in the current US population). Our US general population prevalence is in line with rates found in community-based studies but lower than what is reported in claim database studies.

Title: AI/ML advances in non-small cell lung cancer biomarker discovery.
Author: ['Caliskan M', 'Tazaki K']
Journal Title: Frontiers in oncology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women, representing approximately 25% of cancer fatalities each year. The treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly evolving due to the progress made in biomarker-driven targeted therapies. While advancements in targeted treatments have improved survival rates for NSCLC patients with actionable biomarkers, long-term survival remains low, with an overall 5-year relative survival rate below 20%. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms have shown promise in biomarker discovery, yet NSCLC-specific studies capturing the clinical challenges targeted and emerging patterns identified using AI/ML approaches are lacking. Here, we employed a text-mining approach and identified 215 studies that reported potential biomarkers of NSCLC using AI/ML algorithms. We catalogued these studies with respect to BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) biomarker sub-types and summarized emerging patterns and trends in AI/ML-driven NSCLC biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our comprehensive review will contribute to the current understanding of AI/ML advances in NSCLC biomarker research and provide an important catalogue that may facilitate clinical adoption of AI/ML-derived biomarkers.

Publication Date: 2022 Dec
Abstract: Delays in the identification of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients are a major barrier to the development of effective interventions to treat AKI. A recent study by Tomasev and colleagues at DeepMind described a model that achieved a state-of-the-art performance in predicting AKI up to 48 hours in advance.(1) Because this model was trained in a population of US Veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its reproducibility and generalizability. In this study, we aimed to reproduce key aspects of this model, trained and evaluated it in a similar population of US Veterans, and evaluated its generalizability in a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting AKI in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of AKI and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of AKI. We demonstrate that while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-Veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in Veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of reproducing artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of rehabilitation with sensory glove (SG) and virtual reality (VR) on changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration and amplitude and latency of event related potential (ERP) P300 in the early rehabilitation period after hemispheric ischemic stroke (IS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients (mean age 58.0+/-9.7 years, time after stroke onset - 3.8+/-1.6 months) were randomized into intervention (IG) and control (CG) groups. Patients in both groups received 15 sessions of rehabilitation (30 min, 3 times a week). Patients in the IG (n=46) received rehabilitation with SG and VR. Patients in CG (n=44) received individualized physical therapy. The end points were a change in the MMSE, MoCA, 10-word Luria test, subtests of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS IV) test, amplitude and latency of P300, and BDNF concentration on admission and at the end of rehabilitation. RESULTS: There was an improvement on MoCA test (p=0.049) and working memory index of the WAIS IV test (p=0.045) iIn the IG after completing rehabilitation the improvement on MoCA test (p=0.049) and working memory index of the WAIS IV test (p=0.045) was observed. There was aA trend tendency towards an significant increase on MMSE (p=0.093) and 10-word Luria test (p=0.052) was observed. In CG, an improvement with a trend towards significant differences (p</=0.12) on all above mentioned tests was also observednoted. In both groups there were no significant changes in the amplitude or latency of P300. Concentration of BDNF increased significantly in the IG (p=0.042), while in the CG a tendency (p=0.064) was observed (p=0.064). By the end of rehabilitation, the delta between groups in the increase of BDNF concentration was 17.9%, p=0.072. In both groups, there was a correlation between scores on cognitive tests and BDNF concentration. Absence/presence of cognitive disorders was not associated with initial or final BDNF concentrations or delta between groups. RESULTS: In the IG after completing rehabilitation the improvement on MoCA test (p=0.049) and working memory index of the WAIS IV test (p=0.045) was observed. There was a tendency towards significant increase on MMSE (p=0.093) and 10 word Luria test (p=0.052). In CG an improvement with a trend towards significant differences (p</=0.12) on all above mentioned tests was also observed. In both groups there were no significant changes in the amplitude or latency of P300. Concentration of BDNF increased significantly in the IG (p=0.042), while in the CG a tendency was observed (p=0.064). By the end of rehabilitation, the delta between groups in the increase of BDNF concentration was 17.9%, p=0.072. In both groups there was a correlation between scores on cognitive tests and BDNF concentration. Absence/presence of cognitive disorders was not associated with initial or final BDNF concentration or delta between groups. CONCLUSION: VR and SG in the early rehabilitation period after IS is are as equally effective as rehabilitation with individualized physical therapy (aerobic training) in increasing BDNF concentration and in improvement on cognitive tests.

Journal Title: Signal transduction and targeted therapy
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: In 2022, a global outbreak of Mpox (formerly monkeypox) occurred in various countries across Europe and America and rapidly spread to more than 100 countries and regions. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of the Mpox virus. Consequently, nations intensified their efforts to explore treatment strategies aimed at combating the infection and its dissemination. Nevertheless, the available therapeutic options for Mpox virus infection remain limited. So far, only a few numbers of antiviral compounds have been approved by regulatory authorities. Given the high mutability of the Mpox virus, certain mutant strains have shown resistance to existing pharmaceutical interventions. This highlights the urgent need to develop novel antiviral drugs that can combat both drug resistance and the potential threat of bioterrorism. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive literature on the pathophysiology and treatment of Mpox. To address this issue, we conducted a review covering the physiological and pathological processes of Mpox infection, summarizing the latest progress of anti-Mpox drugs. Our analysis encompasses approved drugs currently employed in clinical settings, as well as newly identified small-molecule compounds and antibody drugs displaying potential antiviral efficacy against Mpox. Furthermore, we have gained valuable insights from the process of Mpox drug development, including strategies for repurposing drugs, the discovery of drug targets driven by artificial intelligence, and preclinical drug development. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on Mpox.

Abstract: Implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) is a complex and challenging task. Computer technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been explored to promote the CPG implementation. This study has reviewed the main domains where computer technology and AI has been applied to CPG implementation. PubMed, Embase, Web of science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, WanFang DATA, VIP database, and China Biology Medicine disc database were searched from inception to December 2021. Studies involving the utilization of computer technology and AI to promote the implementation of CPGs were eligible for review. A total of 10429 published articles were identified, 117 met the inclusion criteria. 21 (17.9%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to classify or extract the relative content of CPGs, such as recommendation sentence, condition-action sentences. 47 (40.2%) focused on the utilization of computer technology to represent guideline knowledge to make it understandable by computer. 15 (12.8%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to verify the relative content of CPGs, such as conciliation of multiple single-disease guidelines for comorbid patients. 34 (29.1%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to integrate guideline knowledge into different resources, such as clinical decision support systems. We conclude that the application of computer technology and AI to CPG implementation mainly concentrated on the guideline content classification and extraction, guideline knowledge representation, guideline knowledge verification, and guideline knowledge integration. The AI methods used for guideline content classification and extraction were pattern-based algorithm and machine learning. In guideline knowledge representation, guideline knowledge verification, and guideline knowledge integration, computer techniques of knowledge representation were the most used.

Title: Clinical Research Informatics: Contributions from 2022.
Author: ['Tannier X', 'Kalra D']
Journal Title: Yearbook of medical informatics
Publication Date: 2023 Aug
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2022. METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected three best papers. RESULTS: Among the 1,324 papers returned by the search, published in 2022, that were in the scope of the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper describes the process undertaken in Germany, under the national Medical Informatics Initiative, to define a process and to gain multi-decision-maker acceptance of broad consent for the reuse of health data for research whilst remaining compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation. The authors of the second-best paper present a federated architecture for the conduct of clinical trial feasibility queries that utilizes HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and an HL7 standard query representation. The third best paper aligns with the overall theme of this Yearbook, the inclusivity of potential participants in clinical trials, with recommendations to ensure greater equity. The fourth proposes a multi-modal modelling approach for large scale phenotyping from electronic health record information. This year's survey paper has also examined equity, along with data bias, and found that the relevant publications in 2022 have focused almost exclusively on the issue of bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI). CONCLUSIONS: The literature relevant to CRI in 2022 has largely been dominated by publications that seek to maximise the reusability of wide scale and representative electronic health record information for research, either as big data for distributed analysis or as a source of information from which to identify suitable patients accurately and equitably for invitation to participate in clinical trials.

Author: ['Magrabi F', 'Lyell D', 'Coiera E']
Journal Title: Yearbook of medical informatics
Publication Date: 2023 Aug
Abstract: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the nature and use of automation in contemporary clinical information systems by reviewing studies reporting the implementation and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare settings. METHOD: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022. We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy. Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised. RESULTS: AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas. Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations. AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records. There is limited support for One Health goals. Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making. CONCLUSION: AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas. There remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on decision-making, care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods. Support for One Health including integrating data about environmental factors and social determinants needs further exploration.

Author: ['Ji S', 'An F', 'Zhang T', 'Lou M', 'Guo J', 'Liu K', 'Zhu Y', 'Wu J', 'Wu R']
Journal Title: European journal of medicinal chemistry
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: As antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes continue to emerge, the identification of effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics has become a pressing issue. Antimicrobial peptides are favored for their safety, low residue, and low resistance properties, and their unique antimicrobial mechanisms show significant potential in combating antibiotic resistance. However, the high production cost and weak activity of antimicrobial peptides limit their application. Moreover, traditional laboratory methods for identifying and designing new antimicrobial peptides are time-consuming and labor-intensive, hindering their development. Currently, novel technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) are being employed to develop and design new antimicrobial peptide resources, offering new opportunities for the advancement of antimicrobial peptides. This article summarizes the basic characteristics and antimicrobial mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides, as well as their advantages and limitations, and explores the application of AI in antimicrobial peptides prediction amd design. This highlights the crucial role of AI in enhancing the efficiency of antimicrobial peptide research and provides a reference for antimicrobial drug development.

Title: Utility of Artificial Intelligence in Orthopedic Surgery Literature Review: A Comparative Pilot Study.
Author: ['Sanii RY', 'Kasto JK', 'Wines WB', 'Mahylis JM', 'Muh SJ']
Journal Title: Orthopedics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Literature reviews are essential to the scientific process and allow clinician researchers to advance general knowledge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the artificial intelligence (AI) programs Chat-GPT and Perplexity.AI can perform an orthopedic surgery literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five different search topics of varying specificity within orthopedic surgery were chosen for each search arm to investigate. A consolidated list of unique articles for each search topic was recorded for the experimental AI search arms and compared with the results of the control arm of two independent reviewers. Articles in the experimental arms were examined by the two independent reviewers for relevancy and validity. RESULTS: ChatGPT was able to identify a total of 61 unique articles. Four articles were not relevant to the search topic and 51 articles were deemed to be fraudulent, resulting in 6 valid articles. Perplexity.AI was able to identify a total of 43 unique articles. Nineteen were not relevant to the search topic but all articles were able to be verified, resulting in 24 valid articles. The control arm was able to identify 132 articles. Success rates for ChatGPT and Perplexity.AI were 4.6% (6 of 132) and 18.2% (24 of 132), respectively. CONCLUSION: The current iteration of ChatGPT cannot perform a reliable literature review, and Perplexity.AI is only able to perform a limited review of the medical literature. Any utilization of these open AI programs should be done with caution and human quality assurance to promote responsible use and avoid the risk of using fabricated search results.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Cognitive dysfunction is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with a well-established dose-response relationship between TBI severity and likelihood or magnitude of persistent cognitive impairment. However, patterns of cognitive dysfunction in the long-term (eg, 6-month) recovery period are less well known. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction within and across cognitive domains (processing speed, memory, and executive functioning) 6 months after injury in patients with TBI seen at level I trauma centers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective longitudinal cohort study used data from Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) and included patients aged 17 years or older presenting at 18 US level I trauma center emergency departments or inpatient units within 24 hours of head injury, control individuals with orthopedic injury recruited from the same centers, and uninjured friend and family controls. Participants were enrolled between March 2, 2014, and July 27, 2018. Data were analyzed from March 5, 2020, through October 3, 2023. EXPOSURES: Traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-15) or orthopedic injury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance on standard neuropsychological tests, including premorbid cognitive ability (National Institutes of Health Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test), verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [4th edition] Processing Speed Index), and executive functioning (Trail Making Test). RESULTS: The sample included 1057 persons with TBI (mean [SD] age, 39.3 [16.4] years; 705 [67%] male) and 327 controls without TBI (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [15.1] years; 222 [68%] male). Most persons with TBI demonstrated performance within 1.5 SDs or better of the control group (49.3% [95% CI, 39.5%-59.2%] to 67.5% [95% CI, 63.7%-71.2%] showed no evidence of impairment). Similarly, 64.4% (95% CI, 54.5%-73.4%) to 78.8% (95% CI, 75.4%-81.9%) of participants demonstrated no evidence of cognitive decline (defined as performance within 1.5 SDs of estimated premorbid ability). For individuals with evidence of either cognitive impairment or decline, diverse profiles of impairment across memory, speed, and executive functioning domains were observed (ie, the prevalence was >0 in each of the 7 combinations of impairment across these 3 cognitive domains for most TBI subgroups). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients seen at level I trauma centers 6 months after TBI, many patients with TBI demonstrated no cognitive impairment. Impairment was more prevalent in persons with more severe TBI and manifested in variable ways across individuals. The findings may guide future research and treatment recommendations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) could minimize the operator-dependent variation in colonoscopy quality. Computer-aided detection (CADe) has improved adenoma detection rate (ADR) and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a need to assess the impact of CADe in real-world settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science for non-randomized, real-world studies of CADe in colonoscopy. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to examine the effect of CADe on ADR and APC. The study is registered under PROSPERO (CRD42023424037). There was no funding for this study. RESULTS: Twelve of 1,314 studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, ADR was statistically significantly higher with vs. without CADe (36.3% vs. 35.8%, risk ratio [RR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.28). This difference remained significant in subgroup analyses evaluating 6 prospective (37.3% vs 35.2%, RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32) but not 6 retrospective (35.7% vs 36.2%, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92-1.36) studies. Among 6 studies with APC data, APC rate ratio with vs. without CADe was 1.12 (95% CI 0.95-1.33). In 4 studies with GI Genius (Medtronic), there was no difference in ADR with vs. without CADe (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: ADR, but not APC, was slightly higher with vs. without CADe among all available real-world studies. This difference was attributed to the results of prospective but not retrospective studies. The discrepancies between these findings vs. those of RCTs call for future research on the true impact of current AI technology on colonoscopy quality, and the subtleties of human-AI interactions.

Title: Twelve tips to leverage AI for efficient and effective medical question generation: A guide for educators using Chat GPT.
Author: ['Indran IR', 'Paramanathan P', 'Gupta N', 'Mustafa N']
Journal Title: Medical teacher
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Crafting quality assessment questions in medical education is a crucial yet time-consuming, expertise-driven undertaking that calls for innovative solutions. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), present a promising yet underexplored avenue for such innovations. AIMS: This study explores the utility of ChatGPT to generate diverse, high-quality medical questions, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as an illustrative example, to increase educator's productivity and enable self-directed learning for students. DESCRIPTION: Leveraging 12 strategies, we demonstrate how ChatGPT can be effectively used to generate assessment questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy and core knowledge domains while promoting best practices in assessment design. CONCLUSION: Integrating LLM tools like ChatGPT into generating medical assessment questions like MCQs augments but does not replace human expertise. With continual instruction refinement, AI can produce high-standard questions. Yet, the onus of ensuring ultimate quality and accuracy remains with subject matter experts, affirming the irreplaceable value of human involvement in the artificial intelligence-driven education paradigm.
