Abstract: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and challenging cancer associated with asbestos fiber exposure, which offers limited treatment options. Historically, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the primary approach, but recent developments have introduced immunotherapy as a promising alternative for the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, the unique growth patterns and occasionally ambiguous progressive characteristics of MPM make the interpretation of radiological assessments complex. Immunotherapy further complicates matters by introducing unconventional treatment response patterns such as hyperprogression and pseudoprogression. Consequently, there is a growing imperative to integrate the standard RECIST criteria with the mesothelioma-specific mRECIST criteria (version 1.1), as outlined in iRECIST. This comprehensive review is driven by the intent to provide a valuable resource for radiologists and clinicians engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of MPM in the era of immunotherapy. Specifically, the current imaging methods employed for staging and follow-up will be exposed and discussed, with a focus on the technical specificities and the mRECIST 1.1 methodology. Furthermore, we will provide a discussion about major clinical trials related to the use of immunotherapy in MPM patients. Finally, the latest advancements in radiomics, the applications of artificial intelligence in MPM, and their potential impact on clinical practice for prognosis and therapy, are discussed.

Title: Developing an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Nudge Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence: A Human-Centred Design Approach.
Author: ['Sumner J', 'Bundele A', 'Lim HW', 'Phan P', 'Motani M', 'Mukhopadhyay A']
Journal Title: Journal of medical systems
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: To improve medication adherence, we co-developed a digital, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nudge intervention with stakeholders (patients, providers, and technologists). We used a human-centred design approach to incorporate user needs in creating an AI-driven nudge tool. We report the findings of the first stage of a multi-phase project: understanding user needs and ideating solutions. We interviewed healthcare providers (n = 10) and patients (n = 10). Providers also rated example nudge interventions in a survey. Stakeholders felt the intervention could address existing deficits in medication adherence tracking and were optimistic about the solution. Participants identified flexibility of the intervention, including mode of delivery, intervention intensity, and the ability to stratify to user ability and needs, as critical success factors. Reminder nudges and provision of healthcare worker contact were rated highly by all. Conversely, patients perceived incentive-based nudges poorly. Finally, participants suggested that user burden could be minimised by leveraging existing software (rather than creating a new App) and simplifying or automating the data entry requirements where feasible. Stakeholder interviews generated in-depth data on the perspectives and requirements for the proposed solution. The participatory approach will enable us to incorporate user needs into the design and improve the utility of the intervention. Our findings show that an AI-driven nudge tool is an acceptable and appropriate solution, assuming it is flexible to user requirements.

Title: Sexual Satisfaction among Lebanese Adults: Scale Validation in Arabic and Correlates Following Two Cross-Sectional Studies.
Author: ['Abboud C', 'Fawaz M', 'Hallit R', 'Obeid S', 'Malaeb D', 'Hallit S']
Journal Title: Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: (1) Background: Sexual satisfaction (SS) is an essential component of quality of life. There is a scarcity of research about sexual satisfaction in Lebanon, a country where discussing sexual issues is still considered a taboo. The present study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of responses to the items in the Arabic version of the Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ), as well as the correlates of sexual satisfaction, among a sample of Lebanese adults. (2) Methods: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted between June and September 2022 with 270 and 359 participants, respectively. (3) Results: The results showed that the Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire is adequate to be used in Lebanon (McDonald's omega = 0.90 and 0.86, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that higher waterpipe dependence (Beta = -0.17) was substantially linked to lower sexual satisfaction, while better emotional intelligence (EI) (Beta = 0.27) and physical activity (Beta = 0.17) were significantly associated with greater sexual satisfaction. (4) Conclusions: The reliability and validity of the responses to the Arabic version of the Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire were supported by our findings. Also, practical implications for sexual satisfaction enhancement strategies in the Lebanese population might be beneficial since many associated factors are considered to be modifiable.

Title: From Empathy to Resilience: The Mediating Role of Emotional Intelligence.
Author: ['Xing L', 'Deng SW', 'Ho GW']
Journal Title: Psychological reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Research has shown that empathy and emotional intelligence are two predictive factors associated with positive adaptation and resilience in emerging adulthood. However, it has not been well investigated how these two factors interact to link resilience. Based on previous research showing that empathy requires the development of emotional perceptiveness, that resilience is closely related to adaptive processes, and that emotional intelligence mediates the relation between emotional perceptiveness and adaptive processes, the present study hypothesized that emotional intelligence has a potential mediating role in the association between empathy and resilience. Data were collected from 788 college students (429 females and 359 males) at a university in China. Resilience was measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Empathy was measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Emotional Intelligence was measured by the Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS). The results showed that empathy significantly predicted resilience, and emotional intelligence fully mediated the association between empathy and resilience. These findings suggest that the cognitive ability to perceive, evaluate, and regulate emotions plays an important role in the resilience in emerging adults. Implications of cognitive approaches to resilience research in emerging adulthood are discussed.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Imaging and image processing is the fundamental pillar of interventional oncology in which diagnostic, procedure planning, treatment and follow-up are sustained. Knowing all the possibilities that the different image modalities can offer is capital to select the most appropriate and accurate guidance for interventional procedures. Despite there is a wide variability in physicians preferences and availability of the different image modalities to guide interventional procedures, it is important to recognize the advantages and limitations for each of them. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the most frequently used image guidance modalities for interventional procedures and its typical and future applications including angiography, computed tomography (CT) and spectral CT, magnetic resonance imaging, Ultrasound and the use of hybrid systems. Finally, we resume the possible role of artificial intelligence related to image in patient selection, treatment and follow-up.

Title: Maximizing Triboelectric Nanogenerators by Physics-Informed AI Inverse Design.
Author: ['Jiao P', 'Wang ZL', 'Alavi AH']
Journal Title: Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought-after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real-life applications. Artificial intelligence-enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance-oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics-informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators. Strategic inverse design is particularly discussed in the contexts of expanding the four-mode analytical models by physics-informed artificial intelligence, discovering new conductive and dielectric materials, and optimizing contact interfaces. Various potential development levels of artificial intelligence-enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators are delineated. Finally, the potential of physics-informed artificial intelligence inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators from prototypes to multifunctional intelligent systems for real-life applications is discussed.

Journal Title: Australian endodontic journal : the journal of the Australian Society of Endodontology Inc
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence system to detect separated endodontic instruments on periapical radiograph radiographs. Three hundred seven periapical radiographs were collected and divided into 222 for training and 85 for testing to be fed to the Mask R-CNN model. Periapical radiographs were assigned to the training and test set and labelled on the DentiAssist labeling platform. Labelled polygonal objects had their bounding boxes automatically generated by the DentiAssist system. Fractured instruments were classified and segmented. As a result of the proposed method, the mean average precision (mAP) metric was 98.809%, the precision value was 95.238, while the recall reached 98.765 and the f1 score 96.969%. The threshold value of 80% was chosen for the bounding boxes working with the Intersection over Union (IoU) technique. The Mask R-CNN distinguished separated endodontic instruments on periapical radiographs.

Title: Data science in drug discovery safety: Challenges and opportunities.
Author: ['Coltman NJ', 'Roberts RA', 'Sidaway JE']
Journal Title: Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Early de-risking of drug targets and chemistry is essential to provide drug projects with the best chance of success. Target safety assessments (TSAs) use target biology, gene and protein expression data, genetic information from humans and animals, and competitor compound intelligence to understand the potential safety risks associated with modulating a drug target. However, there is a vast amount of information, updated daily that must be considered for each TSA. We have developed a data science-based approach that allows acquisition of relevant evidence for an optimal TSA. This is built on expert-led conventional and artificial intelligence-based mining of literature and other bioinformatics databases. Potential safety risks are identified according to an evidence framework, adjusted to the degree of target novelty. Expert knowledge is necessary to interpret the evidence and to take account of the nuances of drug safety, the modality, and the intended patient population for each TSA within each project. Overall, TSAs take full advantage of the most recent developments in data science and can be used within drug projects to identify and mitigate risks, helping with informed decision-making and resource management. These approaches should be used in the earliest stages of a drug project to guide decisions such as target selection, discovery chemistry options, in vitro assay choice, and end points for investigative in vivo studies.

Title: A brief history of artificial intelligence embryo selection: from black-box to glass-box.
Author: ['Lee T', 'Natalwala J', 'Chapple V', 'Liu Y']
Journal Title: Human reproduction (Oxford, England)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: With the exponential growth of computing power and accumulation of embryo image data in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to be utilized in embryo selection in IVF. Amongst different AI technologies, machine learning (ML) has the potential to reduce operator-related subjectivity in embryo selection while saving labor time on this task. However, as modern deep learning (DL) techniques, a subcategory of ML, are increasingly used, its integrated black-box attracts growing concern owing to the well-recognized issues regarding lack of interpretability. Currently, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials to confirm the effectiveness of such black-box models. Recently, emerging evidence has shown underperformance of black-box models compared to the more interpretable traditional ML models in embryo selection. Meanwhile, glass-box AI, such as interpretable ML, is being increasingly promoted across a wide range of fields and is supported by its ethical advantages and technical feasibility. In this review, we propose a novel classification system for traditional and AI-driven systems from an embryology standpoint, defining different morphology-based selection approaches with an emphasis on subjectivity, explainability, and interpretability.

Publication Date: 2023 Sep
Abstract: PURPOSE: The explosion of big data and artificial intelligence has rapidly increased the need for integrated, homogenized, and harmonized health data. Many common data models (CDMs) and standard vocabularies have appeared in an attempt to offer harmonized access to the available information, with Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM being one of the most prominent ones, allowing the standardization and harmonization of health care information. However, despite its flexibility, still capturing imaging metadata along with the corresponding clinical data continues to pose a challenge. This challenge arises from the absence of a comprehensive standard representation for image-related information and subsequent image curation processes and their interlinkage with the respective clinical information. Successful resolution of this challenge holds the potential to enable imaging and clinical data to become harmonized, quality-checked, annotated, and ready to be used in conjunction, in the development of artificial intelligence models and other data-dependent use cases. METHODS: To address this challenge, we introduce medical imaging (MI)-CDM-an extension of the OMOP-CDM specifically designed for registering medical imaging data and curation-related processes. Our modeling choices were the result of iterative numerous discussions among clinical and AI experts to enable the integration of imaging and clinical data in the context of the ProCAncer-I project, for answering a set of clinical questions across the prostate cancer's continuum. RESULTS: Our MI-CDM extension has been successfully implemented for the use case of prostate cancer for integrating imaging and curation metadata along with clinical information by using the OMOP-CDM and its oncology extension. CONCLUSION: By using our proposed terminologies and standardized attributes, we demonstrate how diverse imaging modalities can be seamlessly integrated in the future.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) may affect cognitive function, but studies are limited and inconsistent. The effect of AD severity on cognition remains underexplored and few previous studies have examined clinically validated or repeated measures of cognition throughout childhood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of AD activity and severity with validated measures of general cognition in a longitudinal birth cohort. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a U.K. cohort of 14,975 individuals followed prospectively since their birth in 1991-1992. AD was assessed 11 times between 6 and 166 months old. Mothers were asked if their child had an "itchy, dry skin rash in the joints and creases," and AD status was accordingly time-updated as never, maybe, inactive, active/mild, or active/moderate-severe. General cognition (i.e., IQ) was measured at 18, 49, 103, and 186 months old using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales (GMDS), Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), respectively. Multivariable linear regression was used to compare IQ with respect to nearest time-updated AD status. Secondary analyses were stratified by the presence or absence of psychiatric or learning disorders. An exploratory longitudinal analysis of IQ across all four outcome assessments was conducted using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: No significant associations between AD status and full-scale IQ scores on the GMDS, WPPSI, WISC, and WASI were observed after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, atopic comorbidities, and sleep characteristics. However, at 8 years old, WISC Performance IQ was slightly though statistically significantly lower among children with active/moderate-severe AD (beta-coefficient -2.16 [95% CI -4.12, -0.19]) and Verbal IQ was slightly but statistically significantly higher among those with inactive AD (beta 1.31 [0.28, 2.34]) compared to those without AD. Analyses stratified by psychiatric or learning disorders, and exploratory longitudinal analyses of cognition revealed similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any clinically meaningful associations between AD activity and severity and general cognitive function during early childhood and adolescence. Future studies should incorporate objective measures of AD severity and investigate outcomes beyond IQ.

Abstract: Flexible pressure sensors based on micro-/nanostructures can be integrated into robots to achieve sensitive tactile perception. However, conventional symmetric structures, such as pyramids or hemispheres, can sense only the magnitude of a force and not its direction. In this study, a capacitive flexible tactile sensor inspired by skin structures and based on an asymmetric microhair structure array to perceive directional shear force is designed. Asymmetric microhair structures are obtained by two-photon polymerization (TPP) and replication. Owing to the features of asymmetric microhair structures, different shear force directions result in different deformations. The designed device can determine the directions of both static and dynamic shear forces. Additionally, it exhibits large response scales ranging from 30 Pa to 300 kPa and maintains high stability even after 5000 cycles; the final relative capacitive change (DeltaC/C(0) ) is <2.5%. This flexible tactile sensor has the potential to improve the perception and manipulation ability of dexterous hands and enhance the intelligence of robots.

Journal Title: Annals of medicine
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Human error estimating food intake is a major source of bias in nutrition research. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods may reduce bias, but the overall accuracy of AI estimates is unknown. This study was a systematic review of peer-reviewed journal articles comparing fully automated AI-based (e.g. deep learning) methods of dietary assessment from digital images to human assessors and ground truth (e.g. doubly labelled water). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature was searched through May 2023 in four electronic databases plus reference mining. Eligible articles reported AI estimated volume, energy, or nutrients. Independent investigators screened articles and extracted data. Potential sources of bias were documented in absence of an applicable risk of bias assessment tool. RESULTS: Database and hand searches identified 14,059 unique publications; fifty-two papers (studies) published from 2010 to 2023 were retained. For food detection and classification, 79% of papers used a convolutional neural network. Common ground truth sources were calculation using nutrient tables (51%) and weighed food (27%). Included papers varied widely in food image databases and results reported, so meta-analytic synthesis could not be conducted. Relative errors were extracted or calculated from 69% of papers. Average overall relative errors (AI vs. ground truth) ranged from 0.10% to 38.3% for calories and 0.09% to 33% for volume, suggesting similar performance. Ranges of relative error were lower when images had single/simple foods. CONCLUSIONS: Relative errors for volume and calorie estimations suggest that AI methods align with - and have the potential to exceed - accuracy of human estimations. However, variability in food image databases and results reported prevented meta-analytic synthesis. The field can advance by testing AI architectures on a limited number of large-scale food image and nutrition databases that the field determines to be adequate for training and testing and by reporting accuracy of at least absolute and relative error for volume or calorie estimations.

Author: ['Wang L', 'Li W', 'Wan L', 'Wen D']
Journal Title: ACS sensors
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: Artificial olfactory systems are receiving increasing attention because of their potential applications in humanoid robots, artificial noses, and the next generation of human-computer interactions. However, simulating the human olfactory system, which recognizes, remembers, and automatically takes protective measures against gases, remains a challenge. In this paper, a WO(3)-TiO(2)@Ag NPs (silver nanoparticle) gas sensor was prepared by the sol-gel method, and an Al/pectin:AgNP/ITO memristor was prepared by spin coating and vacuum evaporation. The gas sensor has been combined with the memristor to simulate physical damage to humans in a dangerous gas environment for a long time, and an artificial olfactory system is constructed by field-programmable gate array external control. The WO(3)-TiO(2)@Ag NPs gas sensor can sense and identify ethanol vapor through changes in resistance, and the signal transmitted to the pectin-based memristor can switch the resistance state of the memristor to store gas information. Furthermore, the activation of the memristor can also trigger rotation of the fan to purify the gas and reduce damage caused by excessive exposure to dangerous gases. This artificial olfactory system provides a promising strategy for the development of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction systems.

Title: Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict the Development of Kyphosis Disease: A Systematic Review.
Author: ['Hussein YY', 'Khan MM']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence in the field of medicine - including spine surgery - is now widespread and prominent. Kyphosis is a prevalent disease in spine surgery with abundant morbidity. Predicting the development of kyphosis disease has been somewhat difficult, and the use of AI to aid in the prediction of kyphosis disease may yield new opportunities for spine surgeons. The aim of this review is to recognize the contributions of AI in predicting the development of kyphosis. Five databases/registers were searched to identify suitable records for this review. Nine studies were included in this review. The studies demonstrated that AI could be utilized to predict the development of kyphosis disease after corrective surgery for a variety of spinal pathologies, including thoracolumbar burst fracture, cervical deformity, previous kyphosis disease, and adult degenerative scoliosis. The studies utilized a variety of AI modalities, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and artificial neural networks. Two of the included studies also compared the use of different AI modalities in predicting the development of kyphosis disease. The literature has demonstrated that AI can be utilized effectively to predict the development of kyphosis disease. However, the current research is limited and only sparsely covers this broad field. Therefore, we suggest that further research is needed to explore the uncharted opportunities in predicting the development of kyphosis disease. Also, further research would confirm and consolidate the benefits demonstrated by the literature included in this review.

Title: How do project managers' competencies impact project success? A systematic literature review.
Author: ['Ochoa Pacheco P', 'Coello-Montecel D', 'Tello M', 'Lasio V', 'Armijos A']
Journal Title: PloS one
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Despite the existence of systematic literature reviews focused on examining the factors contributing to project success, there remains a scarcity of reviews addressing the relationship between the project managers' competencies and project success. To fill this gap in the literature, this review aimed to evaluate peer-reviewed articles, published between 2010 and 2022, and analyze the impact of project managers' competencies on project success. The Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest electronic databases were first consulted in September 2021, with an update in August and October 2022. A total of 232 titles were analyzed. Ten articles met the criteria and were fully reviewed. A content analysis and a citation network were carried out to analyze the included articles. The analysis revealed that the existing literature has primarily explored the influence of competencies from the personal and social dimensions, such as leadership, communication, and emotional intelligence, on project success. Conversely, competencies from other dimensions have received less attention in the literature. In addition, this review contributes to the literature by providing a holistic categorization of competencies associated with project success and examining and organizing project success criteria into three dimensions.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chest X-ray (CXR) screening for tuberculosis (TB) is becoming increasingly popular. Still, deploying such AI tools can be challenging due to multiple real-life barriers like software installation, workflow integration, network connectivity constraints, limited human resources available to interpret findings, etc. To understand these challenges, PATH implemented a TB REACH active case-finding program in a resource-limited setting of Nagpur in India, where an AI software device (qXR) intended for TB screening using CXR images was used. Eight private CXR laboratories that fulfilled prerequisites for AI software installation were engaged for this program. Key lessons about operational feasibility and accessibility, along with the strategies adopted to overcome these challenges, were learned during this program. This program also helped to screen 10,481 presumptive TB individuals using informal providers based on clinical history. Among them, 2,303 individuals were flagged as presumptive for TB by a radiologist or by AI based on their CXR interpretation. Approximately 15.8% increase in overall TB yield could be attributed to the presence of AI alone because these additional cases were not deemed presumptive for TB by radiologists, but AI was able to identify them. Successful implementation of AI tools like qXR in resource-limited settings in India will require solving real-life implementation challenges for seamless deployment and workflow integration.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the mental health care environment. AI tools are increasingly accessed by clients and service users. Mental health professionals must be prepared not only to use AI but also to have conversations about it when delivering care. Despite the potential for AI to enable more efficient and reliable and higher-quality care delivery, there is a persistent gap among mental health professionals in the adoption of AI. OBJECTIVE: A needs assessment was conducted among mental health professionals to (1) understand the learning needs of the workforce and their attitudes toward AI and (2) inform the development of AI education curricula and knowledge translation products. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive approach was taken to explore the needs of mental health professionals regarding their adoption of AI through semistructured interviews. To reach maximum variation sampling, mental health professionals (eg, psychiatrists, mental health nurses, educators, scientists, and social workers) in various settings across Ontario (eg, urban and rural, public and private sector, and clinical and research) were recruited. RESULTS: A total of 20 individuals were recruited. Participants included practitioners (9/20, 45% social workers and 1/20, 5% mental health nurses), educator scientists (5/20, 25% with dual roles as professors/lecturers and researchers), and practitioner scientists (3/20, 15% with dual roles as researchers and psychiatrists and 2/20, 10% with dual roles as researchers and mental health nurses). Four major themes emerged: (1) fostering practice change and building self-efficacy to integrate AI into patient care; (2) promoting system-level change to accelerate the adoption of AI in mental health; (3) addressing the importance of organizational readiness as a catalyst for AI adoption; and (4) ensuring that mental health professionals have the education, knowledge, and skills to harness AI in optimizing patient care. CONCLUSIONS: AI technologies are starting to emerge in mental health care. Although many digital tools, web-based services, and mobile apps are designed using AI algorithms, mental health professionals have generally been slower in the adoption of AI. As indicated by this study's findings, the implications are 3-fold. At the individual level, digital professionals must see the value in digitally compassionate tools that retain a humanistic approach to care.
