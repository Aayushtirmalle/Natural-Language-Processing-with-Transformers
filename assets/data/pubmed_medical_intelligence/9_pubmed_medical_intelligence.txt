Abstract: Radioactive particle tracking is a nuclear technique that tracks a sealed radioactive particle inside a volume through a mathematical location algorithm, which is widely applied in many fields such as chemical and civil engineering in hydrodynamics flows. It is possible to reconstruct the trajectory of the radioactive particle using a traditional mathematical algorithm or artificial intelligence methods. In this paper, the traditional algorithm is based on solving a minimization problem between the simulated events and a calibration dataset, and it was written using C++ language. The artificial intelligence method is represented by a deep neural network, in which hyperparameters were defined using a Python optimization library called Optuna. This paper aims to compare the potentiality of both methods to evaluate the accuracy of the radioactive particle tracking technique. This study proposes a simplified model of a concrete mixer, six NaI(Tl) detectors, and a(137)Cs sealed radioactive particle. The simulated measurement geometry and the dataset (3615 patterns) were developed using the MCNPX code, which is a mathematical code based on the Monte Carlo Method. The results show a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 20.81%, 10.33%, and 16.84% for x, y and z coordinates, respectively, for the traditional algorithm. For the deep neural network, MAPE is 6.87%, 2.70%, and 22.79% respectively for x, y and z coordinates. In addition, an investigation is carried out to analyze whether the size of the calibration dataset influences the performance of both methods.

Author: ['Castonguay A', 'Wagner G', 'Motulsky A', 'Pare G']
Journal Title: Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 8
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in health care are on the agenda of policymakers around the world, but a major challenge remains, namely, to set policies that will ensure wide acceptance and capture the value of AI while mitigating associated risks. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of how OECD countries strategize about how to integrate AI into health care and to determine their actual level of AI maturity. METHODS: A scan of government-based AI strategies and initiatives adopted in 10 proactive OECD countries was conducted. Available documentation was analyzed, using the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development's roadmap to AI maturity as a conceptual framework. RESULTS: The findings reveal that most selected OECD countries are at the Emerging stage (Level 2) of AI in health maturity. Despite considerable funding and a variety of approaches to the development of an AI in health supporting ecosystem, only the United Kingdom and United States have reached the highest level of maturity, an integrated and collaborative AI in health ecosystem (Level 3). CONCLUSION: Despite policymakers looking for opportunities to expedite efforts related to AI, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure the sustainable development and safe use of AI in health. The principles of equifinality and mindfulness must thus guide policymaking in the development of AI in health care.

Title: Intensive vision-guided network for radiology report generation.

Journal Title: Physics in medicine and biology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is booming due to its huge application potential for the healthcare industry. However, existing computer vision and natural language processing approaches to tackle this problem are limited in two aspects. First, when extracting image features, most of them neglect multi-view reasoning in vision and model single-view structure of medical images, such as space-view or channel-view. However, clinicians rely on multi-view imaging information for comprehensive judgment in daily clinical diagnosis. Second, when generating reports, they overlook context reasoning with multi-modal information and focus on pure textual optimization utilizing retrieval-based methods. We aim to address these two issues by proposing a model that better simulates clinicians' perspectives and generates more accurate reports. &#xD;Approach. Given the above limitation in feature extraction, we propose a Globally-intensive Attention (GIA) module in the medical image encoder to simulate and integrate multi-view vision perception. GIA aims to learn three types of vision perception: depth view, space view, and pixel view. On the other hand, to address the above problem in report generation, we explore how to involve multi-modal signals to generate precisely matched reports, i.e., how to integrate previously predicted words with region-aware visual content in next word prediction. Specifically, we design a Visual Knowledge-guided Decoder (VKGD), which can adaptively consider how much the model needs to rely on visual information and previously predicted text to assist next word prediction. Hence, our final Intensive Vision-guided Network (IVGN) framework includes a GIA-guided Visual Encoder and the VKGD. &#xD;Main results. Experiments on two commonly-used datasets IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate the superior ability of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. &#xD;Significance. Our model explores the potential of simulating clinicians' perspectives and automatically generates more accurate reports, which promotes the exploration of medical automation and intelligence.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Several studies have described disparities between male and female patients following spine surgery, but no pooled analyses have performed a robust review characterizing differences in postoperative outcomes based on gender. The purpose of this study was to broadly assess the effects of gender on postoperative outcomes following elective spine surgery. METHODS: Between November 2022 and March 2023, PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Embase were queried using artificial intelligence-assisted software for relevant cohort studies. Cohort studies with a minimum sample of 100 patients conducted in the United States since 2010 were eligible. Studies related to trauma, tumors, infections, and spinal cord pathology were excluded. Independent extraction by multiple reviewers was performed using Nested Knowledge software. A fixed- or random-effects model was used if heterogeneity among included studies in a meta-analysis was < 50% or >/= 50%, respectively. Risk of bias was assessed independently by multiple reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled effect sizes were calculated for readmission, nonroutine discharge (NRD), length of stay (LOS), extended LOS, reoperation, mortality, all medical complications (individual analyses for cardiovascular, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, genitourinary, neurological, respiratory, and systemic infection complications), and wound-related complications. For each outcome, two subanalyses were performed with studies that used either center-based (single- or multi-institution) or high-volume (national or state-wide) databases. RESULTS: Across 124 included studies, male patients had an increased incidence of mortality (OR 0.54, p < 0.0001) and all medical complications (OR 0.80, p = 0.0114), specifically cardiovascular (OR 0.68, p < 0.0001) and respiratory (OR 0.76, p = 0.0008) complications. Female patients were more likely to experience a wound-related surgical complication (OR 1.16, p = 0.0183). These findings persisted in the high-volume database subanalyses. Only center-based subanalyses showed that female patients were at greater odds of experiencing an NRD (OR 1.18, p = 0.0476), longer LOS (SMD 0.23, p = 0.0036), and extended LOS (OR 1.28, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Males are more likely to experience death and medical complications, whereas females were more likely to face wound-related surgical complications. At the institution level, females more often experience NRD and longer hospital stays. These findings may better inform preoperative expectation management and provide more detailed postoperative risk assessments based on the patient's gender.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood sugar control issues. The state-of-the-art solution is the artificial pancreas (AP), which integrates basal insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. However, APs are unable to manage postprandial glucose response (PGR) due to limited knowledge of its determinants, requiring additional information for accurate bolus delivery, such as estimated carbohydrate intake. This study aims to quantify the influence of various meal-related factors on predicting postprandial blood glucose levels (BGLs) at different time intervals (15 min, 60 min, and 120 min) after meals by using deep neural network (DNN) models. The prediction models incorporate preprandial blood glucose values, insulin dosage, and various meal-related nutritional factors such as intake of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fatty acids, fibers, glycemic index, and glycemic load as input variables. The impact of input features was assessed by exploiting eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provide insights into each feature's contribution to the model predictions. By leveraging XAI methodologies, this study aims to enhance the interpretability and transparency of BGL prediction models and validate clinical literature hypotheses. The findings can aid in the development of decision-support tools for individuals with T1DM, facilitating PGR management and reducing the risks of adverse events. The improved understanding of PGR determinants may lead to advancements in AP technology and improve the overall quality of life for T1DM patients.

Abstract: Medical imaging is a key component in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical trial design, accounting for almost 90% of all healthcare data. CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on small-scale MI data. Despite their important advances, typical CNN have relatively limited capabilities in modelling "global" pixel interactions, which restricts their generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different "global" information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments ("Transf/Attention") which can well maintain properties for modelling global relationships, have been proposed as lighter alternatives of full Transformers. Recently, there is an increasing trend to co-pollinate complementary local-global properties from CNN and Transf/Attention architectures, which led to a new era of hybrid models. The past years have witnessed substantial growth in hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models across diverse MIA problems. In this systematic review, we survey existing hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, review and unravel key architectural designs, analyse breakthroughs, and evaluate current and future opportunities as well as challenges. We also introduced an analysis framework on generalisation opportunities of scientific and clinical impact, based on which new data-driven domain generalisation and adaptation methods can be stimulated.

Author: ['Huang TJ', 'Chang PH', 'Chiou HS', 'Hsu HJ']
Journal Title: American journal of speech-language pathology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the cognitive functions of Mandarin speakers with poststroke aphasia and to investigate the relationship between nonlinguistic cognitive deficits and the severity of aphasia. METHOD: Twenty-three adults with aphasia resulting from left-hemispheric stroke and 23 adults matched for age and educational level completed a series of six nonlinguistic cognitive tests measuring nonverbal intelligence, short-term memory, visual selective attention, visual alternating attention, auditory selective attention, and auditory alternating attention. A standardized aphasia assessment (Concise Chinese Aphasia Test [CCAT]) was also conducted to evaluate the severity of aphasia. Data analyses examined cognitive functions by comparing task performance of the two groups and examining the relationship between scores on the cognitive tasks and aphasia severity based on a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: The aphasia group scored significantly lower than the control group on all nonlinguistic cognitive tasks with large effect sizes (d = 0.95 ~ 1.54). Significant associations between different nonlinguistic cognitive tasks and CCAT subtests were observed. Results from the hierarchical regression analysis showed that auditory alternating attention was the only factor that significantly predicted aphasia severity based on CCAT overall scores after age and education level were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The findings align with prior research observing deficits in nonlinguistic cognition in individuals with aphasia. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

Title: Text Dialogue Analysis for Primary Screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment: Development and Validation Study.
Author: ['Wang C', 'Liu S', 'Li A', 'Liu J']
Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence models tailored to diagnose cognitive impairment have shown excellent results. However, it is unclear whether large linguistic models can rival specialized models by text alone. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored the performance of ChatGPT for primary screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and standardized the design steps and components of the prompts. METHODS: We gathered a total of 174 participants from the DementiaBank screening and classified 70% of them into the training set and 30% of them into the test set. Only text dialogues were kept. Sentences were cleaned using a macro code, followed by a manual check. The prompt consisted of 5 main parts, including character setting, scoring system setting, indicator setting, output setting, and explanatory information setting. Three dimensions of variables from published studies were included: vocabulary (ie, word frequency and word ratio, phrase frequency and phrase ratio, and lexical complexity), syntax and grammar (ie, syntactic complexity and grammatical components), and semantics (ie, semantic density and semantic coherence). We used R 4.3.0. for the analysis of variables and diagnostic indicators. RESULTS: Three additional indicators related to the severity of MCI were incorporated into the final prompt for the model. These indicators were effective in discriminating between MCI and cognitively normal participants: tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (P<.001), difficulty with complex ideas (P<.001), and memory issues (P<.001). The final GPT-4 model achieved a sensitivity of 0.8636, a specificity of 0.9487, and an area under the curve of 0.9062 on the training set; on the test set, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve reached 0.7727, 0.8333, and 0.8030, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT was effective in the primary screening of participants with possible MCI. Improved standardization of prompts by clinicians would also improve the performance of the model. It is important to note that ChatGPT is not a substitute for a clinician making a diagnosis.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily a disease diagnosed in young and middle-aged adults. Although MS is a rare condition in pediatric age, an increasing rate of patients is diagnosed under the age of 18. The disabling nature of the disease cannot be reduced only to physical symptoms. Several additional symptoms such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, and psychological symptoms are common features of pediatric MS. The reviewed literature suggests that, despite the lower physical disability, children and adolescents diagnosed with MS are vulnerable to cognitive impairment even in the early stage of the disease. The neuropsychological profile of pediatric MS may resemble that of adult MS, including an impairment in attention/information processing speed, learning, verbal, and visuospatial memory. However, cognitive difficulties in children and adolescents are more likely to involve also general intelligence and linguistic abilities, presumably due to patients' younger age and cognitive growth stage. Cognitive difficulties, beyond physical disability and relapses, may have a considerable impact on learning and school achievement. Depression and fatigue are other highly prevalent disturbances in pediatric MS and may contribute to patients' low functional outcomes. Overall, these manifestations may cause considerable functional impairment on daily activities and quality of life that may require individualized rehabilitative treatment and extensive psychosocial care. Additional neuropsychological research evaluating larger samples, using more homogenous methods, and exploring the role of MS treatment on cognitive and psychological development is required.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Utilization of electronic health records data to derive predictive indexes such as the electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score can have significant utility in health care delivery. Within the records, CT scans contain phenotypic data which have significant prognostic value. However, data extractions have not traditionally been applied to imaging data. In this study, we utilized artificial intelligence to automate biomarker extraction from CT scans and examined the value of these features in improving risk prediction in patients with liver disease. APPROACH: Using a regional liver disease cohort from the Veterans Health System, we retrieved administrative, laboratory and clinical data for Veterans who had CT scans performed for any clinical indication between 2008 to 2014. Imaging biomarkers were automatically derived using the analytic morphomics platform. RESULTS: 4614 patients were included. We found that the electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score had a Concordance-index of 0.64 for the prediction of overall mortality while the imaging based model alone or with electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score performed significantly better, Concordance-index of 0.72 and 0.73 (p<0.001). For the subset of patients without hepatic decompensation at baseline (n=4452), the Concordance-index for predicting future decompensation was 0.67, 0.79 and 0.80 for electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score , imaging alone or combined respectively. CONCLUSION: This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of utilizing automated extraction of imaging features within CT scans either alone or in conjunction with classic health data can improve risk prediction in patients with chronic liver disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Early detection of melanoma requires timely access to medical care. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to flag possible melanomas in self-referred patients concerned that a skin lesion might be cancerous. METHODS: Patients were recruited for the study through advertisements in 2 hospitals in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Lesions of concern were initially examined by a trained medical student and if the study criteria were met, the lesions were then scanned using the FotoFinder System((R)). The images were analyzed using their proprietary computer software. Macroscopic and dermoscopic images were evaluated by 3 experienced dermatologists and a senior dermatology resident, all blinded to the AI results. Suspicious lesions identified by the AI or any of the 3 dermatologists were then excised. RESULTS: Seventeen confirmed malignancies were found, including 10 melanomas. Six melanomas were not flagged by the AI. These lesions showed ambiguous atypical melanocytic proliferations, and all were diagnostically challenging to the dermatologists and to the dermatopathologists. Eight malignancies were seen in patients with a family history of melanoma. The AI's ability to diagnose malignancy is not inferior to the dermatologists examining dermoscopic images. CONCLUSION: AI, used in this study, may serve as a practical skin cancer screening aid. While it does have technical and diagnostic limitations, its inclusion in a melanoma screening program, directed at those with a concern about a particular lesion would be valuable in providing timely access to the diagnosis of skin cancer.

Title: Toward hippocampal volume measures on ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging: a comprehensive comparison study between deep learning and conventional approaches.
Author: ['Lyu J', 'Bartlett PF', 'Nasrallah FA', 'Tang X']
Journal Title: Frontiers in neuroscience
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The hippocampus is a complex brain structure that plays an important role in various cognitive aspects such as memory, intelligence, executive function, and path integration. The volume of this highly plastic structure is identified as one of the most important biomarkers of specific neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been extensively investigated in numerous aging studies. However, recent studies on aging show that the performance of conventional approaches in measuring the hippocampal volume is still far from satisfactory, especially in terms of delivering longitudinal measures from ultra-high field magnetic resonance images (MRIs), which can visualize more boundary details. The advancement of deep learning provides an alternative solution to measuring the hippocampal volume. In this work, we comprehensively compared a deep learning pipeline based on nnU-Net with several conventional approaches including Freesurfer, FSL and DARTEL, for automatically delivering hippocampal volumes: (1) Firstly, we evaluated the segmentation accuracy and precision on a public dataset through cross-validation. Results showed that the deep learning pipeline had the lowest mean (L = 1.5%, R = 1.7%) and the lowest standard deviation (L = 5.2%, R = 6.2%) in terms of volume percentage error. (2) Secondly, sub-millimeter MRIs of a group of healthy adults with test-retest 3T and 7T sessions were used to extensively assess the test-retest reliability. Results showed that the deep learning pipeline achieved very high intraclass correlation coefficients (L = 0.990, R = 0.986 for 7T; L = 0.985, R = 0.983 for 3T) and very small volume percentage differences (L = 1.2%, R = 0.9% for 7T; L = 1.3%, R = 1.3% for 3T). (3) Thirdly, a Bayesian linear mixed effect model was constructed with respect to the hippocampal volumes of two healthy adult datasets with longitudinal 7T scans and one disease-related longitudinal dataset. It was found that the deep learning pipeline detected both the subtle and disease-related changes over time with high sensitivity as well as the mild differences across subjects. Comparison results from the aforementioned three aspects showed that the deep learning pipeline significantly outperformed the conventional approaches by large margins. Results also showed that the deep learning pipeline can better accommodate longitudinal analysis purposes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in the medical domain in recent years. AI, an expansive field comprising Machine Learning (ML) and, within it, Deep Learning (DL), seeks to emulate the intricate operations of the human brain. It examines vast amounts of data and plays a crucial role in decision-making, overcoming limitations related to human evaluation. DL utilizes complex algorithms to analyze data. ML and DL are subsets of AI that utilize hard statistical techniques that help machines consistently improve at tasks with experience. Pancreatic cancer is more common in developed countries and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Managing pancreatic cancer remains a challenge despite significant advancements in diagnosis and treatment. AI has secured an almost ubiquitous presence in the field of oncological workup and management, especially in gastroenterology malignancies. AI is particularly useful for various investigations of pancreatic carcinoma because it has specific radiological features that enable diagnostic procedures without the requirement of a histological study. However, interpreting and evaluating resulting images is not always simple since images vary as the disease progresses. Secondly, a number of factors may impact prognosis and response to the treatment process. Currently, AI models have been created for diagnosing, grading, staging, and predicting prognosis and treatment response. This review presents the most up-to-date knowledge on the use of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.

Abstract: STUDY PURPOSE: This study aims to analyze various influencing factors among generations X (Gen X), Y (Gen Y), and Z (Gen Z) of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mental health virtual assistants. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted in this study. The study sample consisted of outpatients diagnosed with various mental health illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. A survey questionnaire was designed based on the factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and behavioural intention) identified from the unified theory of acceptance and use of the technology model. Ethical approval was received from the Ethics Committee at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients participated in the study, with over 80% having moderate to high experience in using mental health AI assistants. The ANOVA results for performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), and behavioral intentions (BI) indicate that there are statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the Gen X, Gen Y, and Gen Z participants. CONCLUSION: The findings underscore the significance of considering generational differences in attitudes and perceptions, with Gen Y and Gen Z demonstrating more positive attitudes and stronger intentions to use AI mental health virtual assistants, while Gen X appears to be more cautious.

Title: Artificial Intelligence: A Reliable Tool to Detect the Elongation of the Styloid Process.
Author: ['Jeevitha S J', 'Kumar S L', 'Yadalam PK']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Background Eagle's syndrome is characterized by the anomalous elongation of the styloid process. This condition is usually identified through the manual evaluation of orthopantomogram (OPG) images, which is time-consuming and can have interobserver variability. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is gaining importance and interest in recent years. The application of AI in detecting styloid process elongation is less explored, advocating for research in the same arena. Aim and objectives The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence in detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs and to compare the performance of the three different AI algorithms with that of the manual radiographic evaluation by the radiologist. Materials and methods A total of 400 digital OPGs were screened, and linear measurements of the styloid process length (ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Maryland, USA)) were done for the identification of styloid process elongation by a single calibrated observer to finally include a processed image dataset including 169 images of the elongated styloid process and 200 images of the normal styloid process. A machine learning approach was used to detect the styloid process elongation using the three different AI models: logistic regression, neural network, and Naive Bayes algorithms in Orange software (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). Performance evaluation was done using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve. Results Logistic regression and neural network algorithms depicted the highest accuracy of 100% with no false positives or false negatives, securing a score of 1.000 for all the metrics. However, the Naive Bayes model demonstrated a fairly considerable accuracy, classifying 49 false positive images and 59 false negative images with an AUC (area under the curve) score of 78 %. Nevertheless, it performed better than random guessing. Conclusion Logistic regression and neural network algorithms accurately detected styloid process elongation similar to that of manual radiographic evaluation. The Naive Bayes algorithm did not perform an accurate classification yet performed better than random guessing. AI holds a promising scope for its application in automatically detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is important to diagnose cerebral infarction at an early stage and select an appropriate treatment method. The number of stroke-trained physicians is unevenly distributed; thus, a shortage of specialists is a major problem in some regions. In this retrospective design study, we tested whether an artificial intelligence (AI) we built using computer-aided detection/diagnosis may help medical physicians to classify stroke for the appropriate treatment. METHODS: To build the Stroke Classification and Treatment Support System AI, the clinical data of 231 hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke from January 2016 to December 2017 were used for training the AI. To verify the diagnostic accuracy, 151 patients who were admitted for stroke between January 2018 and December 2018 were also enrolled. RESULTS: By utilizing multimodal data, such as DWI and ADC map images, as well as patient examination data, we were able to construct an AI that can explain the analysis results with a small amount of training data. Furthermore, the AI was able to classify with high accuracy (Cohort 1, evaluation data 88.7%; Cohort 2, validation data 86.1%). CONCLUSION: In recent years, the treatment options for cerebral infarction have increased in number and complexity, making it even more important to provide appropriate treatment according to the initial diagnosis. This system could be used for initial treatment to automatically diagnose and classify strokes in hospitals where stroke-trained physicians are not available and improve the prognosis of cerebral infarction.

Title: Traumatic rib fracture patterns associated with bone mineral density statuses derived from CT images.
Author: ['Tang Y', 'Hong W', 'Xu X', 'Li M', 'Jin L']
Journal Title: Frontiers in endocrinology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The impact of decreased bone mineral density (BMD) on traumatic rib fractures remains unknown. We combined computed tomography (CT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to measure BMD and explore its impact on traumatic rib fractures and their patterns. METHODS: The retrospective cohort comprised patients who visited our hospital from 2017-2018; the prospective cohort (control group) was consecutively recruited from the same hospital from February-June 2023. All patients had blunt chest trauma and underwent CT. Volumetric BMD of L1 vertebra was measured by using an AI software. Analyses were done by using BMD categorized as osteoporosis (<80 mg/cm3), osteopenia (80-120 mg/cm3), or normal (>120 mg/cm3). Pearson's chi2, Fisher's exact, or Kruskal-Wallis tests and Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons. Negative binomial, and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations and impacts of BMD status. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. FINDINGS: The retrospective cohort included 2,076 eligible patients, of whom 954 (46%) had normal BMD, 806 (38.8%) had osteopenia, and 316 (15.2%) had osteoporosis. After sex- and age-adjustment, osteoporosis was significantly associated with higher rib fracture rates, and a higher likelihood of fractures in ribs 4-7. Furthermore, both the osteopenia and osteoporosis groups demonstrated a significantly higher number of fractured ribs and fracture sites on ribs, with a higher likelihood of fractures in ribs 1-3, as well as flail chest. The prospective cohort included 205 eligible patients, of whom 92 (44.9%) had normal BMD, 74 (36.1%) had osteopenia, and 39 (19.0%) had osteoporosis. The findings observed within this cohort were in concurrence with those in the retrospective cohort. INTERPRETATION: Traumatic rib fractures are associated with decreased BMD. CT-AI can help to identify individuals who have decreased BMD and a greater rib fracture rate, along with their fracture patterns.

Abstract: In this study, we elucidate if synthetic contrast enhanced computed tomography images created from plain computed tomography images using deep neural networks could be used for screening, clinical diagnosis, and postoperative follow-up of small-diameter renal tumors. This retrospective, multicenter study included 155 patients (artificial intelligence training cohort [n = 99], validation cohort [n = 56]) who underwent surgery for small-diameter (</=40 mm) renal tumors, with the pathological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, during 2010-2020. We created a learned deep neural networks using pix2pix. We examined the quality of the synthetic enhanced computed tomography images created using this deep neural networks and compared them with real enhanced computed tomography images using the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation parameter. We assessed concordance rates between real and synthetic images and diagnoses according to 10 urologists by creating a receiver operating characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve. The synthetic computed tomography images were highly concordant with the real computed tomography images, regardless of the existence or morphology of the renal tumor. Regarding the concordance rate, a greater area under the curve was obtained with synthetic computed tomography (area under the curve = 0.892) than with only computed tomography (area under the curve = 0.720; p < 0.001). In conclusions, this study is the first to use deep neural networks to create a high-quality synthetic computed tomography image that was highly concordant with a real computed tomography image. Our synthetic computed tomography images could be used for urological diagnoses and clinical screening.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide the ability to effectively evaluate and analyze human skin and hair assessments. The aim of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of applying Machine Learning (ML) methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in order to evaluate hair and skin assessments. PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct were searched in order to retrieve research publications between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2020 using appropriate keywords such as "hair and skin analysis." Following accurate screening, 20 peer-reviewed publications were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. The analysis demonstrated that prevalent Machine Learning (ML) methods comprised of Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest Neighbor, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANN's were observed to yield the highest accuracy of 95% followed by SVM generating 90%. These techniques were most commonly applied for drafting framework assessments such as that of Melanoma. Values of parameters such as Sensitivity, Specificity, and Area under the Curve (AUC) were extracted from the studies and with the help of comparisons, relevant inferences were also made. ANN's were observed to yield the highest sensitivity of 82.30% as well as a 96.90% specificity. Hence, with this systematic review, a summarization of the studies was drafted that encapsulated how Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed for the analysis and evaluation of hair and skin assessments.
