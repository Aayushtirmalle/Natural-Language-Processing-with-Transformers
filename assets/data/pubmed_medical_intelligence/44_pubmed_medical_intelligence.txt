Abstract: Stuttering is a widespread speech disorder affecting people globally, and it impacts effective communication and quality of life. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence have introduced new possibilities for augmenting stuttering detection and treatment procedures. In this systematic review, the latest AI advancements and computational intelligence techniques in the context of stuttering are explored. By examining the existing literature, we investigated the application of AI in accurately determining and classifying stuttering manifestations. Furthermore, we explored how computational intelligence can contribute to developing innovative assessment tools and intervention strategies for persons who stutter (PWS). We reviewed and analyzed 14 refereed journal articles that were indexed on the Web of Science from 2019 onward. The potential of AI and computational intelligence in revolutionizing stuttering assessment and treatment, which can enable personalized and effective approaches, is also highlighted in this review. By elucidating these advancements, we aim to encourage further research and development in this crucial area, enhancing in due course the lives of PWS.

Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe the evaluation of a variety of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound with different software, such as Cristal Vue, Realistic Vue, LumiFlow, and Spatiotemporal Image Correlation (STIC), with HDlive and HDlive Flow Silhouette modes. These technologies provide realistic images of the fetal heart and cardiac vessels using a fixed virtual light source that allows the operator to freely select a better light source position to enhance the cardiovascular anatomical details. In addition, Fetal Intelligent Navigation Echocardiography (FINE) technology, also known as "5D Heart" or "5D", is a technology that enables the automatic reconstruction of the nine standard fetal echocardiographic views and can alert non-specialists to suspected CHD. Through the use of artificial intelligence, an ultrasound machine is able to perform automatic anatomical and functional measurements. In addition, hese technologies enable the reconstruction of fetal cardiac structures in realistic images, improving the depth perception and resolution of anatomic cardiac details and blood vessels compared to those of standard two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex and debilitating illness with a significant global prevalence, affecting over 65 million individuals. It affects various systems, including the immune, neurological, gastrointestinal, and circulatory systems. Studies have shown abnormalities in immune cell types, increased inflammatory cytokines, and brain abnormalities. Further research is needed to identify consistent biomarkers and develop targeted therapies. This study uses explainable artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to identify discriminative metabolites for ME/CFS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The model investigates a metabolomics dataset of CFS patients and healthy controls, including 26 healthy controls and 26 ME/CFS patients aged 22-72. The dataset encapsulated 768 metabolites into nine metabolic super-pathways: amino acids, carbohydrates, cofactors, vitamins, energy, lipids, nucleotides, peptides, and xenobiotics. Random forest methods together with other classifiers were applied to the data to classify individuals as ME/CFS patients and healthy individuals. The classification learning algorithms' performance in the validation step was evaluated using a variety of methods, including the traditional hold-out validation method, as well as the more modern cross-validation and bootstrap methods. Explainable artificial intelligence approaches were applied to clinically explain the optimum model's prediction decisions. RESULTS: The metabolomics of C-glycosyltryptophan, oleoylcholine, cortisone, and 3-hydroxydecanoate were determined to be crucial for ME/CFS diagnosis. The random forest model outperformed the other classifiers in ME/CFS prediction using the 1000-iteration bootstrapping method, achieving 98% accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, 0.01 Brier score, and 99% AUC. According to the obtained results, the bootstrap validation approach demonstrated the highest classification outcomes. CONCLUSION: The proposed model accurately classifies ME/CFS patients based on the selected biomarker candidate metabolites. It offers a clear interpretation of risk estimation for ME/CFS, aiding physicians in comprehending the significance of key metabolomic features within the model.

Journal Title: American journal of medical genetics. Part A
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: PURPOSE: The precision medicine era has seen increased utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of genetics. We sought to explore the ways that genetic counselors (GCs) currently use the publicly accessible AI tool Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in their work. METHODS: GCs in North America were surveyed about how ChatGPT is used in different aspects of their work. Descriptive statistics were reported through frequencies and means. RESULTS: Of 118 GCs who completed the survey, 33.8% (40) reported using ChatGPT in their work; 47.5% (19) use it in clinical practice, 35% (14) use it in education, and 32.5% (13) use it in research. Most GCs (62.7%; 74) felt that it saves time on administrative tasks but the majority (82.2%; 97) felt that a paramount challenge was the risk of obtaining incorrect information. The majority of GCs not using ChatGPT (58.9%; 46) felt it was not necessary for their work. CONCLUSION: A considerable number of GCs in the field are using ChatGPT in different ways, but it is primarily helpful with tasks that involve writing. It has potential to streamline workflow issues encountered in clinical genetics, but practitioners need to be informed and uniformly trained about its limitations.

Title: Methods for using Bing's AI-powered search engine for data extraction for a systematic review.
Author: ['Hill JE', 'Harris C', 'Clegg A']
Journal Title: Research synthesis methods
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Data extraction is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task in the systematic review process. Natural language processing (NLP) artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to automate data extraction saving time and resources, accelerating the review process, and enhancing the quality and reliability of extracted data. In this paper, we propose a method for using Bing AI and Microsoft Edge as a second reviewer to verify and enhance data items first extracted by a single human reviewer. We describe a worked example of the steps involved in instructing the Bing AI Chat tool to extract study characteristics as data items from a PDF document into a table so that they can be compared with data extracted manually. We show that this technique may provide an additional verification process for data extraction where there are limited resources available or for novice reviewers. However, it should not be seen as a replacement to already established and validated double independent data extraction methods without further evaluation and verification. Use of AI techniques for data extraction in systematic reviews should be transparently and accurately described in reports. Future research should focus on the accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and user experience of using Bing AI for data extraction compared with traditional methods using two or more reviewers independently.

Author: ['Park EY', 'Jeong S', 'Kang S', 'Cho J', 'Cho JY', 'Kim EK']
Journal Title: BMC oral health
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Owing to the remarkable advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, AI-based detection of dental caries is continuously improving. We evaluated the efficacy of the detection of dental caries with quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. METHODS: Overall, 2814 QLF intraoral images were obtained from 606 participants at a dental clinic using Qraypen C(R) (QC, AIOBIO, Seoul, Republic of Korea) from October 2020 to October 2022. These images included all the types of permanent teeth of which surfaces were smooth or occlusal. Dataset were randomly assigned to the training (56.0%), validation (14.0%), and test (30.0%) subsets of the dataset for caries classification. Moreover, masked images for teeth area were manually prepared to evaluate the segmentation efficacy. To compare diagnostic performance for caries classification according to the types of teeth, the dataset was further classified into the premolar (1,143 images) and molar (1,441 images) groups. As the CNN model, Xception was applied. RESULTS: Using the original QLF images, the performance of the classification algorithm was relatively good showing 83.2% of accuracy, 85.6% of precision, and 86.9% of sensitivity. After applying the segmentation process for the tooth area, all the performance indics including 85.6% of accuracy, 88.9% of precision, and 86.9% of sensitivity were improved. However, the performance indices of each type of teeth (both premolar and molar) were similar to those for all teeth. CONCLUSION: The application of AI to QLF images for caries classification demonstrated a good performance regardless of teeth type among posterior teeth. Additionally, tooth area segmentation through background elimination from QLF images exhibited a better performance.

Title: Impact of automatic acquisition of key clinical information on the accuracy of electrocardiogram interpretation: a cross-sectional study.
Author: ['Guo S', 'Zhang B', 'Feng Y', 'Wang Y', 'Tse G', 'Liu T', 'Chen KY']
Journal Title: BMC medical education
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The accuracy of electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation by doctors are affected by the available clinical information. However, having a complete set of clinical details before making a diagnosis is very difficult in the clinical setting especially in the early stages of the admission process. Therefore, we developed an artificial intelligence-assisted ECG diagnostic system (AI-ECG) using natural language processing to provide screened key clinical information during ECG interpretation. METHODS: Doctors with varying levels of training were asked to make diagnoses from 50 ECGs using a common ECG diagnosis system that does not contain clinical information. After a two-week-blanking period, the same set of ECGs was reinterpreted by the same doctors with AI-ECG containing clinical information. Two cardiologists independently provided diagnostic criteria for 50 ECGs, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or, if necessary, by a third cardiologist. The accuracy of ECG interpretation was assessed, with each response scored as correct/partially correct = 1 or incorrect = 0. RESULTS: The mean accuracy of ECG interpretation was 30.2% and 36.2% with the common ECG system and AI-ECG system, respectively. Compared to the unaided ECG system, the accuracy of interpretation was significantly improved with the AI-ECG system (P for paired t-test = 0.002). For senior doctors, no improvement was found in ECG interpretation accuracy, while an AI-ECG system was associated with 27% higher mean scores (24.3 +/- 9.4% vs. 30.9 +/- 10.6%, P = 0.005) for junior doctors. CONCLUSION: Intelligently screened key clinical information could improve the accuracy of ECG interpretation by doctors, especially for junior doctors.

Journal Title: Nature reviews. Drug discovery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling, an approach that was introduced 60 years ago, is widely used in computer-aided drug design. In recent years, progress in artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep learning, the rapid growth of databases of molecules for virtual screening and dramatic improvements in computational power have supported the emergence of a new field of QSAR applications that we term 'deep QSAR'. Marking a decade from the pioneering applications of deep QSAR to tasks involved in small-molecule drug discovery, we herein describe key advances in the field, including deep generative and reinforcement learning approaches in molecular design, deep learning models for synthetic planning and the application of deep QSAR models in structure-based virtual screening. We also reflect on the emergence of quantum computing, which promises to further accelerate deep QSAR applications and the need for open-source and democratized resources to support computer-aided drug design.

Title: [Big data and artificial intelligence in anesthesia : Reality or fiction?].
Author: ['Sander J', 'Simon P', 'Hinske C']
Journal Title: Die Anaesthesiologie
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Big data and artificial intelligence are buzzwords that everyone is talking about and yet always provide a touch of science fiction to the scenery. What is the status of these topics in anesthesia? Are the first robots already rolling through the corridors while doctors are getting bored as all the work has been done? Spoiler alert! We are still far away from achieving this. Initially, paper charts and analogue notes stand in the way of comprehensive digitization. Source systems need to be merged and data standardized, harmonized and validated. Therefore, the friendly android that is rolling towards us, waving and holding a freshly brewed cup of coffee in our thoughts will have to wait; however, a glimpse of the future is already evident in some clinics and the first promising developments are already showing what could be the standard tomorrow. Learning algorithms calculate the length of stay individually for each patient in the intensive care unit (ICU), reducing negative consequences such as readmission and mortality. The field of ultrasound technology for regional anesthesia and closed-loop anesthesia systems is also demonstrating the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in practice. The efforts are diverse and ambitious but they repeatedly collide with privacy challenges and significant capital expenditure, which weigh heavily on an already financially strained healthcare system; however, anyone who listens carefully to the medical staff knows that robots are not what they would expect and the buzzwords big data and artificial intelligence might be less science fiction than initially assumed.

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) system that reconstructs virtual 3D thin-section CT (TSCT) images from conventional CT images by applying deep learning was developed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether virtual and real TSCT could measure the solid size of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The pair of original thin-CT and simulated thick-CT from the training data with TSCT images (thickness, 0.5-1.0 mm) of 2700 pulmonary nodules were used to train the thin-CT generator in the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework and develop a virtual TSCT AI system. For validation, CT images of 93 stage 0-I lung adenocarcinomas were collected, and virtual TSCTs were reconstructed from conventional 5-mm thick-CT images using the AI system. Two radiologists measured and compared the solid size of tumors on conventional CT and virtual and real TSCT. The agreement between the two observers showed an almost perfect agreement on the virtual TSCT for solid size measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.967, P < 0.001, respectively). The virtual TSCT had a significantly stronger correlation than that of conventional CT (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively). The degree of agreement between the clinical T stage determined by virtual TSCT and the clinical T stage determined by real TSCT was excellent in both observers (k = 0.882 and k = 0.881, respectively). The AI system developed in this study was able to measure the solid size of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma on virtual TSCT as well as on real TSCT.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal diseases, characterized by a treatment-resistant and invasive nature. In line with these inherent aggressive characteristics, only a subset of patients shows a clinical response to the standard of care therapies, thereby highlighting the need for a more personalized treatment approach. In this study, we comprehensively unraveled the intra-patient response heterogeneity and intrinsic aggressive nature of PDAC on bulk and single-organoid resolution. We leveraged a fully characterized PDAC organoid panel (N = 8) and matched our artificial intelligence-driven, live-cell organoid image analysis with retrospective clinical patient response. In line with the clinical outcomes, we identified patient-specific sensitivities to the standard of care therapies (gemcitabine-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) using a growth rate-based and normalized drug response metric. Moreover, the single-organoid analysis was able to detect resistant as well as invasive PDAC organoid clones, which was orchestrates on a patient, therapy, drug, concentration and time-specific level. Furthermore, our in vitro organoid analysis indicated a correlation with the matched patient progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the current, conventional drug response readouts. This work not only provides valuable insights on the response complexity in PDAC, but it also highlights the potential applications (extendable to other tumor types) and clinical translatability of our approach in drug discovery and the emerging era of personalized medicine.

Abstract: Over the past decade, automation of digital image analysis has become commonplace in both research and clinical settings. Spurred by recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), tissue sub-compartments and cellular phenotypes within those compartments can be identified with higher throughput and accuracy than ever before. Recently, immune checkpoints have emerged as potential targets for auto-immune diseases. As such, spatial identification of these proteins along with immune cell markers (e.g., CD3(+)/LAG3(+) T-cells) is a crucial step in understanding the potential and/or efficacy of such treatments. Here, we describe a semi-automated imaging and analysis pipeline that identifies CD3(+)/LAG3(+) cells in colorectal tissue sub-compartments. While chromogenic staining has been a clinical mainstay and the resulting brightfield images have been utilized in AI/ML approaches in the past, there are associated drawbacks in phenotyping algorithms that can be overcome by fluorescence imaging. To address these tradeoffs, we developed an analysis pipeline combining the strengths of brightfield and fluorescence images. In this assay, immunofluorescence imaging was conducted to identify phenotypes followed by coverslip removal and hematoxylin and eosin staining of the same section to inform an AI/ML tissue segmentation algorithm. This assay proved to be robust in both tissue segmentation and phenotyping, was compatible with automated workflows, and revealed presence of LAG3(+) T-cells in ulcerative colitis biopsies with spatial context preserved.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with approximately 90% of the 250,000 deaths per year occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Secondary prevention with cervical screening involves detecting and treating precursor lesions; however, scaling screening efforts in LMIC has been hampered by infrastructure and cost constraints. Recent work has supported the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline on digital images of the cervix to achieve an accurate and reliable diagnosis of treatable precancerous lesions. In particular, WHO guidelines emphasize visual triage of women testing positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) as the primary screen, and AI could assist in this triage task. In this work, we implemented a comprehensive deep-learning model selection and optimization study on a large, collated, multi-geography, multi-institution, and multi-device dataset of 9462 women (17,013 images). We evaluated relative portability, repeatability, and classification performance. The top performing model, when combined with HPV type, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89 within our study population of interest, and a limited total extreme misclassification rate of 3.4%, on held-aside test sets. Our model also produced reliable and consistent predictions, achieving a strong quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.86 and a minimal %2-class disagreement (% 2-Cl. D.) of 0.69%, between image pairs across women. Our work is among the first efforts at designing a robust, repeatable, accurate and clinically translatable deep-learning model for cervical screening.

Title: Doctors' perceptions of using their digital twins in patient care.
Author: ['Zalake M']
Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have facilitated tools capable of generating digital twins of real human faces and voices for interactive communication. In this research, we explore utilizing Digital Twins of Doctors (DTDs) in healthcare because using a doctor's identity can provide benefits like enhancing the credibility of the health information delivered using computers. DTDs are computer-controlled AI-generated digital replicas of doctors that closely resemble their characteristics. However, there exist limitations, including the social implications of using a doctor's identity, potential negative impacts on doctor-patient communication, and liability concerns. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of DTD usage in healthcare before widespread adoption, systematic research is essential. As a step towards this direction, in this qualitative research, we report findings from 13 semi-structured interviews with doctors. Our findings indicate that doctors believe DTDs offer benefits by saving doctors' time through the efficient delivery of repetitive information and personalizing patient care. Moreover, while using a doctor's identity can enhance credibility, it also raises concerns about using a doctor's identity to spread potential misinformation. These findings contribute by informing future researchers about doctors' perspectives on utilizing DTDs in healthcare, guiding the development of effective implementation strategies for responsible DTD integration into healthcare.

Title: Arithmetic skills are associated with left fronto-temporal gray matter volume in 536 children and adolescents.
Author: ['Viesel-Nordmeyer N', 'Prado J']
Journal Title: NPJ science of learning
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: There are large individual differences in arithmetic skills. Although a number of brain-wide association studies have attempted to identify the neural correlates of these individual differences, studies have focused on relatively small sample sizes and have yielded inconsistent results. In the current voxel-based morphometry study, we merged six structural imaging datasets of children and adolescents (from 7.5 to 15 years) whose levels of arithmetic skills were assessed, leading to a combined sample of n = 536. Controlling for individual differences in age, gender, as well as language, and intelligence, we found a unique positive relation between arithmetic skill and gray matter volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Our results suggest that individual differences in arithmetic skills are associated with structural differences in left fronto-temporal areas, rather than in regions of the parietal cortex and hippocampus that are often associated with arithmetic processing.
