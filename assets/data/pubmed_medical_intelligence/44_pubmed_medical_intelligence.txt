Abstract: BACKGROUND: Owing to the remarkable advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, AI-based detection of dental caries is continuously improving. We evaluated the efficacy of the detection of dental caries with quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. METHODS: Overall, 2814 QLF intraoral images were obtained from 606 participants at a dental clinic using Qraypen C(R) (QC, AIOBIO, Seoul, Republic of Korea) from October 2020 to October 2022. These images included all the types of permanent teeth of which surfaces were smooth or occlusal. Dataset were randomly assigned to the training (56.0%), validation (14.0%), and test (30.0%) subsets of the dataset for caries classification. Moreover, masked images for teeth area were manually prepared to evaluate the segmentation efficacy. To compare diagnostic performance for caries classification according to the types of teeth, the dataset was further classified into the premolar (1,143 images) and molar (1,441 images) groups. As the CNN model, Xception was applied. RESULTS: Using the original QLF images, the performance of the classification algorithm was relatively good showing 83.2% of accuracy, 85.6% of precision, and 86.9% of sensitivity. After applying the segmentation process for the tooth area, all the performance indics including 85.6% of accuracy, 88.9% of precision, and 86.9% of sensitivity were improved. However, the performance indices of each type of teeth (both premolar and molar) were similar to those for all teeth. CONCLUSION: The application of AI to QLF images for caries classification demonstrated a good performance regardless of teeth type among posterior teeth. Additionally, tooth area segmentation through background elimination from QLF images exhibited a better performance.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The accuracy of electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation by doctors are affected by the available clinical information. However, having a complete set of clinical details before making a diagnosis is very difficult in the clinical setting especially in the early stages of the admission process. Therefore, we developed an artificial intelligence-assisted ECG diagnostic system (AI-ECG) using natural language processing to provide screened key clinical information during ECG interpretation. METHODS: Doctors with varying levels of training were asked to make diagnoses from 50 ECGs using a common ECG diagnosis system that does not contain clinical information. After a two-week-blanking period, the same set of ECGs was reinterpreted by the same doctors with AI-ECG containing clinical information. Two cardiologists independently provided diagnostic criteria for 50 ECGs, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or, if necessary, by a third cardiologist. The accuracy of ECG interpretation was assessed, with each response scored as correct/partially correct = 1 or incorrect = 0. RESULTS: The mean accuracy of ECG interpretation was 30.2% and 36.2% with the common ECG system and AI-ECG system, respectively. Compared to the unaided ECG system, the accuracy of interpretation was significantly improved with the AI-ECG system (P for paired t-test = 0.002). For senior doctors, no improvement was found in ECG interpretation accuracy, while an AI-ECG system was associated with 27% higher mean scores (24.3 +/- 9.4% vs. 30.9 +/- 10.6%, P = 0.005) for junior doctors. CONCLUSION: Intelligently screened key clinical information could improve the accuracy of ECG interpretation by doctors, especially for junior doctors.

Journal Title: Nature reviews. Drug discovery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling, an approach that was introduced 60 years ago, is widely used in computer-aided drug design. In recent years, progress in artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep learning, the rapid growth of databases of molecules for virtual screening and dramatic improvements in computational power have supported the emergence of a new field of QSAR applications that we term 'deep QSAR'. Marking a decade from the pioneering applications of deep QSAR to tasks involved in small-molecule drug discovery, we herein describe key advances in the field, including deep generative and reinforcement learning approaches in molecular design, deep learning models for synthetic planning and the application of deep QSAR models in structure-based virtual screening. We also reflect on the emergence of quantum computing, which promises to further accelerate deep QSAR applications and the need for open-source and democratized resources to support computer-aided drug design.

Title: [Big data and artificial intelligence in anesthesia : Reality or fiction?].
Author: ['Sander J', 'Simon P', 'Hinske C']
Journal Title: Die Anaesthesiologie
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Big data and artificial intelligence are buzzwords that everyone is talking about and yet always provide a touch of science fiction to the scenery. What is the status of these topics in anesthesia? Are the first robots already rolling through the corridors while doctors are getting bored as all the work has been done? Spoiler alert! We are still far away from achieving this. Initially, paper charts and analogue notes stand in the way of comprehensive digitization. Source systems need to be merged and data standardized, harmonized and validated. Therefore, the friendly android that is rolling towards us, waving and holding a freshly brewed cup of coffee in our thoughts will have to wait; however, a glimpse of the future is already evident in some clinics and the first promising developments are already showing what could be the standard tomorrow. Learning algorithms calculate the length of stay individually for each patient in the intensive care unit (ICU), reducing negative consequences such as readmission and mortality. The field of ultrasound technology for regional anesthesia and closed-loop anesthesia systems is also demonstrating the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in practice. The efforts are diverse and ambitious but they repeatedly collide with privacy challenges and significant capital expenditure, which weigh heavily on an already financially strained healthcare system; however, anyone who listens carefully to the medical staff knows that robots are not what they would expect and the buzzwords big data and artificial intelligence might be less science fiction than initially assumed.

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) system that reconstructs virtual 3D thin-section CT (TSCT) images from conventional CT images by applying deep learning was developed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether virtual and real TSCT could measure the solid size of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The pair of original thin-CT and simulated thick-CT from the training data with TSCT images (thickness, 0.5-1.0 mm) of 2700 pulmonary nodules were used to train the thin-CT generator in the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework and develop a virtual TSCT AI system. For validation, CT images of 93 stage 0-I lung adenocarcinomas were collected, and virtual TSCTs were reconstructed from conventional 5-mm thick-CT images using the AI system. Two radiologists measured and compared the solid size of tumors on conventional CT and virtual and real TSCT. The agreement between the two observers showed an almost perfect agreement on the virtual TSCT for solid size measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.967, P < 0.001, respectively). The virtual TSCT had a significantly stronger correlation than that of conventional CT (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively). The degree of agreement between the clinical T stage determined by virtual TSCT and the clinical T stage determined by real TSCT was excellent in both observers (k = 0.882 and k = 0.881, respectively). The AI system developed in this study was able to measure the solid size of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma on virtual TSCT as well as on real TSCT.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal diseases, characterized by a treatment-resistant and invasive nature. In line with these inherent aggressive characteristics, only a subset of patients shows a clinical response to the standard of care therapies, thereby highlighting the need for a more personalized treatment approach. In this study, we comprehensively unraveled the intra-patient response heterogeneity and intrinsic aggressive nature of PDAC on bulk and single-organoid resolution. We leveraged a fully characterized PDAC organoid panel (N = 8) and matched our artificial intelligence-driven, live-cell organoid image analysis with retrospective clinical patient response. In line with the clinical outcomes, we identified patient-specific sensitivities to the standard of care therapies (gemcitabine-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) using a growth rate-based and normalized drug response metric. Moreover, the single-organoid analysis was able to detect resistant as well as invasive PDAC organoid clones, which was orchestrates on a patient, therapy, drug, concentration and time-specific level. Furthermore, our in vitro organoid analysis indicated a correlation with the matched patient progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the current, conventional drug response readouts. This work not only provides valuable insights on the response complexity in PDAC, but it also highlights the potential applications (extendable to other tumor types) and clinical translatability of our approach in drug discovery and the emerging era of personalized medicine.

Abstract: Over the past decade, automation of digital image analysis has become commonplace in both research and clinical settings. Spurred by recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), tissue sub-compartments and cellular phenotypes within those compartments can be identified with higher throughput and accuracy than ever before. Recently, immune checkpoints have emerged as potential targets for auto-immune diseases. As such, spatial identification of these proteins along with immune cell markers (e.g., CD3(+)/LAG3(+) T-cells) is a crucial step in understanding the potential and/or efficacy of such treatments. Here, we describe a semi-automated imaging and analysis pipeline that identifies CD3(+)/LAG3(+) cells in colorectal tissue sub-compartments. While chromogenic staining has been a clinical mainstay and the resulting brightfield images have been utilized in AI/ML approaches in the past, there are associated drawbacks in phenotyping algorithms that can be overcome by fluorescence imaging. To address these tradeoffs, we developed an analysis pipeline combining the strengths of brightfield and fluorescence images. In this assay, immunofluorescence imaging was conducted to identify phenotypes followed by coverslip removal and hematoxylin and eosin staining of the same section to inform an AI/ML tissue segmentation algorithm. This assay proved to be robust in both tissue segmentation and phenotyping, was compatible with automated workflows, and revealed presence of LAG3(+) T-cells in ulcerative colitis biopsies with spatial context preserved.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with approximately 90% of the 250,000 deaths per year occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Secondary prevention with cervical screening involves detecting and treating precursor lesions; however, scaling screening efforts in LMIC has been hampered by infrastructure and cost constraints. Recent work has supported the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline on digital images of the cervix to achieve an accurate and reliable diagnosis of treatable precancerous lesions. In particular, WHO guidelines emphasize visual triage of women testing positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) as the primary screen, and AI could assist in this triage task. In this work, we implemented a comprehensive deep-learning model selection and optimization study on a large, collated, multi-geography, multi-institution, and multi-device dataset of 9462 women (17,013 images). We evaluated relative portability, repeatability, and classification performance. The top performing model, when combined with HPV type, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89 within our study population of interest, and a limited total extreme misclassification rate of 3.4%, on held-aside test sets. Our model also produced reliable and consistent predictions, achieving a strong quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.86 and a minimal %2-class disagreement (% 2-Cl. D.) of 0.69%, between image pairs across women. Our work is among the first efforts at designing a robust, repeatable, accurate and clinically translatable deep-learning model for cervical screening.

Title: Doctors' perceptions of using their digital twins in patient care.
Author: ['Zalake M']
Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have facilitated tools capable of generating digital twins of real human faces and voices for interactive communication. In this research, we explore utilizing Digital Twins of Doctors (DTDs) in healthcare because using a doctor's identity can provide benefits like enhancing the credibility of the health information delivered using computers. DTDs are computer-controlled AI-generated digital replicas of doctors that closely resemble their characteristics. However, there exist limitations, including the social implications of using a doctor's identity, potential negative impacts on doctor-patient communication, and liability concerns. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of DTD usage in healthcare before widespread adoption, systematic research is essential. As a step towards this direction, in this qualitative research, we report findings from 13 semi-structured interviews with doctors. Our findings indicate that doctors believe DTDs offer benefits by saving doctors' time through the efficient delivery of repetitive information and personalizing patient care. Moreover, while using a doctor's identity can enhance credibility, it also raises concerns about using a doctor's identity to spread potential misinformation. These findings contribute by informing future researchers about doctors' perspectives on utilizing DTDs in healthcare, guiding the development of effective implementation strategies for responsible DTD integration into healthcare.

Title: Arithmetic skills are associated with left fronto-temporal gray matter volume in 536 children and adolescents.
Author: ['Viesel-Nordmeyer N', 'Prado J']
Journal Title: NPJ science of learning
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: There are large individual differences in arithmetic skills. Although a number of brain-wide association studies have attempted to identify the neural correlates of these individual differences, studies have focused on relatively small sample sizes and have yielded inconsistent results. In the current voxel-based morphometry study, we merged six structural imaging datasets of children and adolescents (from 7.5 to 15 years) whose levels of arithmetic skills were assessed, leading to a combined sample of n = 536. Controlling for individual differences in age, gender, as well as language, and intelligence, we found a unique positive relation between arithmetic skill and gray matter volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Our results suggest that individual differences in arithmetic skills are associated with structural differences in left fronto-temporal areas, rather than in regions of the parietal cortex and hippocampus that are often associated with arithmetic processing.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Urine cytology, although a useful screening method for urothelial carcinoma, lacks sensitivity. As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) improved image analysis accuracy significantly. OBJECTIVE: To develop a fully automated AI system to assist pathologists in the histological prediction of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) from digitized urine cytology slides. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We digitized 535 consecutive urine cytology slides for AI use. Among these slides, 181 were used for AI development, 39 were used as AI test data to identify HGUC by cell-level classification, and 315 were used as AI test data for slide-level classification. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Out of the 315 slides, 171 were collected immediately prior to bladder biopsy or transurethral resection of bladder tumor, and then outcomes were compared with the histological presence of HGUC in the surgical specimen. The primary aim was to compare AI prediction of the histological presence of HGUC with the pathologist's histological diagnosis of HGUC. Secondary aims were to compare the time required for AI evaluation and concordance between the AI's classification and pathologist's cytology diagnosis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The AI capability for predicting the histological presence of HGUC was 0.78 for the area under the curve. Comparing the AI predictive performance with pathologists' diagnosis, the AI sensitivity of 63% for histological HGUC prediction was superior to a pathologists' cytology sensitivity of 46% (p = 0.0037). On the contrary, there was no significant difference between the AI specificity of 83% and pathologists' specificity of 89% (p = 0.13), and AI accuracy of 74% and pathologists' accuracy of 68% (p = 0.08). The time required for AI evaluation was 139 s. With respect to the concordance between the AI prediction and pathologist's cytology diagnosis, the accuracy was 86%. Agreements with positive and negative findings were 92% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a fully automated AI system to assist pathologists' histological diagnosis of HGUC using digitized slides. This AI system showed significantly higher sensitivity than a board-certified cytopathologist and may assist pathologists in making urine cytology diagnoses, reducing their workload. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we present a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) system that classifies urine cytology slides according to the Paris system. An automated AI system was developed and validated with 535 consecutive urine cytology slides. The AI predicted histological high-grade urothelial carcinoma from digitized urine cytology slides with superior sensitivity than pathologists, while maintaining comparable specificity and accuracy.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: PURPOSE:  The determination of bone age (BA) based on the hand and wrist, using the 70-year-old Greulich and Pyle (G&P) atlas, remains a widely employed practice in various institutions today. However, a more recent approach utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) enables automated BA estimation based on the G&P atlas. Nevertheless, AI-based methods encounter limitations when dealing with images that deviate from the standard hand and wrist projections. Generally, the extent to which BA, as determined by the G&P atlas, corresponds to the chronological age (CA) of a contemporary German population remains a subject of continued discourse. This study aims to address two main objectives. Firstly, it seeks to investigate whether the G&P atlas, as applied by the AI software, is still relevant for healthy children in Germany today. Secondly, the study aims to assess the performance of the AI software in handling non-strict posterior-anterior (p. a.) projections of the hand and wrist. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The AI software retrospectively estimated the BA in children who had undergone radiographs of a single hand using posterior-anterior and oblique planes. The primary purpose was to rule out any osseous injuries. The prediction error of BA in relation to CA was calculated for each plane and between the two planes. RESULTS:  A total of 1253 patients (aged 3 to 16 years, median age 10.8 years, 55.7 % male) were included in the study. The average error of BA in posterior-anterior projections compared to CA was 3.0 (+/- 13.7) months for boys and 1.7 (+/- 13.7) months for girls. Interestingly, the deviation from CA tended to be even slightly lower in oblique projections than in posterior-anterior projections. The mean error in the posterior-anterior projection plane was 2.5 (+/- 13.7) months, while in the oblique plane it was 1.8 (+/- 13.9) months (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION:  The AI software for BA generally corresponds to the age of the contemporary German population under study, although there is a noticeable prediction error, particularly in younger children. Notably, the software demonstrates robust performance in oblique projections. KEY POINTS:   . Bone age, as determined by artificial intelligence, aligns with the chronological age of the contemporary German cohort under study.. . As determined by artificial intelligence, bone age is remarkably robust, even when utilizing oblique X-ray projections..

Journal Title: Gastrointestinal endoscopy
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) is widely used in diagnosing small bowel Crohn's disease (CD). However, CD misdiagnosis frequently occurs if inexperienced endoscopists cannot accurately detect the lesions. The CD evaluation may also be inaccurate and less objective due to the subjectivity of endoscopists. Our study aims to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect and objectively assess small bowel CD for more refined disease management. METHODS: We collected 28155 small bowel DBE images from 628 patients between January 2018 and December 2022. Four expert gastroenterologists labeled the images, and at least two endoscopists made the final decision with an agreement. A state-of-the-art deep learning model EfficientNet-b5 was trained to detect CD lesions and evaluate CD ulcers. The detection included lesions of ulcer, non-inflammatory stenosis, and inflammatory stenosis. Ulcer grading had ulcerated surface, ulcer size, and ulcer depth. A comparison of AI model performance with endoscopists was performed. RESULTS: The EfficientNet-b5 achieved high accuracies of 96.3% (95% CI, 95.7%-96.7%), 95.7% (95% CI, 95.1%-96.2%), and 96.7% (95% CI, 96.2%-97.2%) for the detection of ulcers, non-inflammatory stenosis, and inflammatory stenosis, respectively. In ulcer grading, the EfficientNet-b5 exhibited average accuracies of 87.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-89.6%) for grading the ulcerated surface, 87.8% (95% CI, 85.0%-90.2%) for grading the size of ulcers, and 85.2% (95% CI, 83.2%-87.0%) for the ulcer depth assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The EfficientNet-b5 achieved high accuracy in detecting CD lesions and grading CD ulcers. The AI model can provide expert-level accuracy and objective evaluation of small bowel CD to optimize the clinical treatment plans.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To develop an artificial intelligence-based software system for predicting late-onset sepsis (LOS) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). STUDY DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective cohort study, conducted in the NICU of the Antwerp University Hospital. Continuous monitoring data of 865 preterm infants born at <32 weeks gestational age, admitted to the NICU in the first week of life, were used to train an XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithm for LOS and NEC prediction in a cross-validated setup. Afterward, the model's performance was assessed on an independent test set of 148 patients (internal validation). RESULTS: The ML model delivered hourly risk predictions with an overall sensitivity of 69% (142/206) for all LOS/NEC episodes and 81% (67/83) for severe LOS/NEC episodes. The model showed a median time gain of </=10 hours (IQR, 3.1-21.0 hours), compared with historical clinical diagnosis. On the complete retrospective dataset, the ML model made 721 069 predictions, of which 9805 (1.3%) depicted a LOS/NEC probability of >/=0.15, resulting in a total alarm rate of <1 patient alarm-day per week. The model reached a similar performance on the internal validation set. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence technology can assist clinicians in the early detection of LOS and NEC in the NICU, which potentially can result in clinical and socioeconomic benefits. Additional studies are required to quantify further the effect of combining artificial and human intelligence on patient outcomes in the NICU.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided analysis of chest CT expedites the quantification of abnormalities and may facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of the prognosis of subjects with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the performance of an AI-aided quantification model in predicting the clinical outcomes of hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 and compares it with radiologists' performance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 subjects with COVID-19 (men, n = 59 [65.6%]; age, 52.9+/-16.7 years) were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Quantification of the total and compromised lung parenchyma was performed by two expert radiologists using a volumetric image analysis software and compared against an AI-assisted package consisting of a modified U-Net model for segmenting COVID-19 lesions and an off-the-shelf U-Net model augmented with COVID-19 data for segmenting lung volume. The fraction of compromised lung parenchyma (%CL) was calculated. Based on clinical results, the subjects were divided into two categories: critical (n = 45) and noncritical (n = 45). All admission data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was an excellent agreement between the radiologist-obtained and AI-assisted measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88, P < 0.001). Both the AI-assisted and radiologist-obtained %CLs were significantly higher in the critical subjects (P = 0.009 and 0.02, respectively) than in the noncritical subjects. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis to distinguish the critical subjects, an AI-assisted %CL >/=35% (odds ratio [OR] = 17.0), oxygen saturation level of <88% (OR = 33.6), immunocompromised condition (OR = 8.1), and other comorbidities (OR = 15.2) independently remained as significant variables in the models. Our proposed model obtained an accuracy of 83.9%, a sensitivity of 79.1%, and a specificity of 88.6% in predicting critical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: AI-assisted measurements are similar to quantitative radiologist-obtained measurements in determining lung involvement in COVID-19 subjects.

Title: Impacts of visual impairment on pragmatic impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Author: ['Lulu C', 'Xie H', 'Wang P', 'Zhang T']
Journal Title: PloS one
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Consideration for patients with visual impairment, from low vision to blindness, is an important part of building a barrier-free society. Some authors have elaborated that visual impairment can indeed lead to delayed development in theory of mind, thereby causing pragmatic knowledge deficiency. Verifying whether those with eye conditions have pragmatic impairment is an essential way for their clinical evaluation, intervention and rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: We primarily carry out a meta-analysis of visual impairment from low vision to blindness and pragmatic impairment in people with low vision or blindness to verify visual impairment may cause pragmatic impairment. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases Pubmed, Medline, MesH, Psychinfo, Ovid, EBSCO and CNKI and the reference sections of previous reviews. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included when they built on primary data from clinical questionnaire surveys or field trials anywhere in the world, and when they reported impacts of visual impairment on social cognition, communication, skills, behavior and intelligence. In total, 25 original studies were included, in which 25735 people were evaluated. RESULTS: Statistically, visual impairments and pragmatic impairment exist correlation due to the significant p value(p = 0.0005 < 0.05) in group and the subgroup sorted in the light of 18 years old (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003 < 0.05). Psychologically, because people with visual impairment can not normally get non-verbal information, they can not get a complete pragmatic knowledge system. Pragmatic knowledge deficiency leads to abnormal in executive functions and development delay from the perspective of theory of mind, inducing pragmatic impairment. Therefore, visual impairment has an impact on pragmatic impairment. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis reveals robust evidence on the relationship of vision impairment and pragmatic impairment in children or adults. Such evidence may help to gradually improve the clinical evaluation, intervention and rehabilitation of these people.

Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI), conceived in the 1950s, has permeated numerous industries, intensifying in tandem with advancements in computing power. Despite the widespread adoption of AI, its integration into medicine trails other sectors. However, medical AI research has experienced substantial growth, attracting considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. OBJECTIVE: In the absence of an existing framework, this study aims to outline the current landscape of medical AI research and provide insights into its future developments by examining all AI-related studies within PubMed over the past 2 decades. We also propose potential data acquisition and analysis methods, developed using Python (version 3.11) and to be executed in Spyder IDE (version 5.4.3), for future analogous research. METHODS: Our dual-pronged approach involved (1) retrieving publication metadata related to AI from PubMed (spanning 2000-2022) via Python, including titles, abstracts, authors, journals, country, and publishing years, followed by keyword frequency analysis and (2) classifying relevant topics using latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach, and defining the research scope of AI in medicine. In the absence of a universal medical AI taxonomy, we used an AI dictionary based on the European Commission Joint Research Centre AI Watch report, which emphasizes 8 domains: reasoning, planning, learning, perception, communication, integration and interaction, service, and AI ethics and philosophy. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2022, a comprehensive analysis of 307,701 AI-related publications from PubMed highlighted a 36-fold increase. The United States emerged as a clear frontrunner, producing 68,502 of these articles. Despite its substantial contribution in terms of volume, China lagged in terms of citation impact. Diving into specific AI domains, as the Joint Research Centre AI Watch report categorized, the learning domain emerged dominant. Our classification analysis meticulously traced the nuanced research trajectories across each domain, revealing the multifaceted and evolving nature of AI's application in the realm of medicine. CONCLUSIONS: The research topics have evolved as the volume of AI studies increases annually. Machine learning remains central to medical AI research, with deep learning expected to maintain its fundamental role. Empowered by predictive algorithms, pattern recognition, and imaging analysis capabilities, the future of AI research in medicine is anticipated to concentrate on medical diagnosis, robotic intervention, and disease management. Our topic modeling outcomes provide a clear insight into the focus of AI research in medicine over the past decades and lay the groundwork for predicting future directions. The domains that have attracted considerable research attention, primarily the learning domain, will continue to shape the trajectory of AI in medicine. Given the observed growing interest, the domain of AI ethics and philosophy also stands out as a prospective area of increased focus.

Title: Artificial Intelligence Augmented Qualitative Analysis: The Way of the Future?
Author: ['Hitch D']
Journal Title: Qualitative health research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is here and gathering momentum, thanks to new models of natural language processing (NLP) and rapidly increasing adoption by the public. NLP technology uses statistical analysis of language structures to analyse and generate human language, using text or speech as its source material. It can also be applied to visual mediums like images and videos. A few qualitative research early adopters are beginning to adopt this technology into their work, but our understanding of its potential remains in its infancy. This article will define and describe NLP-based AI and discuss its benefits and limitations for reflexive thematic analysis in health research. While there are many platforms available, ChatGPT is the most well-known and accessible. A worked example using ChatGPT to augment reflexive thematic analysis is provided to illustrate potential application in practice. This article is intended to inspire further conversation around the role of AI in qualitative research and offer practical guidance for researchers seeking to adopt this technology.

Journal Title: Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: PURPOSE: Novel approaches are needed to ensure all patients with cancer have access to quality genetic education before genetic testing to enable informed treatment decisions. The purpose of this study was to test the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) intervention for the delivery of genetic education by non-genetic providers to patients with cancer undergoing active treatment. METHODS: A conversational AI-based application was developed on the HealthFAX platform to provide tailored genetic education to patients with cancer and tested at Johns Hopkins Hospital between April 2021 and Feb 2022. Patients' responses around the adoption, use, and experience of the AI application were assessed. RESULTS: Out of 64 individuals who consented to the study, 51 accessed the tool. The responding participants had a mean age of 61 years (ranging from 30-90 years) with 39 individuals undergoing active treatment for breast cancer and 12 for advanced prostate cancer. All patients chose to complete the tool at home. The median time between study enrollment and AI application initiation was 1 day, and the median time to complete the application was 24 min. All participants in their survey responses felt that the tool was secure, easy to use, liked the convenience of viewing it at home, and felt it provided valuable information. Eighteen percent of participants viewed the application with a family member. Ninety-eight percent of the participants completed their genetic education prior to receiving their test results. In 16%, a pathogenic variant was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The 51 patients who adopted the AI application were highly satisfied with its usability and convenience. Our results support the continued evaluation of this cost-effective AI application in a large-scale study. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Tailored pre-test genetic education can be successfully delivered to patients with cancer undergoing active treatment via an AI application at their convenience.

Journal Title: Cognitive processing
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: The association between language and mathematics is an important debated topic. Here, we proposed a structure correspondence hypothesis to explain under what conditions language and mathematics are closely related. According to the hypothesis, there would be an association when they have equivalent structure. One hundred and fifty high school students were recruited to finish mathematical and language tests at the element level (i.e., geometric term processing and word analogy) and at the low-dimensional combination level (i.e., geometric principle processing and sentence completion) as well as the tests to measure cognitive covariates (general intelligence and spatial processing). After controlling for age, gender and cognitive covariates, geometric term processing and word analogy were closely correlated, and geometric principle processing and sentence completion were significantly correlated. No other correlations were found. The results support the structure correspondence hypothesis and provide a new perspective of structure of language and verbalized mathematics for the relation between language and mathematics.
