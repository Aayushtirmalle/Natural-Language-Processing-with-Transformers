Author: ['Nourse R', 'Dingler T', 'Kelly J', 'Kwasnicka D', 'Maddison R']
Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: The effective management of chronic conditions requires an approach that promotes a shift in care from the clinic to the home, improves the efficiency of health care systems, and benefits all users irrespective of their needs and preferences. Digital health can provide a solution to this challenge, and in this paper, we provide our vision for a smart health ecosystem. A smart health ecosystem leverages the interoperability of digital health technologies and advancements in big data and artificial intelligence for data collection and analysis and the provision of support. We envisage that this approach will allow a comprehensive picture of health, personalization, and tailoring of behavioral and clinical support; drive theoretical advancements; and empower people to manage their own health with support from health care professionals. We illustrate the concept with 2 use cases and discuss topics for further consideration and research, concluding with a message to encourage people with chronic conditions, their caregivers, health care professionals, policy and decision makers, and technology experts to join their efforts and work toward adopting a smart health ecosystem.

Title: Existing Barriers Faced by and Future Design Recommendations for Direct-to-Consumer Health Care Artificial Intelligence Apps: Scoping Review.
Author: ['He X', 'Zheng X', 'Ding H']
Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Direct-to-consumer (DTC) health care artificial intelligence (AI) apps hold the potential to bridge the spatial and temporal disparities in health care resources, but they also come with individual and societal risks due to AI errors. Furthermore, the manner in which consumers interact directly with health care AI is reshaping traditional physician-patient relationships. However, the academic community lacks a systematic comprehension of the research overview for such apps. OBJECTIVE: This paper systematically delineated and analyzed the characteristics of included studies, identified existing barriers and design recommendations for DTC health care AI apps mentioned in the literature and also provided a reference for future design and development. METHODS: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines and was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley's 5-stage framework. Peer-reviewed papers on DTC health care AI apps published until March 27, 2023, in Web of Science, Scopus, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar were included. The papers were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's reflective thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Of the 2898 papers retrieved, 32 (1.1%) covering this emerging field were included. The included papers were recently published (2018-2023), and most (23/32, 72%) were from developed countries. The medical field was mostly general practice (8/32, 25%). In terms of users and functionalities, some apps were designed solely for single-consumer groups (24/32, 75%), offering disease diagnosis (14/32, 44%), health self-management (8/32, 25%), and health care information inquiry (4/32, 13%). Other apps connected to physicians (5/32, 16%), family members (1/32, 3%), nursing staff (1/32, 3%), and health care departments (2/32, 6%), generally to alert these groups to abnormal conditions of consumer users. In addition, 8 barriers and 6 design recommendations related to DTC health care AI apps were identified. Some more subtle obstacles that are particularly worth noting and corresponding design recommendations in consumer-facing health care AI systems, including enhancing human-centered explainability, establishing calibrated trust and addressing overtrust, demonstrating empathy in AI, improving the specialization of consumer-grade products, and expanding the diversity of the test population, were further discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The booming DTC health care AI apps present both risks and opportunities, which highlights the need to explore their current status. This paper systematically summarized and sorted the characteristics of the included studies, identified existing barriers faced by, and made future design recommendations for such apps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically summarize and categorize academic research on these apps. Future studies conducting the design and development of such systems could refer to the results of this study, which is crucial to improve the health care services provided by DTC health care AI apps.

Journal Title: La Radiologia medica
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The accurate identification and evaluation of lymph nodes by CT images is of great significance for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. PURPOSE: To assess the lymph nodes' segmentation, size, and station by artificial intelligence (AI) for unenhanced chest CT images and evaluate its value in clinical scenarios. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study proposed an end-to-end Lymph Nodes Analysis System (LNAS) consisting of three models: the Lymph Node Segmentation model (LNS), the Mediastinal Organ Segmentation model (MOS), and the Lymph Node Station Registration model (LNR). We selected a healthy chest CT image as the template image and annotated 14 lymph node station masks according to the IASLC to build the lymph node station mapping template. The exact contours and stations of the lymph nodes were annotated by two junior radiologists and reviewed by a senior radiologist. Patients aged 18 and above, who had undergone unenhanced chest CT and had at least one suspicious enlarged mediastinal lymph node in imaging reports, were included. Exclusions were patients who had thoracic surgeries in the past 2 weeks or artifacts on CT images affecting lymph node observation by radiologists. The system was trained on 6725 consecutive chest CTs that from Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, among which 6249 patients had suspicious enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A total of 519 consecutive chest CTs from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Qingdao) were used for external validation. The gold standard for each CT was determined by two radiologists and reviewed by one senior radiologist. RESULTS: The patient-level sensitivity of the LNAS system reached of 93.94% and 92.89% in internal and external test dataset, respectively. And the lesion-level sensitivity (recall) reached 89.48% and 85.97% in internal and external test dataset. For man-machine comparison, AI significantly apparently shortened the average reading time (p < 0.001) and had better lesion-level and patient-level sensitivities. CONCLUSION: AI improved the sensitivity lymph node segmentation by radiologists with an advantage in reading time.

Author: ['Liao L', 'Lei Z', 'Tang C', 'Bai R', 'Wang X']
Journal Title: Applied optics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: Phase unwrapping plays a pivotal role in optics and is a key step in obtaining phase information. Recently, owing to the rapid development of artificial intelligence, a series of deep-learning-based phase-unwrapping methods has garnered considerable attention. Among these, a representative deep-learning model called U (2)-net has shown potential for various phase-unwrapping applications. This study proposes a U (2)-net-based phase-unwrapping model to explore the performance differences between the U (2)-net and U-net. To this end, first, the U-net, U (2)-net, and U (2)-net-lite models are trained simultaneously, then their prediction accuracy, noise resistance, generalization capability, and model weight size are compared. The results show that the U (2)-net model outperformed the U-net model. In particular, the U (2)-net-lite model achieved the same performance as that of the U (2)-net model while reducing the model weight size to 6.8% of the original U (2)-net model, thereby realizing a lightweight model.

Title: Causal relationship between sleep traits and cognitive impairment: A Mendelian randomization study.
Author: ['Wang Q', 'Xu S', 'Liu F', 'Liu Y', 'Chen K', 'Huang L', 'Xu F', 'Liu Y']
Journal Title: Journal of evidence-based medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Observational studies had demonstrated a link between sleep disturbances and cognitive decline. Here, we aimed to investigate the causal association between genetically predicted sleep traits and cognitive impairment using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: Using strict criteria, we selected genetic variants from European ancestry Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the Sleep Disorders Knowledge Portal and UK Biobank as instrumental variables for several sleep traits, including insomnia, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, daytime napping, and chronotype. Summary statistics related to cognitive impairment were derived from five different GWAS, including the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium. The role of self-reported sleep trait phenotypes in the etiology of cognitive impairment was explored using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) tests, MR-Egger tests, and weighted medians, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure robustness. RESULTS: In the main IVW analysis, sleep duration (reaction time: beta = -0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.04, p = 1.93x10(-12) ), daytime sleepiness (average cortical thickness: beta = -0.12, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.02, p = 0.023), and daytime napping (fluid intelligence: beta = -0.47, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.07, p = 0.021; hippocampal volume in Alzheimer's disease: beta = -0.99, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.35, p = 0.002) were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive performance. However, any effects of insomnia and chronotype on cognitive impairment were not determined. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted that focusing on sleep behaviors or distinct sleep patterns-particularly sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and daytime napping, was a promising approach for preventing cognitive impairment. This study also shed light on risk factors for and potential early markers of cognitive impairment risk factors.

Author: ['Lu Y', 'Pareek A', 'Yang L', 'Rouzrokh P', 'Khosravi B', 'Okoroha KR', 'Krych AJ', 'Camp CL']
Journal Title: Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: An increased posterior tibial slope (PTS) corresponds with an increased risk of graft failure after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Validated methods of manual PTS measurements are subject to potential interobserver variability and can be inefficient on large datasets. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To develop a deep learning artificial intelligence technique for automated PTS measurement from standard lateral knee radiographs. It was hypothesized that this deep learning tool would be able to measure the PTS on a high volume of radiographs expeditiously and that these measurements would be similar to previously validated manual measurements. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A deep learning U-Net model was developed on a cohort of 300 postoperative short-leg lateral radiographs from patients who underwent ACLR to segment the tibial shaft, tibial joint surface, and tibial tuberosity. The model was trained via a random split after an 80 to 20 train-validation scheme. Masks for training images were manually segmented, and the model was trained for 400 epochs. An image processing pipeline was then deployed to annotate and measure the PTS using the predicted segmentation masks. Finally, the performance of this combined pipeline was compared with human measurements performed by 2 study personnel using a previously validated manual technique for measuring the PTS on short-leg lateral radiographs on an independent test set consisting of both pre- and postoperative images. RESULTS: The U-Net semantic segmentation model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.885 on the validation cohort. The mean difference between the human-made and computer-vision measurements was 1.92 degrees  (sigma = 2.81 degrees  [P = .24]). Extreme disagreements between the human and machine measurements, as defined by >/=5 degrees differences, occurred <5% of the time. The model was incorporated into a web-based digital application front-end for demonstration purposes, which can measure a single uploaded image in Portable Network Graphics format in a mean time of 5 seconds. CONCLUSION: We developed an efficient and reliable deep learning computer vision algorithm to automate the PTS measurement on short-leg lateral knee radiographs. This tool, which demonstrated good agreement with human annotations, represents an effective clinical adjunct for measuring the PTS as part of the preoperative assessment of patients with ACL injuries.

Title: Trust toward humans and trust toward artificial intelligence are not associated: Initial insights from self-report and neurostructural brain imaging.
Author: ['Montag C', 'Klugah-Brown B', 'Zhou X', 'Wernicke J', 'Liu C', 'Kou J', 'Chen Y', 'Haas BW', 'Becker B']
Journal Title: Personality neuroscience
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The present study examines whether self-reported trust in humans and self-reported trust in [(different) products with built-in] artificial intelligence (AI) are associated with one another and with brain structure. We sampled 90 healthy participants who provided self-reported trust in humans and AI and underwent brain structural magnetic resonance imaging assessment. We found that trust in humans, as measured by the trust facet of the personality inventory NEO-PI-R, and trust in AI products, as measured by items assessing attitudes toward AI and by a composite score based on items assessing trust toward products with in-built AI, were not significantly correlated. We also used a concomitant dimensional neuroimaging approach employing a data-driven source-based morphometry (SBM) analysis of gray-matter-density to investigate neurostructural associations with each trust domain. We found that trust in humans was negatively (and significantly) correlated with an SBM component encompassing striato-thalamic and prefrontal regions. We did not observe significant brain structural association with trust in AI. The present findings provide evidence that trust in humans and trust in AI seem to be dissociable constructs. While the personal disposition to trust in humans might be "hardwired" to the brain's neurostructural architecture (at least from an individual differences perspective), a corresponding significant link for the disposition to trust AI was not observed. These findings represent an initial step toward elucidating how different forms of trust might be processed on the behavioral and brain level.

Journal Title: Journal of medicine and life
Publication Date: 2023 Sep
Abstract: This study aimed to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting perinatal outcomes among women with COVID-19. Data was collected from hospitals in the Middle Euphrates and Southern regions of Iraq, with 152 pregnant patients included in the study. Patients were categorized into mild and severe infection groups, and their serum samples were analyzed for mineral levels (magnesium, copper, calcium, sodium, potassium, zinc, selenium, and iron) and immune factors (IL-6, IL-8, IL-32, IL-10, IL-18, IL-37, IL-38, IL-36, and IL-1). The findings revealed significant associations between specific mineral levels, immune factors, and perinatal outcomes. Mineral levels such as magnesium (75.5% mild infection, 80.9% severe infection), copper (68.2% mild infection, 64.3% severe infection), calcium ion (81.8% mild infection, 76.2% severe infection), sodium (70.9% mild infection, 69.0% severe infection), potassium (72.7% mild infection, 71.4% severe infection), zinc (61.8% mild infection, 54.8% severe infection), selenium (78.2% mild infection, 82.9% severe infection), and iron (74.5% mild infection, 68.3% severe infection) showed varying percentages associated with mild and severe infections. Immune factors such as IL-6 (32% mild infection, 21% severe infection), IL-8 (15% mild infection, 7% severe infection), IL-32 (24% mild infection, 9% severe infection), IL-10 (7% mild infection, no severe infection), IL-18 (13% mild infection, 11% severe infection) demonstrated varying percentages associated with perinatal outcomes, while other interleukins showed no changes in severe infections. These results highlight the potential of AI in predicting outcomes for pregnant women with COVID-19, which could aid in improving their management and care. Further research and validation of predictive models are recommended to enhance accuracy and applicability.

Title: Imaging Findings of Nodular Fasciitis in Breast including Artificial Intelligence Mammography and Shear Wave Elastography: A Case Report.
Author: ['Park SH', 'Park JY', 'Joo M', 'Kim JI']
Journal Title: Journal of the Korean Society of Radiology
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Nodular fasciitis is a benign fibroblastic proliferation rarely reported in the breast. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with imaging findings that resembled a malignancy. Mammography revealed an isodense nodule with partially indistinct margin in the right breast, showing the abnormality score 75% on artificial intelligence. Ultrasonography revealed an oval hypoechoic nodule with microlobulated margin, echogenic halo, increased blood flow, and soft elasticity. After core needle biopsy and excision, nodular fasciitis was diagnosed. Although nodular fasciitis of the breast is rare, it may mimic malignancy; therefore, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis to prevent unnecessary intervention.

Abstract: Key unmet needs in multiple sclerosis (MS) include detection of early pathology, disability worsening independent of relapses, and accurate monitoring of treatment response. Collaborative approaches to address these unmet needs have been driven in part by industry-academic networks and initiatives such as the Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovation (GMSI) and Multiple Sclerosis Leadership and Innovation Network (MS-LINK()) programs. We review the application of recent advances, supported by the GMSI and MS-LINK() programs, in neuroimaging technology to quantify pathology related to central pathology and disease worsening, and potential for their translation into clinical practice/trials. GMSI-supported advances in neuroimaging methods and biomarkers include developments in magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, ocular imaging, and machine learning. However, longitudinal studies are required to facilitate translation of these measures to the clinic and to justify their inclusion as endpoints in clinical trials of new therapeutics for MS. Novel neuroimaging measures and other biomarkers, combined with artificial intelligence, may enable accurate prediction and monitoring of MS worsening in the clinic, and may also be used as endpoints in clinical trials of new therapies for MS targeting relapse-independent disease pathology.

Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The human factor plays a key role in the automotive field since most accidents are due to drivers' unsafe and risky behaviors. The industry is now pursuing two main solutions to deal with this concern: in the short term, there is the development of systems monitoring drivers' psychophysical states, such as inattention and fatigue, and in the medium-long term, there is the development of fully autonomous driving. This second solution is promoted by recent technological progress in terms of Artificial Intelligence and sensing systems aimed at making vehicles more and more accurately aware of their "surroundings." However, even with an autonomous vehicle, the driver should be able to take control of the vehicle when needed, especially during the current transition from the lower (SAE < 3) to the highest level (SAE = 5) of autonomous driving. In this scenario, the vehicle has to be aware not only of its "surroundings" but also of the driver's psychophysical state, i.e., a user-centered Artificial Intelligence. The neurophysiological approach is one the most effective in detecting improper mental states. This is particularly true if considering that the more automatic the driving will be, the less available the vehicular data related to the driver's driving style. The present study aimed at employing a holistic approach, considering simultaneously several neurophysiological parameters, in particular, electroencephalographic, electrooculographic, photopletismographic, and electrodermal activity data to assess the driver's mental fatigue in real time and to detect the onset of fatigue increasing. This would ideally work as an information/trigger channel for the vehicle AI. In all, 26 professional drivers were engaged in a 45-min-lasting realistic driving task in simulated conditions, during which the previously listed biosignals were recorded. Behavioral (reaction times) and subjective measures were also collected to validate the experimental design and to support the neurophysiological results discussion. Results showed that the most sensitive and timely parameters were those related to brain activity. To a lesser extent, those related to ocular parameters were also sensitive to the onset of mental fatigue, but with a delayed effect. The other investigated parameters did not significantly change during the experimental session.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies are here to stay and cannot be ignored. These tools are able to generate highly-realistic human-like text and perform a wide range of useful language tasks with a wide range of applications. They have the potential to expedite innovation in health care and can aid in promoting equity and diversity in research by overcoming language barriers. When using these AI tools, authors must take responsibility for the output and originality of their work, as publishers expect all content to be generated by human authors unless there is a declaration to the contrary. Authors must disclose how AI tools have been used, and ensure appropriate attribution of all the text, images, and audio-visual material. The responsible use of AI language models and transparent reporting of how these tools were used in the creation of information and publication are vital to promote and protect the credibility and integrity of medical research, and trust in medical knowledge. Educating postgraduate and undergraduate students, researchers and authors on the applications and best usage of AI-assisted technologies, together with the importance of critical thinking, integrity and strict adherence to ethical principles, are key steps that need to be undertaken.

Title: Exploration on flexible wearable sensor motion monitoring based on novel functional polymer conjugated materials.
Author: ['Zhang J', 'Ding H']
Journal Title: Frontiers in chemistry
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: With the continuous development of flexible electronics, multi-functional device integration, artificial intelligence technology, etc., flexible wearable sensors are playing an increasingly important role in people's daily motion monitoring. However, current flexible wearable sensors have problems such as low accuracy, poor real-time performance, and poor stability in motion monitoring, which seriously hinder the better application of flexible wearable sensors and are not conducive to the collection and monitoring of motion signals. To this end, this paper designed a flexible wearable sensor motion monitoring system and tested its performance through the preparation and performance research of new functional polymer conjugated materials. The research results show that the motion monitoring system designed based on the new functional polymer conjugated material flexible wearable sensor has good monitoring accuracy and real-time performance. When the output data is 500 pieces, the running monitoring accuracy reaches 95.4%, and the monitoring feedback time is 0.321 s; the high jump movement monitoring accuracy rate reaches 97%, and the monitoring feedback time is 0.287 s; the long jump movement monitoring accuracy rate reaches 96%, and the monitoring feedback time is 0.296 s. This shows that the flexible wearable sensor motion monitoring system of this paper has better performance and can meet the current demand for accuracy and real-time motion monitoring. This study highlights the impact of new functional polymer conjugated materials on flexible wearable sensors, helping to further solve the deficiencies of flexible wearable sensors in sports monitoring and promote their better development.

Title: ChatGPT Performance in Diagnostic Clinical Microbiology Laboratory-Oriented Case Scenarios.
Author: ['Sallam M', 'Al-Salahat K', 'Al-Ajlouni E']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools can reshape healthcare practice. This includes ChatGPT which is considered among the most popular AI-based conversational models. Nevertheless, the performance of different versions of ChatGPT needs further evaluation in different settings to assess its reliability and credibility in various healthcare-related tasks. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the performance of the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 and the paid version ChatGPT-4 in 10 different diagnostic clinical microbiology case scenarios. METHODS: The current study followed the METRICS (Model, Evaluation, Timing/Transparency, Range/Randomization, Individual factors, Count, Specificity of the prompts/language) checklist for standardization of the design and reporting of AI-based studies in healthcare. The models tested on December 3, 2023 included ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 and the evaluation of the ChatGPT-generated content was based on the CLEAR tool (Completeness, Lack of false information, Evidence support, Appropriateness, and Relevance) assessed on a 5-point Likert scale with a range of the CLEAR scores of 1-5. ChatGPT output was evaluated by two raters independently and the inter-rater agreement was based on the Cohen's kappa statistic. Ten diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory case scenarios were created in the English language by three microbiologists at diverse levels of expertise following an internal discussion of common cases observed in Jordan. The range of topics included bacteriology, mycology, parasitology, and virology cases. Specific prompts were tailored based on the CLEAR tool and a new session was selected following prompting each case scenario. RESULTS: The Cohen's kappa values for the five CLEAR items were 0.351-0.737 for ChatGPT-3.5 and 0.294-0.701 for ChatGPT-4 indicating fair to good agreement and suitability for analysis. Based on the average CLEAR scores, ChatGPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (mean: 2.64+/-1.06 vs. 3.21+/-1.05, P=.012, t-test). The performance of each model varied based on the CLEAR items, with the lowest performance for the "Relevance" item (2.15+/-0.71 for ChatGPT-3.5 and 2.65+/-1.16 for ChatGPT-4). A statistically significant difference upon assessing the performance per each CLEAR item was only seen in ChatGPT-4 with the best performance in "Completeness", "Lack of false information", and "Evidence support" (P=0.043). The lowest level of performance for both models was observed with antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) queries while the highest level of performance was seen in bacterial and mycologic identification. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of ChatGPT performance across different diagnostic clinical microbiology case scenarios showed that ChatGPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT-3.5. The performance of ChatGPT demonstrated noticeable variability depending on the specific topic evaluated. A primary shortcoming of both ChatGPT models was the tendency to generate irrelevant content lacking the needed focus. Although the overall ChatGPT performance in these diagnostic microbiology case scenarios might be described as "above average" at best, there remains a significant potential for improvement, considering the identified limitations and unsatisfactory results in a few cases.

Title: Is ChatGPT accurate and reliable in answering questions regarding head and neck cancer?
Author: ['Kuscu O', 'Pamuk AE', 'Sutay Suslu N', 'Hosal S']
Journal Title: Frontiers in oncology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based language processing model using deep learning to create human-like text dialogue. It has been a popular source of information covering vast number of topics including medicine. Patient education in head and neck cancer (HNC) is crucial to enhance the understanding of patients about their medical condition, diagnosis, and treatment options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT in answering questions regarding HNC. METHODS: 154 head and neck cancer-related questions were compiled from sources including professional societies, institutions, patient support groups, and social media. These questions were categorized into topics like basic knowledge, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, operative risks, complications, follow-up, and cancer prevention. ChatGPT was queried with each question, and two experienced head and neck surgeons assessed each response independently for accuracy and reproducibility. Responses were rated on a scale: (1) comprehensive/correct, (2) incomplete/partially correct, (3) a mix of accurate and inaccurate/misleading, and (4) completely inaccurate/irrelevant. Discrepancies in grading were resolved by a third reviewer. Reproducibility was evaluated by repeating questions and analyzing grading consistency. RESULTS: ChatGPT yielded "comprehensive/correct" responses to 133/154 (86.4%) of the questions whereas, rates of "incomplete/partially correct" and "mixed with accurate and inaccurate data/misleading" responses were 11% and 2.6%, respectively. There were no "completely inaccurate/irrelevant" responses. According to category, the model provided "comprehensive/correct" answers to 80.6% of questions regarding "basic knowledge", 92.6% related to "diagnosis", 88.9% related to "treatment", 80% related to "recovery - operative risks - complications - follow-up", 100% related to "cancer prevention" and 92.9% related to "other". There was not any significant difference between the categories regarding the grades of ChatGPT responses (p=0.88). The rate of reproducibility was 94.1% (145 of 154 questions). CONCLUSION: ChatGPT generated substantially accurate and reproducible information to diverse medical queries related to HNC. Despite its limitations, it can be a useful source of information for both patients and medical professionals. With further developments in the model, ChatGPT can also play a crucial role in clinical decision support to provide the clinicians with up-to-date information.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous in human society, and yet vast segments of the global population have no, little, or counterproductive information about AI. It is necessary to teach AI topics on a mass scale. While there is a rush to implement academic initiatives, scant attention has been paid to the unique challenges of teaching AI curricula to a global and culturally diverse audience with varying expectations of privacy, technological autonomy, risk preference, and knowledge sharing. Our study fills this void by focusing on AI elements in a new framework titled Culturally Adaptive Thinking in Education for AI (CATE-AI) to enable teaching AI concepts to culturally diverse learners. Failure to contextualize and sensitize AI education to culture and other categorical human-thought clusters, can lead to several undesirable effects including confusion, AI-phobia, cultural biases to AI, increased resistance toward AI technologies and AI education. We discuss and integrate human behavior theories, AI applications research, educational frameworks, and human centered AI principles to articulate CATE-AI. In the first part of this paper, we present the development a significantly enhanced version of CATE. In the second part, we explore textual data from AI related news articles to generate insights that lay the foundation for CATE-AI, and support our findings. The CATE-AI framework can help learners study artificial intelligence topics more effectively by serving as a basis for adapting and contextualizing AI to their sociocultural needs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) programs generate responses to input text, showcasing their innovative capabilities in education and demonstrating various potential benefits, particularly in the field of medical education. The current knowledge of health profession students about AI programs has still not been assessed in Jordan and the West Bank of Palestine (WBP). AIM: This study aimed to assess students' awareness and practice of AI programs in medicine and pharmacy in Jordan and the WBP. METHODS: This study was in the form of an observational, cross-sectional survey. A questionnaire was electronically distributed among students of medicine and pharmacy at An-Najah National University (WBP), Al-Isra University (Jordan), and Al-Balqa Applied University (Jordan). The questionnaire consisted of three main categories: sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, practice of AI programs, and perceptions of AI programs, including ChatGPT. RESULTS: A total of 321 students responded to the distributed questionnaire, and 261 participants (81.3%) stated that they had heard about AI programs. In addition, 135 participants had used AI programs before (42.1%), while less than half the participants used them in their university studies (44.2%): for drug information (44.5%), homework (38.9%), and writing research articles (39.3%). There was significantly (48.3%, P<0.005) more conviction in the use of AI programs for writing research articles among pharmacy students from Palestine compared to Jordan. Lastly, there was significantly more (53.8%, P<0.05) AI program use among medicine students than pharmacy students. CONCLUSION: While most medicine and pharmacy students had heard about AI programs, only a small proportion of the participants had used them in their medical study. In addition, attitudes and practice related to AI programs in their education differs between medicine and pharmacy students and between WBP and Jordan.

Journal Title: Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine
Publication Date: 2022
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the first and second causes of death in over 130 countries across the world. They are also among the top three causes in almost 180 countries worldwide. Cardiovascular complications are often noticed in cancer patients, with nearly 20% exhibiting cardiovascular comorbidities. Physical exercise may be helpful for cancer survivors and people living with cancer (PLWC), as it prevents relapses, CVD, and cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is beneficial to recommend exercise as part of cardio-oncology preventive care. OBJECTIVE: With the progress of deep learning algorithms and the improvement of big data processing techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become popular in the fields of medicine and healthcare. In the context of the shortage of medical resources in China, it is of great significance to adopt AI and machine learning methods for prescription recommendations. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based intelligent system of exercise prescription for cardio-oncology preventive care, and this paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: This will be a retrospective machine learning modeling cohort study with interventional methods (i.e., exercise prescription). We will recruit PLWC participants at baseline (from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2026) and follow up over several years (from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2028). Specifically, participants will be eligible if they are (1) PLWC in Stage I or cancer survivors from Stage I; (2) aged between 18 and 55 years; (3) interested in physical exercise for rehabilitation; (4) willing to wear smart sensors/watches; (5) assessed by doctors as suitable for exercise interventions. At baseline, clinical exercise physiologist certificated by the joint training program (from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024) of American College of Sports Medicine and Chinese Association of Sports Medicine will recommend exercise prescription to each participant. During the follow-up, effective exercise prescription will be determined by assessing the CVD status of the participants. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: This study aims to develop not only an interpretable machine learning model to recommend exercise prescription but also an intelligent system of exercise prescription for precision cardio-oncology preventive care. ETHICS: This study is approved by Human Experimental Ethics Inspection of Guangzhou Sport University. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2300077887.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Breast ultrasound suffers from low positive predictive value and specificity. Artificial intelligence (AI) proposes to improve accuracy, reduce false negatives, reduce inter- and intra-observer variability and decrease the rate of benign biopsies. Perpetuating racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare and patient outcome is a potential risk when incorporating AI-based models into clinical practice; therefore, it is necessary to validate its non-bias before clinical use. APPROACH: Our retrospective review assesses whether our AI decision support (DS) system demonstrates racial/ethnic bias by evaluating its performance on 1810 biopsy proven cases from nine breast imaging facilities within our health system from January 1, 2018 to October 28, 2021. Patient age, gender, race/ethnicity, AI DS output, and pathology results were obtained. RESULTS: Significant differences in breast pathology incidence were seen across different racial and ethnic groups. Stratified analysis showed that the difference in output by our AI DS system was due to underlying differences in pathology incidence for our specific cohort and did not demonstrate statistically significant bias in output among race/ethnic groups, suggesting similar effectiveness of our AI DS system among different races (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows promise that an AI DS system may serve as a valuable second opinion in the detection of breast cancer on diagnostic ultrasound without significant racial or ethnic bias. AI tools are not meant to replace the radiologist, but rather to aid in screening and diagnosis without perpetuating racial/ethnic disparities.
