Title: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 GenoAnalyzer and mutagenic anomaly detector using FCMFI and NSCE.
Author: ['Dubey S', 'Verma DK', 'Kumar M']
Journal Title: International journal of biological macromolecules
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: In order to deepen our understanding of the virus and help guide the creation of efficient therapies, this study uses artificial intelligence tools to thoroughly explore the genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The process starts by using the Fuzzy Closure Miner for Frequent Itemsets (FCMFI) on a large corpus of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to reveal hidden patterns, including nucleotides base sequences, repeating motifs, and corresponding interchanges. Then, using the Nucleotide Sequence Comprehension Engine (NSCE) technique, we were able to precisely define the genomic areas for mutation analysis. Structured and unstructured proteins are both strongly impacted by virus mutations, with spike proteins that are linked to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia being particularly affected. Notably, the Mutagenic Anomaly Detector shows a 65 % efficiency boost in computing genome mutation rates compared to conventional point mutation analysis, while GenoAnalyzer offers a remarkable 93.33 % improvement over existing approaches in recognizing common genomic sequence patterns. These results highlight the potential of FCMFI to reveal complex genomic patterns and significant insights in COVID-19 genetic sequences when combined with mutation analysis. The Mutagenic Anomaly Detector and GenoAnalyzer show promise for revealing hidden genomic patterns and precisely estimating the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate.

Author: ['Bcharah G', 'Gupta N', 'Panico N', 'Winspear S', 'Bagley A', 'Turnow M', "D'Amico R", 'Ukachukwu AE']
Journal Title: World neurosurgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: Neurosurgical technologies have become increasingly more adaptive, featuring real-time and patient-specific guidance in pre, intra, and postoperative settings. This review offers insight on how these integrative innovations compare to conventional approaches in spine surgery, focusing on Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), and Spinal Navigation Systems. Data on technology applications, diagnostic and procedural accuracy, intraoperative times, radiation exposures, post-operative outcomes, and costs were extracted and compared to conventional methods to assess their advantages and limitations. Preoperatively, AR and VR have applications in surgical training and planning that are more immersive, case-specific, and risk-free and have been shown to enhance accuracy and reduce complications. In addition, ML algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting surgical candidacy (up to 92.1%) and tailoring personalized treatments based on patient-specific variables. Intraoperatively, advantages include more accurate pedicle screw insertion (96-99% with ML), enhanced visualization, reduced radiation exposure (49 muSv with O-arm navigation vs. 556 muSv with fluoroscopy), increased efficiency, and potential for fewer intraoperative complications compared to conventional approaches. Postoperatively, certain ML and AI models have outperformed conventional methods in predicting all post-operative complications of 6000+ patients as well as predicting variables contributing to in-hospital and 90-day mortality. However, applying these technologies comes with limitations, such as longer operative times (up to 35.6% longer) with navigation, dataset dependencies, costs, accessibility, steep learning curve, and inherent software malfunctions. As these technologies advance, continuing to assess their efficacy and limitations will be imperative in their integration within spine surgery.

Journal Title: Multiple sclerosis and related disorders
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pediatric multiple sclerosis (PedMS) can hamper brain maturation. Aim of this study was to assess the neuropsychological profile of PedMS patients and their resting-state functional connectivity (RS FC). METHODS: We assessed intelligence quotient (IQ), executive speed, and language in 76 PedMS patients. On a 3.0T scanner RS FC of brain networks was estimated with a seed-based analysis (subset of 58 right-handed PedMS patients and 22 matched healthy controls). Comparisons were run between controls and PedMS (whole cohort and by age). RESULTS: Ninety-five% of patients had normal IQ. The highest rate of failure was observed in executive speed. PedMS showed reduced RS FC in all networks than controls, especially in the basal ganglia. In younger patients (<16-year-old, n = 32) reduced RS FC in the basal ganglia, language, and sensorimotor networks associated with poorer cognitive performance (p < 0.05; r range: 0.39; 0.56). Older patients (>/=16-year-old, n = 26) showed increased RS FC in the basal ganglia, default-mode, sensorimotor, executive, and language networks, associated with poorer performance in executive speed and language abilities (p < 0.05; r range: -0.40; -0.59). In both groups, lower RS FC of the caudate nucleus associated with poorer executive speed. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of PedMS on RS FC is clinically relevant and differs according to patients' age.

Author: ['Katwaroo AR', 'Adesh VS', 'Lowtan A', 'Umakanthan S']
Journal Title: Postgraduate medical journal
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 30
Abstract: In the evolution of modern medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to provide an integral aspect of revolutionizing clinical diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient care. With the potential to scrutinize colossal amounts of medical data, radiological and histological images, and genomic data in healthcare institutions, AI-powered systems can recognize, determine, and associate patterns and provide impactful insights that would be strenuous and challenging for clinicians to detect during their daily clinical practice. The outcome of AI-mediated search offers more accurate, personalized patient diagnoses, guides in research for new drug therapies, and provides a more effective multidisciplinary treatment plan that can be implemented for patients with chronic diseases. Among the many promising applications of AI in modern medicine, medical imaging stands out distinctly as an area with tremendous potential. AI-powered algorithms can now accurately and sensitively identify cancer cells and other lesions in medical images with greater accuracy and sensitivity. This allows for earlier diagnosis and treatment, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive insight into diagnostic, therapeutic, and ethical issues with the advent of AI in modern medicine.

Title: Anoikis regulator GLI2 promotes NC cell immunity escape by TGF-beta-mediated non-classic hedgehog signaling in colorectal cancer: based on artificial intelligence and big data analysis.
Author: ['Shanshan Z', 'Fanfei D', 'Xuan S', 'Huina L', 'Ye Z', 'Jiayu L', 'Shuo Z', 'Xue P', 'Yingye P', 'Chengjun J', 'Hang P', 'Li L']
Journal Title: Aging
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anoikis is a speed-limited procedure to inhibit tumor metastasis during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Previous studies have explored anoikis-related genes (ARG) in predicting prognosis and distinguishing tumoral immunity in many types of cancer. However, the role of ARGs in regulating NK cell exhaustion (NKE) and in predicting chemotherapy sensitivity is not clear. Therefore, it is necessary to work on it. METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical features are collected from TCGA and GEO, and data analysis is performed in R4.2.0. RESULTS: The ARGs-based no-supervised learning algorithm identifies three ARG subgroups, amongst which the prognosis is different. WCGNA and Artificial intelligence (AI) are applied to construct an NKE-related drug sensitivity stratification and prognosis identification model in digestive system cancer. Pathways association analysis screens out GLI2 is a key gene in regulating NKE by non-classic Hedgehog signaling (GLI2/TGF-beta/IL6). In vitro experiments show that down-regulation of GLI2 enhances the CAPE-mediated cell toxicity and accompanies with down-regulation of PD-L1, tumor-derive IL6, and snial1 whereas the expression of cleaved caspas3, cleaved caspase4, cleaved PARP, and E-cadherin are up-regulated in colorectal cancer. Co-culture experiments show that GLI2- decreased colorectal tumor cells lead to down-regulation of TIM-3 and PD1 in NK cells, which are restored by TGF-bate active protein powder. Besides, the Elisa assay shows that GLI2-decreased colorectal tumor cells lead to up-regulation of IFN-gamma in NK cells.

Journal Title: Current hypertension reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 30
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an important and well-established measure of arterial stiffness that is strongly associated with aging. Age-related alterations in the elastic properties and integrity of arterial walls can lead to cardiovascular disease. PWV measurements play an important role in the early detection of these changes, as well as other cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as hypertension. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge of the effects of aging on arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV. RECENT FINDINGS: This review highlights recent findings showing the applicability of PWV analysis for investigating heart failure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases, as well as cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease. It also discusses the clinical implications of utilizing PWV to monitor treatment outcomes, various challenges in implementing PWV assessment in clinical practice, and the development of new technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which may improve the usefulness of PWV measurements in the future. Measuring arterial stiffness through PWV remains an important technique to study aging, especially as the technology continues to evolve. There is a clear need to leverage PWV to identify interventions that mitigate age-related increases in PWV, potentially improving CVD outcomes and promoting healthy vascular aging.

Journal Title: Terapevticheskii arkhiv
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 3
Abstract: The review article highlights the main stages of the formation of computed tomography (CT) as a key method used in modern cardiology. The progress of CT scanners is directly related to the increase in the number of detectors, and thus, with an increase in the number of simultaneously collected projections. Modern developments and future technologies in the field of further development of the technique, including CT angiography and other new methods for assessing coronary blood flow, are discussed. The use of artificial intelligence technologies may make it possible to improve and accelerate the interpretation of the resulting images in the future, especially if it is economically justified.

Journal Title: Terapevticheskii arkhiv
Publication Date: 2023 Oct 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many COVID-19 survivors suffer from post-COVID syndrome, which significantly worsens the quality of life. Its presentation is quite diverse, with cognitive disorders being of particular importance. Liver injury due to the direct virus action and the treatment of the new coronavirus infection can persist for a long time during the recovery period and lead to hyperammonemia, which can cause cognitive disorders, including minimal hepatic encephalopathy. AIM: To study cognitive disorders in post-COVID syndrome and the possibility of their treatment with L-ornithine-L-aspartate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 30 students from 18 to 24 years old who had COVID-19 and decreased attention, memory impairment, and other cognitive disorders inherent in hepatic encephalopathy of latent (grade 0) or mild (grade 1) severity, without pronounced impairment of intelligence, memory, speech, and learning ability. Hyperammonemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and a-glutamyl transpeptidase, signs of hepatic encephalopathy according to psychometric tests, were reported in young people. All patients in the study were treated with L-ornithine-L-aspartate to correct the ammonia blood level and improve signs of hepatic encephalopathy and the general condition. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: An improvement in the objective findings, liver enzymes, a decrease in ammonia level, and an improvement in testing results for changes in cognitive functions were reported.

Journal Title: Abdominal radiology (New York)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare fully automated artificial intelligence body composition measures derived from thin (1.25 mm) and thick (5 mm) slice abdominal CT data. METHODS: In this retrospective study, fully automated CT-based body composition algorithms for quantifying bone attenuation, muscle attenuation, muscle area, liver attenuation, liver volume, spleen volume, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR) and aortic calcium were applied to both thin (1.25 x 0.625 mm) and thick (5 x 3 mm) abdominal CT series from two patient cohorts: unenhanced scans in asymptomatic adults undergoing colorectal cancer screening, and post-contrast scans in patients with colorectal cancer. Body composition measures derived from thin and thick slice data were compared, including correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: A total of 9882 CT scans (mean age, 57.0 years; 4527 women, 5355 men) were evaluated, including 8947 non-contrast and 935 contrast-enhanced CT exams. Very strong positive correlation was observed for all soft tissue measures: muscle attenuation (r(2) = 0.97), muscle area (r(2) = 0.98), liver attenuation (r(2) = 0.99), liver volume (r(2) = 0.98) and spleen volume (r(2) = 0.99), VSR (r(2) = 0.98), and aortic calcium (r(2) = 0.92); (p < 0.001 for all). Moderate positive correlation was observed for bone attenuation (r(2) = 0.35). Bland-Altman analysis showed strong agreement for muscle attenuation, muscle area, liver attenuation, liver volume and spleen volume. Mean percentage differences amongst body composition measures were less than 5% for VSR (4.6%), muscle area (- 0.5%), liver attenuation (0.4%) and liver volume (2.7%) and less than 10% for muscle attenuation (- 5.5%) and spleen volume (5.1%). For aortic calcium, thick slice overestimated for Agatston scores between 0 and 100 and > 400 burden in 3.1% and 0.3% relative to thin slice, respectively, but underestimated scores between 100 and 400. CONCLUSION: Automated body composition measures derived from thin and thick abdominal CT data are strongly correlated and show agreement, particularly for soft tissue applications, making it feasible to use either series for these CT-based body composition algorithms.

Journal Title: Radiologie (Heidelberg, Germany)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clinical method of choice for cartilage imaging in the context of degenerative and nondegenerative joint diseases. The MRI-based definitions of osteoarthritis rely on the detection of osteophytes, cartilage pathologies, bone marrow edema and meniscal lesions but currently a scientific consensus is lacking. In the clinical routine proton density-weighted, fat-suppressed 2D turbo spin echo sequences with echo times of 30-40 ms are predominantly used, which are sufficiently sensitive and specific for the assessment of cartilage. The additionally acquired T1-weighted sequences are primarily used for evaluating other intra-articular and periarticular structures. Diagnostically relevant artifacts include magic angle and chemical shift artifacts, which can lead to artificial signal enhancement in cartilage or incorrect representations of the subchondral lamina and its thickness. Although scientifically validated, high-resolution 3D gradient echo sequences (for cartilage segmentation) and compositional MR sequences (for quantification of physical tissue parameters) are currently reserved for scientific research questions. The future integration of artificial intelligence techniques in areas such as image reconstruction (to reduce scan times while maintaining image quality), image analysis (for automated identification of cartilage defects), and image postprocessing (for automated segmentation of cartilage in terms of volume and thickness) will significantly improve the diagnostic workflow and advance the field further.

Author: ['Berenguer C', 'Baixauli I', 'Rosa E', 'De Stasio S']
Journal Title: Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among children with neurodevelopmental disorders, like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hiperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The first objective of this study is to examine the differences in sleep problems between a group of children with ASD without intellectual disabilities, a group with ADHD and a typically developing (TD) group. A second objective is aimed at analyzing the effects of sleep problems and symptom severity on their communication skills. Participants were 122 children between 7 and 12 years old distributed in three groups: 32 TD children, 47 children with ASD and 43 children with ADHD, matched on age and intelligence. Parents completed different questionnaires that measured sleep disturbances and communication skills. Findings show significant differences between the clinical groups and the TD group in most types of sleep disorders. Moreover, the group with ADHD showed significantly more sleep breathing disorders and hyperhidrosis in comparison with ASD and TD, as well as more total sleep problems. In contrast to ASD, the predictive power of sleep problems on communication difficulties was greater in the group with ADHD. The results of the mediation analysis indicate that in both groups, sleep problems partially mediate the relationship between symptoms and communication. This investigation highlights the need of considering sleep disorders when assessing communication skills in ASD and ADHD, given its indirect influence in this domain. Understanding the sleep dysfunctions of both conditions and their repercussions is crucial to develop adjusted interventions.

Title: An artificial intelligence tool misclassifies sport science journals as predatory.
Author: ['Teixeira da Silva JA', 'Scelles N']
Journal Title: Journal of science and medicine in sport
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The choice of a scholarly journal, as opposed to a predatory journal, might impact a sport scientist's career negatively if the wrong choice is made, especially at an early stage of their research and publishing careers. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly impacting sport science and academia. In this study, we tested the accuracy and sensitivity of an AI-driven tool, applied specifically to sport science. DESIGN: Our research relies on the use of a new and free online AI-driven tool, the AJPC System, which claims the ability to distinguish "normal" (scholarly) from "suspected predatory" (unscholarly) journals. METHODS: The AJPC System was used to assess (1 December 2023) the classification of all ranked sport journals (n = 124), namely those in all four quartiles (Q1-Q4) of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), in the "Sports Science" category. RESULTS: The AJPC System considered 47/124 journals to be "suspected predatory", mostly in Q4 journals (54.8 % of total), casting a negative image on their academic standing. CONCLUSIONS: Sport scientists are likely to consider SJR Q1-Q4 journals to be relatively safe to publish in, reliable and reputable, and might be confused with the "suspected predatory" label assigned to 37.9 % of those journals. The AJPC System is thus misleading sport scientists.

Title: Advancements in artificial intelligence algorithms for dental implant identification: A systematic review with meta-analysis.
Author: ['Alqutaibi AY', 'Algabri RS', 'Elawady D', 'Ibrahim WI']
Journal Title: The Journal of prosthetic dentistry
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The evidence regarding the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in identifying dental implant systems is currently inconclusive. The available studies present varying results and methodologies, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to comprehensively analyze and evaluate articles that investigate the application of AI in identifying and classifying dental implant systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic systematic review was conducted across 3 databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus. Additionally, a manual search was performed. The inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed studies investigating the accuracy of AI-based diagnostic tools on dental radiographs for identifying and classifying dental implant systems and comparing the results with those obtained by expert judges using manual techniques-the search strategy encompassed articles published until September 2023. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of included articles. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible articles were included in this review. These articles described the use of AI in detecting dental implants through conventional radiographs. The pooled data showed that dental implant identification had an overall accuracy of 92.56% (range 90.49% to 94.63%). Eleven studies showed a low risk of bias, 6 demonstrated some concern risk, and 5 showed a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: AI models using panoramic and periapical radiographs can accurately identify and categorize dental implant systems. However, additional well-conducted research is recommended to identify the most common implant systems.

Title: Cross-sectional and prospective associations of early childhood circulating metals with early and mid-childhood cognition in the Project Viva cohort.
Author: ['Thilakaratne R', 'Lin PD', 'Rifas-Shiman SL', 'Landero J', 'Wright RO', 'Bellinger D', 'Oken E', 'Cardenas A']
Journal Title: Environmental research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about the immediate and prospective neurodevelopmental impacts of joint exposure to multiple metals (i.e., metal mixtures) in early childhood. OBJECTIVES: To estimate associations of early childhood ( approximately 3 years of age) blood metal concentrations with cognitive test scores at early and mid-childhood ( approximately 8 years of age). METHODS: We studied children from the Project Viva cohort. We measured erythrocyte concentrations of seven essential (Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Se, and Zn) and eight non-essential metals (As, Ba, Cd, Cs, Hg, Pb, Sn, and Sr) in early childhood blood samples. Trained research assistants administered cognitive tests assessing vocabulary, visual-motor ability, memory, and general intelligence (standard deviations:  approximately 10 points), in early and mid-childhood. We employed multivariable linear regression to examine associations of individual metals with test scores adjusting for confounders, other concurrently measured metals, and first-trimester maternal blood metals. We also estimated joint associations and explored interaction between metals in mixture analyses. RESULTS: We analyzed 349 children (median whole blood Pb  approximately 1 mug/dL). In cross-sectional analyses, each doubling of Pb was associated with lower visual-motor function (mean difference: -2.43 points, 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.01, -0.86) and receptive vocabulary, i.e., words understood (-1.45 points, 95% CI: -3.26, 0.36). Associations of Pb with mid-childhood cognition were weaker and less precise by comparison. Mg was positively associated with cognition in cross-sectional but not prospective analyses, and cross-sectional associations were attenuated in a sensitivity analysis removing adjustment for concurrent metals. We did not observe joint associations nor interactions. DISCUSSION: In this cohort with low blood Pb levels, increased blood Pb was robustly associated with lower cognitive ability in cross-sectional analyses, even after adjustment for prenatal Pb exposure, and regardless of adjustment for metal co-exposures. However, associations with mid-childhood cognition were attenuated and imprecise, suggesting some buffering of Pb neurotoxicity in early life. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Relatively few studies have comprehensively separated the effects of neurotoxic metals such as lead (Pb) from pre- and postnatal co-occurring metals, nor examined persistence of associations across childhood. In a cohort of middle-class children, we found higher early childhood ( approximately 3 y) blood Pb was associated with lower scores on cognitive tests, independent of other metals and prenatal blood Pb. However, early childhood Pb was only weakly associated with cognition in mid-childhood ( approximately 8 y). Our results suggest the effects of low-level Pb exposure may attenuate over time in some populations, implying the presence of factors that may buffer Pb neurotoxicity in early life.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis with a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Current genotype-phenotype paradigms are insufficient to accurately predict JEB subtype and characteristics from genotype, particularly for splice site mutations, which account for over a fifth of disease-causing mutations in JEB. This study evaluated genetic and clinical findings from a JEB cohort, investigating genotype-phenotype correlations through bioinformatic analyses and comparison with previously reported mutations. Eighteen unique mutations in LAMB3, LAMA3, LAMC2 or COL17A1 were identified from seventeen individuals. Seven had severe JEB, nine intermediate JEB and one laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome. Seven mutations were previously unreported. Deep phenotyping was completed for all intermediate JEB cases and demonstrated substantial variation between individuals. Splice site mutations underwent analysis with SpliceAI, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tool, in order to predict resultant transcripts. Predicted functional effects included exon skipping and cryptic splice site activation, which provided potential explanations for disease severity and in most cases correlated with lamimin-332 immunofluorescence. RT-PCR was performed for one case to investigate resultant transcripts produced from the splice site mutation. This study expands the JEB genomic and phenotypic landscape. AI tools show potential for predicting functional effects of splice site mutations and may identify candidates for confirmatory laboratory investigation. Investigation of RNA transcripts will help to further elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations for novel mutations.

Title: A new perspective in radon risk assessment: Mapping the geological hazard as a first step to define the collective radon risk exposure.
Author: ['Bena E', 'Ciotoli G', 'Petermann E', 'Bossew P', 'Ruggiero L', 'Verdi L', 'Huber P', 'Mori F', 'Mazzoli C', 'Sassi R']
Journal Title: The Science of the total environment
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: Radon is a radioactive gas and a major source of ionizing radiation exposure for humans. Consequently, it can pose serious health threats when it accumulates in confined environments. In Europe, recent legislation has been adopted to address radon exposure in dwellings; this law establishes national reference levels and guidelines for defining Radon Priority Areas (RPAs). This study focuses on mapping the Geogenic Radon Potential (GRP) as a foundation for identifying RPAs and, consequently, assessing radon risk in indoor environments. Here, GRP is proposed as a hazard indicator, indicating the potential for radon to enter buildings from geological sources. Various approaches, including multivariate geospatial analysis and the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, have been utilised to generate continuous spatial maps of GRP based on point measurements. In this study, we employed a robust multivariate machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to create the GRP map of the central sector of the Pusteria Valley, incorporating other variables from census tracts such as land use as a vulnerability factor, and population as an exposure factor to create the risk map. The Pusteria Valley in northern Italy was chosen as the pilot site due to its well-known geological, structural, and geochemical features. The results indicate that high Rn risk areas are associated with high GRP values, as well as residential areas and high population density. Starting with the GRP map (e.g., Rn hazard), a new geological-based definition of the RPAs is proposed as fundamental tool for mapping Collective Radon Risk Areas in line with the main objective of European regulations, which is to differentiate them from Individual Risk Areas.

Abstract: In recent decades, there have been significant advances in the diagnosis of diffuse gliomas, driven by the integration of novel technologies. These advancements have deepened our understanding of tumor oncogenesis, enabling a more refined stratification of the biological behavior of these neoplasms. This progress culminated in the fifth edition of the WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in 2021. This comprehensive review article aims to elucidate these advances within a multidisciplinary framework, contextualized within the backdrop of the new classification. This article will explore morphologic pathology and molecular/genetics techniques (immunohistochemistry, genetic sequencing, and methylation profiling), which are pivotal in diagnosis, besides the correlation of structural neuroimaging radiophenotypes to pathology and genetics. It briefly reviews the usefulness of tractography and functional neuroimaging in surgical planning. Additionally, the article addresses the value of other functional imaging techniques such as perfusion MRI, spectroscopy, and nuclear medicine in distinguishing tumor progression from treatment-related changes. Furthermore, it discusses the advantages of evolving diagnostic techniques in classifying these tumors, as well as their limitations in terms of availability and utilization. Moreover, the expanding domains of data processing, artificial intelligence, radiomics, and radiogenomics hold great promise and may soon exert a substantial influence on glioma diagnosis. These innovative technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to these tumors. Ultimately, this review underscores the fundamental importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in employing recent diagnostic advancements, thereby hoping to translate them into improved quality of life and extended survival for glioma patients.

Abstract: Radioactive particle tracking is a nuclear technique that tracks a sealed radioactive particle inside a volume through a mathematical location algorithm, which is widely applied in many fields such as chemical and civil engineering in hydrodynamics flows. It is possible to reconstruct the trajectory of the radioactive particle using a traditional mathematical algorithm or artificial intelligence methods. In this paper, the traditional algorithm is based on solving a minimization problem between the simulated events and a calibration dataset, and it was written using C++ language. The artificial intelligence method is represented by a deep neural network, in which hyperparameters were defined using a Python optimization library called Optuna. This paper aims to compare the potentiality of both methods to evaluate the accuracy of the radioactive particle tracking technique. This study proposes a simplified model of a concrete mixer, six NaI(Tl) detectors, and a(137)Cs sealed radioactive particle. The simulated measurement geometry and the dataset (3615 patterns) were developed using the MCNPX code, which is a mathematical code based on the Monte Carlo Method. The results show a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 20.81%, 10.33%, and 16.84% for x, y and z coordinates, respectively, for the traditional algorithm. For the deep neural network, MAPE is 6.87%, 2.70%, and 22.79% respectively for x, y and z coordinates. In addition, an investigation is carried out to analyze whether the size of the calibration dataset influences the performance of both methods.
