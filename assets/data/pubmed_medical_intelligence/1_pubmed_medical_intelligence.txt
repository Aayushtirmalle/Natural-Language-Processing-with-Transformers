Title: Adaptive DBSCAN Clustering and GASA Optimization for Underdetermined Mixing Matrix Estimation in Fault Diagnosis of Reciprocating Compressors.
Author: ['Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhao H', 'Wang C', 'Shao Q']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: Underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its ability to separate source signals without prior knowledge, even when sensors are limited. To accurately estimate the mixed matrix, various clustering algorithms are typically employed to enhance the sparsity of the mixed matrix. Traditional clustering methods require prior knowledge of the number of direct signal sources, while modern artificial intelligence optimization algorithms are sensitive to outliers, which can affect accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called the Genetic Simulated Annealing Optimization (GASA) method with Adaptive Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering as initialization, named the CYYM method. This approach incorporates two key components: an Adaptive DBSCAN to discard noise points and identify the number of source signals and GASA optimization for automatic cluster center determination. GASA combines the global spatial search capabilities of a genetic algorithm (GA) with the local search abilities of a simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Signal simulations and experimental analysis of compressor fault signals demonstrate that the CYYM method can accurately calculate the mixing matrix, facilitating successful source signal recovery. Subsequently, we analyze the recovered signals using the Refined Composite Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (RCMFE), which, in turn, enables effective compressor connecting rod fault diagnosis. This research provides a promising approach for underdetermined source separation and offers practical applications in fault diagnosis and other fields.

Title: Towards Personalised Mood Prediction and Explanation for Depression from Biophysical Data.
Author: ['Chatterjee S', 'Mishra J', 'Sundram F', 'Roop P']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: Digital health applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a promising opportunity to address the widening gap between available resources and mental health needs globally. Increasingly, passively acquired data from wearables are augmented with carefully selected active data from depressed individuals to develop Machine Learning (ML) models of depression based on mood scores. However, most ML models are black box in nature, and hence the outputs are not explainable. Depression is also multimodal, and the reasons for depression may vary significantly between individuals. Explainable and personalised models will thus be beneficial to clinicians to determine the main features that lead to a decline in the mood state of a depressed individual, thus enabling suitable personalised therapy. This is currently lacking. Therefore, this study presents a methodology for developing personalised and accurate Deep Learning (DL)-based predictive mood models for depression, along with novel methods for identifying the key facets that lead to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. We illustrate our approach by using an existing multimodal dataset containing longitudinal Ecological Momentary Assessments of depression, lifestyle data from wearables and neurocognitive assessments for 14 mild to moderately depressed participants over one month. We develop classification- and regression-based DL models to predict participants' current mood scores-a discrete score given to a participant based on the severity of their depressive symptoms. The models are trained inside eight different evolutionary-algorithm-based optimisation schemes that optimise the model parameters for a maximum predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation scheme is used to verify the DL model's predictive performance against 10 classical ML-based models, with a model error as low as 6% for some participants. We use the best model from the optimisation process to extract indicators, using SHAP, ALE and Anchors from explainable AI literature to explain why certain predictions are made and how they affect mood. These feature insights can assist health professionals in incorporating personalised interventions into a depressed individual's treatment regimen.

Title: A Synthetic Time-Series Generation Using a Variational Recurrent Autoencoder with an Attention Mechanism in an Industrial Control System.
Author: ['Jeon S', 'Seo JT']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 26
Abstract: Data scarcity is a significant obstacle for modern data science and artificial intelligence research communities. The fact that abundant data are a key element of a powerful prediction model is well known through various past studies. However, industrial control systems (ICS) are operated in a closed environment due to security and privacy issues, so collected data are generally not disclosed. In this environment, synthetic data generation can be a good alternative. However, ICS datasets have time-series characteristics and include features with short- and long-term temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose the attention-based variational recurrent autoencoder (AVRAE) for generating time-series ICS data. We first extend the evidence lower bound of the variational inference to time-series data. Then, a recurrent neural-network-based autoencoder is designed to take this as the objective. AVRAE employs the attention mechanism to effectively learn the long-term and short-term temporal dependencies ICS data implies. Finally, we present an algorithm for generating synthetic ICS time-series data using learned AVRAE. In a comprehensive evaluation using the ICS dataset HAI and various performance indicators, AVRAE successfully generated visually and statistically plausible synthetic ICS data.

Abstract: There is a significant risk of injury in sports and intense competition due to the demanding physical and psychological requirements. Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) are the most prevalent type of injury among professional soccer players and are the leading cause of missed days in the sport. These injuries stem from a combination of factors, making it challenging to pinpoint the most crucial risk factors and their interactions, let alone find effective prevention strategies. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the potential of tools provided by artificial intelligence (AI). However, current studies primarily concentrate on enhancing the performance of complex machine learning models, often overlooking their explanatory capabilities. Consequently, medical teams have difficulty interpreting these models and are hesitant to trust them fully. In light of this, there is an increasing need for advanced injury detection and prediction models that can aid doctors in diagnosing or detecting injuries earlier and with greater accuracy. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the biomarkers of muscle injuries in professional soccer players through biomechanical analysis, employing several ML algorithms such as decision tree (DT) methods, discriminant methods, logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble methods, boosted and bagged trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and XGBoost. In particular, XGBoost is also used to obtain the most important features. The findings highlight that the variables that most effectively differentiate the groups and could serve as reliable predictors for injury prevention are the maximum muscle strength of the hamstrings and the stiffness of the same muscle. With regard to the 35 techniques employed, a precision of up to 78% was achieved with XGBoost, indicating that by considering scientific evidence, suggestions based on various data sources, and expert opinions, it is possible to attain good precision, thus enhancing the reliability of the results for doctors and trainers. Furthermore, the obtained results strongly align with the existing literature, although further specific studies about this sport are necessary to draw a definitive conclusion.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band will play an important role in enabling sixth generation (6G) envisioned applications. Compared with lower frequency signals, THz waves are severely attenuated by the atmosphere temperature, pressure, and humidity. Thus, designing a THz communication system must take into account how to circumvent or diminish those issues to achieve a sufficient quality of service. Different solutions are being analyzed: intelligent communication environments, ubiquitous artificial intelligence, extensive network automation, and dynamic spectrum access, among others. This survey focuses on the benefits of integrating intelligent surfaces (ISs) and THz communication systems by providing an overview of IS in wireless communications with the scanning of the recent developments, a description of the architecture, and an explanation of the operation. The survey also covers THz channel models, differentiating them based on deterministic and statistical channel modeling. The IS-aided THz channels are elucidated at the end of the survey. Finally, discussions and research directions are given to help enrich the IS field of research and guide the reader through open issues.

Abstract: Endometrial cancer (EC) is intricately linked to obesity and diabetes, which are widespread risk factors. Medical imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a major role in EC assessment, particularly for disease staging. However, the diagnostic performance of MRI exhibits variability in the detection of clinically relevant prognostic factors (e.g., deep myometrial invasion and metastatic lymph nodes assessment). To address these challenges and enhance the value of MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms emerge as promising tools with a potential to impact EC risk assessment, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction. These advanced post-processing techniques allow us to quantitatively analyse medical images, providing novel insights into cancer characteristics beyond conventional qualitative image evaluation. However, despite the growing interest and research efforts, the integration of radiomics and AI to EC management is still far from clinical practice and represents a possible perspective rather than an actual reality. This review focuses on the state of radiomics and AI in EC MRI, emphasizing risk stratification and prognostic factor prediction, aiming to illuminate potential advancements and address existing challenges in the field.

Abstract: Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease that can cause physical injury and mental disability. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but can be inconclusive due to the absence of initial symptoms and similarity to other dermatological diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used in dermatology, assisting clinical procedures and diagnostics. In particular, AI-supported solutions have been proposed in the literature to aid in the diagnosis of leprosy, and this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to characterize the state of the art. This SLR followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework and was conducted in the following databases: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Digital Library, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Potentially relevant research articles were retrieved. The researchers applied criteria to select the studies, assess their quality, and perform the data extraction process. Moreover, 1659 studies were retrieved, of which 21 were included in the review after selection. Most of the studies used images of skin lesions, classical machine learning algorithms, and multi-class classification tasks to develop models to diagnose dermatological diseases. Most of the reviewed articles did not target leprosy as the study's primary objective but rather the classification of different skin diseases (among them, leprosy). Although AI-supported leprosy diagnosis is constantly evolving, research in this area is still in its early stage, then studies are required to make AI solutions mature enough to be transformed into clinical practice. Expanding research efforts on leprosy diagnosis, coupled with the advocacy of open science in leveraging AI for diagnostic support, can yield robust and influential outcomes.

Title: An Artificial Intelligence System for Optimizing Radioactive Iodine Therapy Dosimetry.
Author: ['Georgiou MF', 'Nielsen JA', 'Chiriboga R', 'Kuker RA']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: Thyroid cancer, specifically differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), is one of the most prevalent endocrine malignancies worldwide. Radioactive iodine therapy (RAIT) using I-131 has been a standard-of-care approach for DTC due to its ability to ablate remnant thyroid disease following surgery, thus reducing the risk of recurrence. It is also used for the treatment of iodine-avid metastases. RAIT dosimetry can be employed to determine the optimal treatment dose of I-131 to effectively treat cancer cells while safeguarding against undesirable radiation effects such as bone marrow toxicity or radiation pneumonitis. Conventional dosimetry protocols for RAIT, however, are complex and time-consuming, involving multiple days of imaging and blood sampling. This study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simplifying and optimizing RAIT. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 83 adult patients with DTC who underwent RAIT dosimetry at our institution between 1996 and 2023. The conventional MIRD-based dosimetry protocol involved imaging and blood sampling at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-administration of a tracer activity of I-131. An AI system based on a deep-learning neural network was developed to predict the maximum permissible activity (MPA) for RAIT using only the data obtained from the initial 4, 24, and 48 h time points. The AI system predicted the MPA values with high accuracy, showing no significant difference compared to the results obtained from conventional MIRD-based analysis utilizing a paired t-test (p = 0.351, 95% CI). The developed AI system offers the potential to streamline the dosimetry process, reducing the number of imaging and blood sampling sessions while also optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, the AI approach can uncover underlying relationships in data that were previously unknown. Our findings suggest that AI-based dosimetry may be a promising method for patient-specific treatment planning in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, representing a step towards applying precision medicine for thyroid cancer. Further validation and implementation studies are warranted to assess the clinical applicability of the AI system.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrythmia and one of the strongest risk factors and causal mechanisms of ischemic stroke (IS). Acute IS due to AF tends to be more severe than with other etiology of IS and patients with treated AF have reported to experience worse outcomes after endovascular treatment compared with patients without AF. As cardioembolism accounts for more than a fifth of ISs and the risk of future stroke can be mitigated with effective anticoagulation, which has been shown to be effective and safe in patients with paroxysmal or sustained AF, the screening of patients with cryptogenic IS (CIS) for AF is paramount. Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) is a subtype of CIS with a high likelihood of cardioembolism. The European Stroke Organization and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend at least 72 h of screening when AF is suspected. The longer the screening and the earlier the time point after acute IS, the more likely the AF paroxysm is found. Several methods are available for short-term screening of AF, including in-hospital monitoring and wearable electrocardiogram recorders for home monitoring. Implantable loop monitors provide an effective long-term method to screen patients with high risk of AF after IS and artificial intelligence and convolutional neural networks may enhance the efficacy of AF screening in the future. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists in both primary and secondary prevention of IS in AF patients. Recent data from the randomized controlled trials (RCT) also suggest that early initiation of DOAC treatment after acute IS is safe compared to later initiation. Anticoagulation treatment may still predispose for intracranial bleeding, particularly among patients with prior cerebrovascular events. Left atrial appendix closure offers an optional treatment choice for patients with prior intracranial hemorrhage and may offer an alternative to oral anticoagulation even for patients with IS, but these indications await validation in ongoing RCTs. There are still controversies related to the association of found AF paroxysms in CIS patients with prolonged screening, pertaining to the optimal duration of screening and screening strategies with prolonged monitoring techniques in patients with ESUS. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of epidemiology, screening, and prognosis in AF patients with stroke.

Abstract: Access to medical imaging is pivotal in healthcare, playing a crucial role in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of diseases. However, disparities persist in this scenario, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals facing linguistic or cultural barriers. This paper critically assesses methods to mitigate these disparities, with a focus on breast cancer screening. We underscore scientific mobility as a vital tool for radiologists to advocate for healthcare policy changes: it not only enhances diversity and cultural competence within the radiology community but also fosters international cooperation and knowledge exchange among healthcare institutions. Efforts to ensure cultural competency among radiologists are discussed, including ongoing cultural education, sensitivity training, and workforce diversification. These initiatives are key to improving patient communication and reducing healthcare disparities. This paper also highlights the crucial role of policy changes and legislation in promoting equal access to essential screening services like mammography. We explore the challenges and potential of teleradiology in improving access to medical imaging in remote and underserved areas. In the era of artificial intelligence, this paper emphasizes the necessity of validating its models across a spectrum of populations to prevent bias and achieve equitable healthcare outcomes. Finally, the importance of international collaboration is illustrated, showcasing its role in sharing insights and strategies to overcome global access barriers in medical imaging. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the challenges related to disparities in medical imaging access and proposes actionable strategies to address these challenges, aiming for equitable healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Mismatch repair deficiency (d-MMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS, and BRAF mutational status are crucial for treating advanced colorectal cancer patients. Traditional methods like immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be challenged by artificial intelligence (AI) based on whole slide images (WSI) to predict tumor status. In this systematic review, we evaluated the role of AI in predicting MSI status, KRAS, and BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer. Studies published in PubMed up to June 2023 were included (n = 17), and we reported the risk of bias and the performance for each study. Some studies were impacted by the reduced number of slides included in the data set and the lack of external validation cohorts. Deep learning models for the d-MMR/MSI status showed a good performance in training cohorts (mean AUC = 0.89, [0.74-0.97]) but slightly less than expected in the validation cohort when available (mean AUC = 0.82, [0.63-0.98]). Contrary to the MSI status, the prediction of KRAS and BRAF mutations was less explored with a less robust methodology. The performance was lower, with a maximum of 0.77 in the training cohort, 0.58 in the validation cohort for KRAS, and 0.82 AUC in the training cohort for BRAF.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 30
Abstract: This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of two artificial intelligence (AI) techniques: Kakao Brain Artificial Neural Network for Chest X-ray Reading (KARA-CXR), an assistive technology developed using large-scale AI and large language models (LLMs), and ChatGPT, a well-known LLM. The study was conducted to validate the performance of the two technologies in chest X-ray reading and explore their potential applications in the medical imaging diagnosis domain. The study methodology consisted of randomly selecting 2000 chest X-ray images from a single institution's patient database, and two radiologists evaluated the readings provided by KARA-CXR and ChatGPT. The study used five qualitative factors to evaluate the readings generated by each model: accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. Statistical analysis showed that KARA-CXR achieved significantly higher diagnostic accuracy compared to ChatGPT. In the 'Acceptable' accuracy category, KARA-CXR was rated at 70.50% and 68.00% by two observers, while ChatGPT achieved 40.50% and 47.00%. Interobserver agreement was moderate for both systems, with KARA at 0.74 and GPT4 at 0.73. For 'False Findings', KARA-CXR scored 68.00% and 68.50%, while ChatGPT scored 37.00% for both observers, with high interobserver agreements of 0.96 for KARA and 0.97 for GPT4. In 'Location Inaccuracy' and 'Hallucinations', KARA-CXR outperformed ChatGPT with significant margins. KARA-CXR demonstrated a non-hallucination rate of 75%, which is significantly higher than ChatGPT's 38%. The interobserver agreement was high for KARA (0.91) and moderate to high for GPT4 (0.85) in the hallucination category. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of AI and large-scale language models in medical imaging and diagnostics. It also shows that in the chest X-ray domain, KARA-CXR has relatively higher accuracy than ChatGPT.

Title: Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound in Diagnosis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
Author: ['Chatterjee A', 'Shah J']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common (90%) type of solid pancreatic neoplasm. Due to its late presentation and poor survival rate, early diagnosis and timely treatment is of utmost importance for better clinical outcomes. Endoscopic ultrasound provides high-resolution images of the pancreas and has excellent sensitivity in the diagnosis of even small (<2 cm) pancreatic lesions. Apart from imaging, it also has an advantage of tissue acquisition (EUS fine-needle aspiration, FNA; or fine-needle biopsy, FNB) for definitive diagnoses. EUS-guided tissue acquisition plays a crucial role in genomic and molecular studies, which in today's era of personalized medicine, are likely to become important components of PDAC management. With the use of better needle designs and technical advancements, EUS has now become an indispensable tool in the management of PDAC. Lastly, artificial intelligence for the detection of pancreatic lesions and newer automated needles for tissue acquisition will obviate observer dependency in the near future, resulting in the wider dissemination and adoption of this technology for improved outcomes in patients with PDAC.

Abstract: (1) Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing challenge, both for patients and physicians, in order to control the impact on health and prevent complications. Millions of patients with diabetes require medical attention, which generates problems regarding the limited time for screening but also addressability difficulties for consultation and management. As a result, screening programs for vision-threatening complications due to DM have to be more efficient in the future in order to cope with such a great healthcare burden. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of DM that can be prevented if it is timely screened with the help of optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices. Newly developing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can assist physicians in analyzing large datasets and flag potential risks. By using AI algorithms in order to process OCT images of large populations, the screening capacity and speed can be increased so that patients can be timely treated. This quick response gives the physicians a chance to intervene and prevent disability. (2) Methods: This study evaluated ConvNeXt and EfficientNet architectures in correctly identifying DME patterns on real-life OCT images for screening purposes. (3) Results: Firstly, we obtained models that differentiate between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and healthy scans with an accuracy of 0.98. Secondly, we obtained a model that can indicate the presence of edema, detachment of the subfoveolar neurosensory retina, and hyperreflective foci (HF) without using pixel level annotation. Lastly, we analyzed the extent to which the pretrained weights on natural images "understand" OCT scans. (4) Conclusions: Pretrained networks such as ConvNeXt or EfficientNet correctly identify features relevant to the differentiation between healthy retinas and DR, even though they were pretrained on natural images. Another important aspect of our research is that the differentiation between biomarkers and their localization can be obtained even without pixel-level annotation. The "three biomarkers model" is able to identify obvious subfoveal neurosensory detachments, retinal edema, and hyperreflective foci, as well as very small subfoveal detachments. In conclusion, our study points out the possible usefulness of AI-assisted diagnosis of DME for lowering healthcare costs, increasing the quality of life of patients with diabetes, and reducing the waiting time until an appropriate ophthalmological consultation and treatment can be performed.

Abstract: DUS measurements for popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) specifically can be time-consuming, error-prone, and operator-dependent. To eliminate this subjectivity and provide efficient segmentation, we applied artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately delineate inner and outer lumen on DUS. DUS images were selected from a cohort of patients with PAAs from a multi-institutional platform. Encord is an easy-to-use, readily available online AI platform that was used to segment both the inner lumen and outer lumen of the PAA on DUS images. A model trained on 20 images and tested on 80 images had a mean Average Precision of 0.85 for the outer polygon and 0.23 for the inner polygon. The outer polygon had a higher recall score than precision score at 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. The inner polygon had a score of 0.25 for both precision and recall. The outer polygon false-negative rate was the lowest in images with the least amount of blur. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the widely available Encord AI platform to identify standard features of PAAs that are critical for operative decision making.

Journal Title: Foods (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: On a global scale, food safety and security aspects entail consideration throughout the farm-to-fork continuum, considering food's supply chain. Generally, the agrifood system is a multiplex network of interconnected features and processes, with a hard predictive rate, where maintaining the food's safety is an indispensable element and is part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has led the scientific community to develop advanced applied analytical methods, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques applied for assessing foodborne diseases. The main objective of this paper is to contribute to the development of the consensus version of ongoing research about the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the domain of food-crop safety from an analytical point of view. Writing a comprehensive review for a more specific topic can also be challenging, especially when searching within the literature. To our knowledge, this review is the first to address this issue. This work consisted of conducting a unique and exhaustive study of the literature, using our TriScope Keywords-based Synthesis methodology. All available literature related to our topic was investigated according to our criteria of inclusion and exclusion. The final count of data papers was subject to deep reading and analysis to extract the necessary information to answer our research questions. Although many studies have been conducted, limited attention has been paid to outlining the applications of AI tools combined with analytical strategies for crop-based food safety specifically.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Caring behavior is a major focus of the nursing profession and an important dimension of nursing practice that sets nurses apart from other healthcare professionals. Effective patient-centered care requires ensuring nurses have the emotional intelligence and happiness to address the daily demands of practice. The purpose of this study is to examine the emotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students and their relationship with caring behaviors. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study was conducted on nursing students (n = 363) from Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, via an online survey. Measures include demographic data survey, Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, and Caring Behaviors Inventory scale. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted for this study. RESULTS: Nursing students reported their highest degree of caring was in terms of 'respectful differences to others', while their lowest was in 'knowledge and skills'. Emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and explained the variance in assurance of human presence (17.5%), knowledge and skills (17.5%), respectful differences to others (18%), and positive connectedness (12.9%). In the final regression model, emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and explained 19.5% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students were found to be important factors to improve their caregiving behaviors. Therefore, nursing educators should consider integrating emotional intelligence and happiness interventions for students into their curriculum.

Abstract: One of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence is automated scientific discovery based on previously amassed data, coupled with restrictions provided by known physical principles, including symmetries and conservation laws. Such automated hypothesis creation and verification can assist scientists in studying complex phenomena, where traditional physical intuition may fail. Here we develop a platform based on a generalized Onsager principle to learn macroscopic dynamical descriptions of arbitrary stochastic dissipative systems directly from observations of their microscopic trajectories. Our method simultaneously constructs reduced thermodynamic coordinates and interprets the dynamics on these coordinates. We demonstrate its effectiveness by studying theoretically and validating experimentally the stretching of long polymer chains in an externally applied field. Specifically, we learn three interpretable thermodynamic coordinates and build a dynamical landscape of polymer stretching, including the identification of stable and transition states and the control of the stretching rate. Our general methodology can be used to address a wide range of scientific and technological applications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental noise is increasing in recent years but most of the previous literature in children has evaluated the effect of aircraft noise exposure at schools on cognition. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether residential exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy and childhood is associated with cognitive and motor function in children and preadolescents. METHODS: The study involved 619 participants from the Spanish INMA-Sabadell cohort and 7,115 from the Dutch Generation R Study. We used noise maps to estimate the average day-evening-night road traffic noise levels at each participant's residential address during pregnancy and childhood periods. Validated tests were administered throughout childhood in both cohorts to assess non-verbal and verbal intelligence, memory, processing speed, attentional function, working memory, cognitive flexibility, risky decision-making, and fine and gross motor function. Linear models, linear mixed models, and negative binomial models were run depending on the outcome in cohort-specific analysis and combined with a random-effects meta-analysis. All models were adjusted for several socioeconomic and lifestyle variables and results corrected for multiple testing. RESULTS: Average road traffic noise exposure levels during pregnancy and childhood were 61.3 (SD 6.0) and 61.5 (SD 5.4) dB for the INMA-Sabadell cohort and 54.6 (SD 7.9) and 53.5 (SD 6.5) dB for the Generation R Study, respectively. Road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy and childhood was not related to any of the cognitive and motor function outcomes examined in this study (e.g. -0.92 (95 % CI -2.08; 0.24) and 0.20 (95 % CI -0.96; 1.35) in overall estimates of memory and fine motor function, respectively, when road traffic noise increases by 10 dB during childhood). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that child's cognitive or motor functions are not affected by residential exposure to road traffic noise. However, more studies evaluating this association at school and home settings as well as noise events are needed.
