Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effect of acupuncture at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen (benefiting the intelligence and regulating the spirit) on the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the whole brain in the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and reveal the brain function mechanism of acupuncture in treatment of AD using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). METHODS: Sixty patients with mild to moderate AD were randomly divided into an acupuncture + medication group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped out) and a western medication group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped out). In the western medication group, the donepezil hydrochloride tablets were administered orally, 2.5 mg to 5 mg each time, once daily; and adjusted to be 10 mg each time after 4 weeks of medication. Besides the therapy as the western medication group, in the acupuncture + medication group, acupuncture was supplemented at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen, i.e. Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), and bilateral Shenmen (HT 7), Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Xuanzhong (GB 39). The needles were retained for 30 min in one treatment, once daily; and 6 treatments were required weekly. The duration of treatment was 6 weeks in each group. The general cognitive function was assessed by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive part (ADAS-Cog) before and after treatment in the two groups. Using the rs-fMRI, the changes in the functional connectivity (FC) of the left hippocampus and the whole brain before and after treatment were analyzed in the patients of the two groups (11 cases in the acupuncture + medication group and 12 cases in the western medication group). RESULTS: After treatment, compared with those before treatment, MMSE scores increased and ADAS-Cog scores decreased in the two groups (P<0.05); MMSE score was higher, while the ADAS-Cog score was lower in the acupuncture + medication group when compared with those in the western medication group (P</=0.05). After treatment, in the western medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was enhanced with the left fusiform gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus of the left triangular region, the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and the right superior parietal gyrus (P<0.05), while FC was weakened with the left inferior temporal gyrus, the left middle frontal gyrus and the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus when compared with that before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, in the acupuncture + medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was increased with the right gyrus rectus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the right superior temporal gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (P<0.05), and it was declined with the left thalamus (P<0.05) when compared with those before treatment. After treatment, in the acupuncture + medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was strengthened with the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, the right gyrus rectus, the bilateral superior occipital gyrus, the left lenticular nucleus putamen, the left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus of the left insulae operculum, the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the right posterior central gyrus (P<0.05) compared with that of the western medication group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen improves the cognitive function of AD patients, and its main brain functional mechanism is related to intensifying the functional connectivity of the left hippocampus with the default network (inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus), as well as with the sensory (posterior central gyrus) and visual (calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex and superior occipital gyrus) brain regions.

Title: Cytogenetics and genomics in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
Author: ['Antic Z', 'Lentes J', 'Bergmann AK']
Journal Title: Best practice & research. Clinical haematology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: The last five decades have witnessed significant improvement in diagnostics, treatment and management of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These advancements have become possible through progress in our understanding of the genetic and biological background of ALL, resulting in the introduction of risk-adapted treatment and novel therapeutic targets, e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors for BCR::ABL1-positive ALL. Further advances in the taxonomy of ALL and the discovery of new genetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, as well as the introduction of targeted and immunotherapies into the frontline treatment protocols, may improve management and outcome of children with ALL. In this review we describe the current developments in the (cyto)genetic diagnostics and management of children with ALL, and provide an overview of the most important advances in the genetic classification of ALL. Furthermore, we discuss perspectives resulting from the development of new techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability, agreement with provider measurement, and patient preferences regarding patient self-measurement of postvoid residual bladder volume (PVR). PVR measurement in the nonhealthcare setting is a valuable opportunity for remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients. We hypothesized that patient self-measurement of PVR using a smart-device portable ultrasound system with artificial intelligence would demonstrate high reliability, strong agreement with provider measurement, and be preferred over provider measurements. METHODS: Patients were enrolled during outpatient Urology visits. PVRs were measured in triplicate by providers using each of the following: an FDA-cleared (standard) bladder scanner, the portable ultrasound probe using ultrasound images (Butterfly US image mode), and the portable ultrasound probe using abstract images (Butterfly abstract mode). Subjects self-measured PVRs in triplicate using both imaging modes and reported their experiences via questionnaire. Reliability was assessed via intraclass correlation. Agreement between methods was assessed via Bland-Altman analyses using a clinically acceptable difference threshold of 50 mL. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 for each method. 95% limits of agreement between standard bladder scanner and patient self-measurement were - 71.73 mL and 86.73 mL using Butterfly US image mode and - 93.84 mL and 112.52 mL using Butterfly abstract mode, respectively. Most patients preferred self-measurement over provider measurement (74% vs 26%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patient self-measurement of PVR using smart-device integrated portable ultrasound probes is feasible, reliable, and preferred by patients. Limits of agreement between patient self-measurement and standard bladder scanner measurements exceeded our clinically acceptable difference threshold, though the inherent error of ultrasound-based bladder volume measurements should be considered. Longitudinal PVR assessments in nonhealthcare settings may facilitate remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients.

Journal Title: The Canadian journal of cardiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The burden of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is greater than that of heart failure; however, a cost-effective tool for asymptomatic LVD screening has not been well validated. We aimed to prospectively validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm for asymptomatic LVD detection and evaluate its cost-effectiveness for opportunistic screening. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, patients undergoing ECG at outpatient clinics or health check-ups were enrolled in two hospitals in Taiwan. Patients were stratified into LVD (LVEF <= 40%) risk groups using a previously developed ECG algorithm. The performance of AI-ECG was used to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of LVD screening compared with no screening. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and sensitivity analyses were employed to examine the cost-effectiveness and robustness of the results. RESULTS: Among the 29,137 patients, the algorithm demonstrated area-under-the-curves of 0.984 and 0.945 for detecting LVD within 28 days in the two hospital cohorts. For patients not initially scheduled for an echocardiogram, the algorithm predicted future echocardiograms (high-risk, 46.2%; medium-risk, 31.4%; low-risk, 14.6%) and LVD at 12 months (high-risk, 26.2%; medium-risk, 3.4%; low-risk, 0.1%). Opportunistic screening with AI-ECG could result in a negative ICER of -$7,439 for patients aged 65, with consistent cost-savings across age groups and particularly in men. Approximately 91.5% of the cases were found to be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay of $30,000 in the probabilistic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AI-ECG for asymptomatic LVD risk stratification is promising, and opportunistic screening in outpatient clinics has the potential to save costs.

Title: Applying artificial intelligence and computational modeling to nanomedicine.
Author: ['Hamilton S', 'Kingston BR']
Journal Title: Current opinion in biotechnology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: Achieving specific and targeted delivery of nanomedicines to diseased tissues is a major challenge. This is because the process of designing, formulating, testing, and selecting a nanoparticle delivery vehicle for a specific disease target is governed by complex multivariate interactions. Computational modeling and artificial intelligence are well-suited for analyzing and modeling large multivariate datasets in short periods of time. Computational approaches can be applied to help design nanomedicine formulations, interpret nanoparticle-biological interactions, and create models from high-throughput screening techniques to improve the selection of the ideal nanoparticle carrier. In the future, many steps in the nanomedicine development process will be done computationally, reducing the number of experiments and time needed to select the ideal nanomedicine formulation.

Journal Title: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 2
Abstract: BACKGROUND: In Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), several methodologies are emerging to derive novel biomarkers to be incorporated in the risk assessment. We realized a pipeline that relies on autoencoders (AE) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to stratify prognosis and derive a gene-based signature. METHODS: AE was exploited to learn an unsupervised representation of the gene expression (GE) from three publicly available datasets, each with its own technology. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was used to classify prognosis from latent representation. GE data were preprocessed as normalized, scaled, and standardized. Four different AE architectures (Large, Medium, Small and Extra Small) were compared to find the most suitable for GE data. The joint AE-MLP classified patients on six different outcomes: overall survival at 12, 36, 60 months and progression-free survival (PFS) at 12, 36, 60 months. XAI techniques were used to derive a gene-based signature aimed at refining the Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI) risk, which was validated in a fourth independent publicly available dataset. We named our tool SurvIAE: Survival prediction with Interpretable AE. RESULTS: From the latent space of AEs, we observed that scaled and standardized data reduced the batch effect. SurvIAE models outperformed R-IPI with Matthews Correlation Coefficient up to 0.42 vs. 0.18 for the validation-set (PFS36) and to 0.30 vs. 0.19 for the test-set (PFS60). We selected the SurvIAE-Small-PFS36 as the best model and, from its gene signature, we stratified patients in three risk groups: R-IPI Poor patients with High levels of GAB1, R-IPI Poor patients with Low levels of GAB1 or R-IPI Good/Very Good patients with Low levels of GPR132, and R-IPI Good/Very Good patients with High levels of GPR132. CONCLUSIONS: SurvIAE showed the potential to derive a gene signature with translational purpose in DLBCL. The pipeline was made publicly available and can be reused for other pathologies.

Author: ['Aziz D', 'Maganti K', 'Yanamala N', 'Sengupta P']
Journal Title: Current cardiology reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In echocardiography, there has been robust development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for image recognition, automated measurements, image segmentation, and patient prognostication that has created a monumental shift in the study of AI and machine learning models. However, integrating these measurements into complex disease recognition and therapeutic interventions remains challenging. While the tools have been developed, there is a lack of evidence regarding implementing heterogeneous systems for guiding clinical decision-making and therapeutic action. RECENT FINDINGS: Newer AI modalities have shown concrete positive data in terms of user-guided image acquisition and processing, precise determination of both basic and advanced quantitative echocardiographic features, and the potential to construct predictive models, all with the possibility of seamless integration into clinical decision support systems. AI in echocardiography is a powerful and ever-growing tool with the potential for revolutionary effects on the practice of cardiology. In this review article, we explore the growth of AI and its applications in echocardiography, along with clinical implications and the associated regulatory, legal, and ethical considerations.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The assessment of the knee alignment on long leg radiographs (LLR) postoperative to corrective knee osteotomies (CKOs) is highly dependent on the reader's expertise. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms may help automate and standardise this process. The study aimed to analyse the reliability of an AI-algorithm for the evaluation of LLRs following CKOs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analysed a validation cohort of 110 postoperative LLRs from 102 patients. All patients underwent CKO, including distal femoral (DFO), high tibial (HTO) and bilevel osteotomies. The agreement between manual measurements and the AI-algorithm was assessed for the mechanical axis deviation (MAD), hip knee ankle angle (HKA), anatomical-mechanical-axis-angle (AMA), joint line convergence angle (JLCA), mechanical lateral proximal femur angle (mLPFA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibia angle (mMPTA) and mechanical lateral distal tibia angle (mLDTA), using the intra-class-correlation (ICC) coefficient between the readers, each reader and the AI and the mean of the manual reads and the AI-algorithm and Bland-Altman Plots between the manual reads and the AI software for the MAD, HKA, mLDFA and mMPTA. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, the AI software showed excellent agreement with the manual reads (ICC: 0.81-0.99). The agreement between the readers (Inter-rater) showed excellent correlations (ICC: 0.95-0. The mean difference in the DFO group for the MAD, HKA, mLDFA and mMPTA were 0.50 mm, - 0.12 degrees , 0.55 degrees  and 0.15 degrees . In the HTO group the mean difference for the MAD, HKA, mLDFA and mMPTA were 0.36 mm, - 0.17 degrees , 0.57 degrees  and 0.08 degrees , respectively. Reliable outputs were generated in 95.4% of the validation cohort. CONCLUSION:  he application of AI-algorithms for the assessment of lower limb alignment on LLRs following CKOs shows reliable and accurate results. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Level III.

Title: DeepTree: Pathological Image Classification through Imitating Tree-like Strategies of Pathologists.
Author: ['Li J', 'Cheng J', 'Meng L', 'Yan H', 'He Y', 'Shi H', 'Guan T', 'Han A']
Journal Title: IEEE transactions on medical imaging
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: Digitization of pathological slides has promoted the research of computer-aided diagnosis, in which artificial intelligence analysis of pathological images deserves attention. Appropriate deep learning techniques in natural images have been extended to computational pathology. Still, they seldom take into account prior knowledge in pathology, especially the analysis process of lesion morphology by pathologists. Inspired by the diagnosis decision of pathologists, we design a novel deep learning architecture based on tree-like strategies called DeepTree. It imitates pathological diagnosis methods, designed as a binary tree structure, to conditionally learn the correlation between tissue morphology, and optimizes branches to finetune the performance further. To validate and benchmark DeepTree, we build a dataset of frozen lung cancer tissues and design experiments on a public dataset of breast tumor subtypes and our dataset. Results show that the deep learning architecture based on tree-like strategies makes the pathological image classification more accurate, transparent, and convincing. Simultaneously, prior knowledge based on diagnostic strategies yields superior representation ability compared to alternative methods. Our proposed methodology helps improve the trust of pathologists in artificial intelligence analysis and promotes the practical clinical application of pathology-assisted diagnosis.

Journal Title: JMIR research protocols
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are still unanswered questions regarding effective educational strategies to promote the transformation and articulation of clinical data while teaching and learning clinical reasoning. Additionally, understanding how this process can be analyzed and assessed is crucial, particularly considering the rapid growth of natural language processing in artificial intelligence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to map educational strategies to promote the transformation and articulation of clinical data among students and health care professionals and to explore the methods used to assess these individuals' transformation and articulation of clinical data. METHODS: This scoping review follows the Joanna Briggs Institute framework for scoping reviews and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for the analysis. A literature search was performed in November 2022 using 5 databases: CINAHL (EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science (Clarivate). The protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework in November 2023. The scoping review will follow the 9-step framework proposed by Peters and colleagues of the Joanna Briggs Institute. A data extraction form has been developed using key themes from the research questions. RESULTS: After removing duplicates, the initial search yielded 6656 results, and study selection is underway. The extracted data will be qualitatively analyzed and presented in a diagrammatic or tabular form alongside a narrative summary. The review will be completed by February 2024. CONCLUSIONS: By synthesizing the evidence on semantic transformation and articulation of clinical data during clinical reasoning education, this review aims to contribute to the refinement of educational strategies and assessment methods used in academic and continuing education programs. The insights gained from this review will help educators develop more effective semantic approaches for teaching or learning clinical reasoning, as opposed to fragmented, purely symptom-based or probabilistic approaches. Besides, the results may suggest some ways to address challenges related to the assessment of clinical reasoning and ensure that the assessment tasks accurately reflect learners' developing competencies and educational progress.

Title: A Mobile Health App for Facilitating Disease Management in Children With Atopic Dermatitis: Feasibility and Impact Study.
Author: ['Zvulunov A', 'Lenevich S', 'Migacheva N']
Journal Title: JMIR dermatology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inadequate control of atopic dermatitis (AD) increases the frequency of exacerbations and reduces the quality of life. Mobile health apps provide information and communication technology and may increase treatment adherence and facilitate disease management at home. The mobile health app, Atopic App, designed for patients and their caregivers, and the associated web-based patient education program, Atopic School, provide an opportunity for improving patients' and caregivers' engagement and adherence to the management of AD. OBJECTIVE: This noninterventional, observational study aimed to explore the feasibility and potential impact on the management of AD in children by caregivers using the Atopic App mobile health app. METHODS: The patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM) and numerical rating scale for the grading of pruritus were used as severity scores (scale range: 0-28). The artificial intelligence model of the app was used to assess the severity of AD based on the eczema area and severity index approach. The deidentified data enabled the analysis of the severity of AD, treatment plan history, potential triggers of flare-ups, usage of available features of the app, and the impact of patient education. RESULTS: During a 12-month period, of the 1223 users who installed the app, 910 (74.4%) registered users were caregivers of children with AD. The web-based Atopic School course was accessed by 266 (29.2%) caregivers of children with AD, 134 (50.4%) of whom completed the course. Usage of the app was significantly more frequent among those who completed the Atopic School program than among those who did not access or did not complete the course (P<.001). Users who completed a second POEM 21 to 27 days apart exhibited a significant improvement of AD severity based on the POEM score (P<.001), with an average improvement of 3.86 (SD 6.85) points. The artificial intelligence severity score and itching score were highly correlated with the POEM score (r=0.35 and r=0.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Atopic App provides valuable real-world data on the epidemiology, severity dynamics, treatment patterns, and exacerbation-trigger correlations in patients with AD. The significant reduction in the POEM score among users of the Atopic App indicates a potential impact of this tool on health care engagement by caregivers of children with AD.

Author: ['Lee S', 'Park G']
Journal Title: Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: The introduction of chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT), the fastest growing large language model, has changed the landscape of artificial intelligence-human interaction in everyday life. As the social influence of ChatGPT increases, competencies in it become important life skills. This study aims to explore the determinants of ChatGPT user satisfaction to provide practical implications by suggesting a significant independent variable and mediators between the independent variable and user satisfaction. To this end, this study recruited 822 college students with prior experience using ChatGPT (407 males and 415 females) and conducted an online survey. We tested the effects of ChatGPT literacy on user satisfaction and the mediating roles of different motives (i.e., information and knowledge acquisition and entertainment and leisure) in the relationship between ChatGPT literacy and user satisfaction. The results suggest that ChatGPT literacy significantly increases user satisfaction and that information and knowledge acquisition and entertainment and leisure partially mediate the relationship between the effect of ChatGPT literacy and user satisfaction. The results may have implications for large language model developers and practitioners, such as educators.

Journal Title: Frontiers in psychiatry
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Few studies on adolescents have investigated intelligence quotient (IQ) in mood disorders. Evidence on Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), a controversial entity among depressive disorders, is more limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an exploratory study on adolescent inpatients with unipolar mood disorders to test specific impairment in cognitive and adaptive profile. We also considered common psychopathological comorbidities. We retrospectively collected data on inpatients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), DMDD or Depressive Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS) evaluated with Wechsler Scales of Intelligence, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-II), and Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). RESULTS: Out of 198 inpatients (85.9% females), 33.3% had MDD, 60.1% DD-NOS and 6.6% DMDD. DMDD patients had higher rates of ADHD (15.4%) and learning disorders (LD, 23.1%), a lower mean IQ (87.8 +/- 10.7; p = 0.001) and ABAS-II scores (general composite 68.8 +/- 16.8; p = 0.002) than other groups. In linear regression analysis, DMDD retained a significant correlation with lower IQ and adaptive abilities when controlling for sex, and comorbidities. Among comorbidities, LD correlated with lower perceptual reasoning and IQ, and ADHD with lower conceptual adaptive abilities. In all diagnosis groups, working memory and processing speed were lower than verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. DISCUSSION: While impairment in working memory and processing speed is a non-specific correlate of active mood disorder, DMDD is burdened by lower general intelligence and adaptive abilities and higher rate of neurodevelopmental comorbidities. Lower IQ in the normal range is a correlate of DMDD among variables examined, not explained by the effect of neurodevelopmental comorbidities. These findings are discussed with regards to possible implications for the consideration of DMDD as a bridge condition between neurodevelopmental disorders and mood disorders.

Abstract: Carbohydrate sequencing is a formidable task identified as a strategic goal in modern biochemistry. It relies on identifying a large number of isomers and their connectivity with high accuracy. Recently, gas phase vibrational laser spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry tools have been proposed as a very promising sequencing approach. However, its use as a generic analytical tool relies on the development of recognition techniques that can analyse complex vibrational fingerprints for a large number of monomers. In this study, we used a Bayesian deep neural network model to automatically identify and classify vibrational fingerprints of several monosaccharides. We report high performances of the obtained trained algorithm (GlAIcomics), that can be used to discriminate contamination and identify a molecule with a high degree of confidence. It opens the possibility to use artificial intelligence in combination with spectroscopy-augmented mass spectrometry for carbohydrates sequencing and glycomics applications.

Journal Title: Frontiers in immunology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Engineering immune cells to treat hematological malignancies has been a major focus of research since the first resounding successes of CAR-T-cell therapies in B-ALL. Several diseases can now be treated in highly therapy-refractory or relapsed conditions. Currently, a number of CD19- or BCMA-specific CAR-T-cell therapies are approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), multiple myeloma (MM), and follicular lymphoma (FL). The implementation of these therapies has significantly improved patient outcome and survival even in cases with previously very poor prognosis. In this comprehensive review, we present the current state of research, recent innovations, and the applications of CAR-T-cell therapy in a selected group of hematologic malignancies. We focus on B- and T-cell malignancies, including the entities of cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (T-ALL, PTCL, CTCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), classical Hodgkin-Lymphoma (HL), Burkitt-Lymphoma (BL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). While these diseases are highly heterogenous, we highlight several similarly used approaches (combination with established therapeutics, target depletion on healthy cells), targets used in multiple diseases (CD30, CD38, TRBC1/2), and unique features that require individualized approaches. Furthermore, we focus on current limitations of CAR-T-cell therapy in individual diseases and entities such as immunocompromising tumor microenvironment (TME), risk of on-target-off-tumor effects, and differences in the occurrence of adverse events. Finally, we present an outlook into novel innovations in CAR-T-cell engineering like the use of artificial intelligence and the future role of CAR-T cells in therapy regimens in everyday clinical practice.

Title: Defining medical liability when artificial intelligence is applied on diagnostic algorithms: a systematic review.
Author: ['Cestonaro C', 'Delicati A', 'Marcante B', 'Caenazzo L', 'Tozzo P']
Journal Title: Frontiers in medicine
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is an increasingly studied and widespread phenomenon, applied in multiple clinical settings. Alongside its many potential advantages, such as easing clinicians' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy, the use of AI raises ethical and legal concerns, to which there is still no unanimous response. A systematic literature review on medical professional liability related to the use of AI-based diagnostic algorithms was conducted using the public electronic database PubMed selecting studies published from 2020 to 2023. The systematic review was performed according to 2020 PRISMA guidelines. The literature review highlights how the issue of liability in case of AI-related error and patient's damage has received growing attention in recent years. The application of AI and diagnostic algorithm moreover raises questions about the risks of using unrepresentative populations during the development and about the completeness of information given to the patient. Concerns about the impact on the fiduciary relationship between physician and patient and on the subject of empathy have also been raised. The use of AI in medical field and the application of diagnostic algorithms introduced a revolution in the doctor-patient relationship resulting in multiple possible medico-legal consequences. The regulatory framework on medical liability when AI is applied is therefore inadequate and requires urgent intervention, as there is no single and specific regulation governing the liability of various parties involved in the AI supply chain, nor on end-users. Greater attention should be paid to inherent risk in AI and the consequent need for regulations regarding product safety as well as the maintenance of minimum safety standards through appropriate updates.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of attendances to ophthalmic emergency departments are for non-urgent presentations. We developed and evaluated a machine learning system (DemDx Ophthalmology Triage System: DOTS) to optimise triage, with the aim of reducing inappropriate emergency attendances and streamlining case referral when necessary. METHODS: DOTS was built using retrospective tabular data from 11,315 attendances between July 1st, 2021, to June 15th, 2022 at Moorfields Eye Hospital Emergency Department (MEH) in London, UK. Demographic and clinical features were used as inputs and a triage recommendation was given ("see immediately", "see within a week", or "see electively"). DOTS was validated temporally and compared with triage nurses' performance (1269 attendances at MEH) and validated externally (761 attendances at the Federal University of Minas Gerais - UFMG, Brazil). It was also tested for biases and robustness to variations in disease incidences. All attendances from patients aged at least 18 years with at least one confirmed diagnosis were included in the study. FINDINGS: For identifying ophthalmic emergency attendances, on temporal validation, DOTS had a sensitivity of 94.5% [95% CI 92.3-96.1] and a specificity of 42.4% [38.8-46.1]. For comparison within the same dataset, triage nurses had a sensitivity of 96.4% [94.5-97.7] and a specificity of 25.1% [22.0-28.5]. On external validation at UFMG, DOTS had a sensitivity of 95.2% [92.5-97.0] and a specificity of 32.2% [27.4-37.0]. In simulated scenarios with varying disease incidences, the sensitivity was >/=92.2% and the specificity was >/=36.8%. No differences in sensitivity were found in subgroups of index of multiple deprivation, but the specificity was higher for Q2 when compared to Q4 (Q4 is less deprived than Q2). INTERPRETATION: At MEH, DOTS had similar sensitivity to triage nurses in determining attendance priority; however, with a specificity of 17.3% higher, DOTS resulted in lower rates of patients triaged to be seen immediately at emergency. DOTS showed consistent performance in temporal and external validation, in social-demographic subgroups and was robust to varying relative disease incidences. Further trials are necessary to validate these findings. This system will be prospectively evaluated, considering human-computer interaction, in a clinical trial.

Author: ['Popescu D', 'Ichim L', 'Stoican F']
Journal Title: Frontiers in plant science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Orchard monitoring is a vital direction of scientific research and practical application for increasing fruit production in ecological conditions. Recently, due to the development of technology and the decrease in equipment cost, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles and artificial intelligence algorithms for image acquisition and processing has achieved tremendous progress in orchards monitoring. This paper highlights the new research trends in orchard monitoring, emphasizing neural networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various concrete applications. For this purpose, papers on complex topics obtained by combining keywords from the field addressed were selected and analyzed. In particular, the review considered papers on the interval 2017-2022 on the use of neural networks (as an important exponent of artificial intelligence in image processing and understanding) and UAVs in orchard monitoring and production evaluation applications. Due to their complexity, the characteristics of UAV trajectories and flights in the orchard area were highlighted. The structure and implementations of the latest neural network systems used in such applications, the databases, the software, and the obtained performances are systematically analyzed. To recommend some suggestions for researchers and end users, the use of the new concepts and their implementations were surveyed in concrete applications, such as a) identification and segmentation of orchards, trees, and crowns; b) detection of tree diseases, harmful insects, and pests; c) evaluation of fruit production, and d) evaluation of development conditions. To show the necessity of this review, in the end, a comparison is made with review articles with a related theme.

Title: Potential Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Disaster Risk and Emergency Health Management: A Critical Appraisal on Environmental Health.
Author: ['Bari LF', 'Ahmed I', 'Ahamed R', 'Zihan TA', 'Sharmin S', 'Pranto AH', 'Islam MR']
Journal Title: Environmental health insights
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The risk evaluation of natural disasters is an obstacle to ensuring healthcare services during catastrophic events worldwide. Therefore, timely and appropriate environmental health risk evaluation is essential. In this study, we incorporated the information from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. We performed this study to explore the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) in disaster risk and emergency health management. Natural disasters have some phenomenon that is bound to happen. So, we can use AI to inform healthcare authorities about environmental health risks and emergency medical management. The recent innovations in technology have created novel opportunities for improving healthcare services across the world. AI technology would be the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution because we are entering an AI-based world this decade. Therefore, we suggest the authorities consider this positive aspect of AI technology to minimize the disastrous outcomes of any catastrophic events.
