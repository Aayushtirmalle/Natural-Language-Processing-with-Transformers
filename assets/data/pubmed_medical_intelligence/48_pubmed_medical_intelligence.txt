Author: ['Gupta P', 'Muneshwar KN', 'Juganavar A', 'Shegekar T']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: This article offers an extensive review of the changing field of mental health therapies, charting a transformational path from traditional methods to modern breakthroughs and speculating on potential future developments. The story develops by investigating historical viewpoints while reflecting on the present and highlighting the lessons learned and their impact on contemporary practices. We have advanced from the stigmatized constraints of asylums to a paradigm that puts human rights, dignity, and individualized, culturally sensitive treatment first. Modern methods are much more varied and evidence-based, from cutting-edge technical advancements to evidence-based psychotherapies. The ethical considerations arising from the delicate balance of pharmacological therapies underline the responsibility of administering drugs that significantly affect mental health. Cultural factors become a pillar, highlighting how crucial cultural sensitivity is to promoting tolerance. By acknowledging how many facets of the human experience are interrelated, holistic methods help close the gap between the mind and body. Integrative medicine and alternative therapies represent a shift away from reductionist approaches and toward a holistic viewpoint. The delivery of mental health treatment is being reimagined by technological advancements, with virtual and digital environments opening up new access and support channels. These developments cut beyond regional boundaries, reinventing conventional therapy dynamics and paving the way for individualized therapies. Cultural concerns highlight the significance of cultural competency in navigating the complex mental health treatment system and adapting interventions to fit the particular requirements of various cultural contexts. With telepsychiatry, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence among the new technologies that promise to further revolutionize mental health therapies, the essay looks to the future. This review concludes by imagining a day when mental health is prioritized, therapies are available, and the diversity of human experience is valued. The path to a society that values, nurtures, and celebrates mental health continues.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The negative impacts of maternal depression on child mental health outcomes are well-documented. However, some children show adaptive functioning following exposure to maternal depression, demonstrating resilience. In a large birth cohort from Brazil, a middle-income country, we examined direct and indirect pathways, considering socioeconomic, family, and individual factors, contributing to the development of resilience. METHODS: Using data from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort (N = 4231), we restricted the sample to those exposed to maternal depression up to age 6 years (depression present at >/=2 out of 5 assessment waves; n = 1132; 50% boys). Resilience was defined as scoring below or equal to the mean of the unexposed group on all four problem subscales of the parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 11 years. We examined pathways from socioeconomic status (SES; measured at birth) to resilience via cognitive stimulation (CS) (at 24 and 48 months) and Intelligence quotient (IQ) (at 6 years), and from CS to resilience via IQ, using counterfactual mediation. RESULTS: A minority of children exposed to maternal depression showed resilience (12.4%). There was evidence of indirect pathways from SES to resilience via CS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-3.38) and IQ (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.42), such that higher SES was associated with resilience via both higher levels of CS and higher IQ, which, in turn, were each positively associated with resilience. Furthermore, there was evidence of a direct (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.76) and total effect (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.05-3.89) of CS on resilience, even after controlling for SES. However, these effects varied depending on how persistent and severe depression was defined. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CS in early childhood may represent a modifiable protective factor for children exposed to maternal depression and a promising intervention target to promote child resilience in the context of maternal depression exposure.

Author: ['Koponen M', 'Anwaar W', 'Sheikh Q', 'Sadiq F']
Journal Title: Oman medical journal
Publication Date: 2023 Sep
Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring improves traditional risk factor-based coronary heart disease (CHD) risk stratification. Here, the contribution of CAC scoring to a traditional 10-year CHD risk prediction scores and new artificial intelligence methods used to automate CAC scoring were reviewed. Research shows that traditional risk factors tend to overestimate or underestimate the actual risk of CHD, meaning that including CAC score in the risk stratification has potential to reduce over- and undertreatment. The automated CAC scoring methods are shown to be accurate and significantly more time-effective than the commonly used semi-automated method.

Title: AMDPWE: Alphonso Mango Dataset for Precision Weight Estimation.
Author: ['Prabhu A', 'Rani NS']
Journal Title: Data in brief
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Alphonso Mango (Mangifera indica L.), is popularly known as king of mangoes in India. India is one of the leading countries in mango production. Automatic visual inspection systems for quality assessment using weight are intelligent interventions designed to evaluate fruit maturity based on various parameters. Automated systems utilize a combination of image analysis, computer vision, and artificial intelligence algorithms to estimate the weight of fruits precisely. One of the crucial quality parameters is weight, which measures the fruit's overall mass and potential quality. Integration of precision weighing mechanisms in fruit quality estimation leads to a quick and accurate method of measuring fruit weight in the marketplace. Furthermore, the fruit's demand in the market is directly connected to its size as it influences consumer preferences. Automatic precision weight estimation systems equipped with intelligent high-resolution assists in ensuring consistency in size across batches of fruits. The dataset samples consist of images of 71 Alphonso cultivars of mango fruit. The fruit is collected from the College of Horticulture Yalachahalli, Mysuru, India. The fruits were harvested in April/May 2022. The digital images of these fruits are captured using the acquisition setup with a controlled environment. Each image has a resolution of 2048x1536. The images include two orientations of each sample. The physical parameters such as the weight, fruit diameter, and width across the shoulder are also maintained. The digital images undergo pre-processing, and further, the vision-based features such as area, convex area, and minor axis for both orientations are captured.

Abstract: The 'Learning Meta-Learning' dataset presented in this paper contains both categorical and continuous data of adult learners for 7 meta-learning parameters: age, gender, degree of illusion of competence, sleep duration, chronotype, experience of the imposter phenomenon, and multiple intelligences. Convenience sampling and Simple Random Sampling methods are used to structure the anonymous online survey data collection voluntarily for LML dataset creation. The responses from the 54 survey questionnaires contain raw data from 1021 current students from 11 universities in Bangladesh. The entire dataset is stored in an excel file and the entire questionnaire is accessible at (10.5281/zenodo.8112213) In this article mean and standard deviation for the participant's baseline attributes are given for scale parameters, and frequency and percentage are calculated for categorical parameters. Academic curriculum, courses as well as professional training materials can be reviewed and redesigned with a focus on the diversity of learners. How the designed courses will be learned by learners along with how they will be taught is a significant point for education in any discipline. As the survey questionnaires are set for adult learners and only current university students have participated in this survey, this dataset is appropriate for study andragogy and heutagogy but not pedagogy.

Title: Is Artificial Intelligence the Key to Revolutionizing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Diagnosis and Management?
Author: ['Hegazi MAAA', 'Taverna G', 'Grizzi F']
Journal Title: Archivos espanoles de urologia
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent condition among older men that is characterized by the enlargement of the prostate gland and compression of the urethra, which often results in lower urinary tract symptoms, such as frequent urination, difficulty in starting urination, and incomplete bladder emptying. The development of BPH is thought to be primarily due to an imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, underlying inflammation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and local paracrine and autocrine growth factors, although the exact molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Anatomical structures considered natural and benign observations can occasionally present multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging appearances that resemble prostate cancer (PCa), posing a risk of misinterpretation and generating false-positive outcomes and subsequently, unnecessary interventions. To aid in the diagnosis of BPH, distinguish it from PCa, and assist with treatment and outcome prediction, various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have been proposed to assist clinicians in the medical practice. Here, we explore the results of these new technological advances and discuss their potential to enhance clinicians' cognitive abilities and expertise. There is no doubt that AI holds extensive medical potential, but the cornerstone for secure, efficient, and ethical integration into diverse medical fields still remains well-structured clinical trials.

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a metal additive manufacturing technique involving complex interplays between vapor, liquid, and solid phases. Despite LPBF's advantageous capabilities compared to conventional manufacturing methods, the underlying physical phenomena can result in inter-regime instabilities followed by transitions between conduction and keyhole melting regimes - leading to defects. We investigate these issues through operando synchrotron X-ray imaging synchronized with acoustic emission recording, during the remelting processes of LPBF-produced thin walls, monitoring regime changes occurring under constant laser processing parameters. The collected data show an increment in acoustic signal amplitude when switching from conduction to keyhole regime, which we correlate to changes in laser absorptivity. Moreover, a full correlation between X-ray imaging and the acoustic signals permits the design of a simple filtering algorithm to predict the melting regimes. As a result, conduction, stable keyhole, and unstable keyhole regimes are identified with a time resolution of 100 micros, even under rapid transitions, providing a straightforward method to accurately detect undesired processing regimes without the use of artificial intelligence.

Journal Title: JMIR medical education
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its extensive potential for integration into many aspects of health care signal a transformational shift within the health care environment. In this context, medical education must evolve to ensure that medical trainees are adequately prepared to navigate the rapidly changing health care landscape. Medical education has moved toward a competency-based education paradigm, leading the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to define a set of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as its practical operational framework in undergraduate medical education. The AAMC's 13 core EPAs for entering residencies have been implemented with varying levels of success across medical schools. In this paper, we critically assess the existing core EPAs in the context of rapid AI integration in medicine. We identify EPAs that require refinement, redefinition, or comprehensive change to align with the emerging trends in health care. Moreover, this perspective proposes a set of "emerging" EPAs, informed by the changing landscape and capabilities presented by generative AI technologies. We provide a practical evaluation of the EPAs, alongside actionable recommendations on how medical education, viewed through the lens of the AAMC EPAs, can adapt and remain relevant amid rapid technological advancements. By leveraging the transformative potential of AI, we can reshape medical education to align with an AI-integrated future of medicine. This approach will help equip future health care professionals with technological competence and adaptive skills to meet the dynamic and evolving demands in health care.

Title: Intelligent fault diagnosis algorithm of rolling bearing based on optimization algorithm fusion convolutional neural network.
Author: ['Wang Q', 'Sun Z', 'Zhu Y', 'Song C', 'Li D']
Journal Title: Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 2
Abstract: As an essential component of mechanical equipment, the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings may not only guarantee the systematic operation of the equipment, but also minimize any financial losses caused by equipment shutdowns. Fault diagnosis algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used. However, traditional CNNs have limited feature representation capabilities, thereby making it challenging to determine their hyperparameters. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis method that combines a 1D-CNN with an attention mechanism and hyperparameter optimization to overcome the aforementioned limitations; this method improves the search speed for optimal hyperparameters of CNN models, improves the diagnostic accuracy, and enhances the representation of fault feature information in CNNs. First, the 1D-CNN is improved by combining it with an attention mechanism to enhance the fault feature information. Second, a swarm intelligence algorithm based on Differential Evolution (DE) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is proposed, which not only improves the convergence accuracy, but also increases the search efficiency. Finally, the improved 1D-CNN alongside hyperparameters optimization are used to diagnose the faults of rolling bearings. By using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Jiangnan University (JNU) datasets, when compared to other common diagnosis models, the results demonstrate the usefulness and dependability of the DE-GWO-CNN algorithm in fault diagnosis applications by demonstrating the increased diagnostic accuracy and superior anti-noise capabilities of the proposed method. The fault diagnosis methodology presented in this paper can accurately identify faults and provide dependable fault classification, thereby assisting technicians in promptly resolving faults and minimizing equipment failures and operational instabilities.

Title: dm-GAN: Distributed multi-latent code inversion enhanced GAN for fast and accurate breast X-ray image automatic generation.
Author: ['Jiao J', 'Xiao X', 'Li Z']
Journal Title: Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE
Publication Date: 2023 Oct 23
Abstract: Breast cancer seriously threatens women's physical and mental health. Mammography is one of the most effective methods for breast cancer diagnosis via artificial intelligence algorithms to identify diverse breast masses. The popular intelligent diagnosis methods require a large amount of breast images for training. However, collecting and labeling many breast images manually is extremely time consuming and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a distributed multi-latent code inversion enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (dm-GAN) for fast, accurate and automatic breast image generation. The proposed dm-GAN takes advantage of the generator and discriminator of the GAN framework to achieve automatic image generation. The new generator in dm-GAN adopts a multi-latent code inverse mapping method to simplify the data fitting process of GAN generation and improve the accuracy of image generation, while a multi-discriminator structure is used to enhance the discrimination accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed dm-GAN can automatically generate breast images with higher accuracy, up to a higher 1.84 dB Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and lower 5.61% Frechet Inception Distance (FID), as well as 1.38x faster generation than the state-of-the-art.

Publication Date: 2023 Oct 13
Abstract: Smart technologies are advancing the development of cutting-edge systems by exploring the future network. The Internet of Things (IoT) and many multimedia sensors interact with each other for collecting and transmitting visual data. However, managing enormous amounts of data from numerous network devices is one of the main research challenges. In this context, various IoT systems have been investigated and have provided efficient data retrieval and processing solutions. For multimedia systems, however, controlling inefficient bandwidth utilization and ensuring timely transmission of vital information are key research concerns. Moreover, to transfer multimedia traffic while balancing communication costs for the IoT system, a sustainable solution with intelligence in real-life applications is demanded. Furthermore, trust must be formed for technological advancement to occur; such an approach provides the smart communication paradigm with the incorporation of edge computing. This study proposed a model for optimizing multimedia using a combination of edge computing intelligence and authentic strategies. Mobile edges analyze network states to discover the system's status and minimize communication disruptions. Moreover, direct and indirect authentication determines the reliability of data forwarders and network stability. The proposed authentication approach minimizes the possibility of data compromise and increases trust in multimedia surveillance systems. Using simulation testing, the proposed model outperformed other comparable work in terms of byte delivery, packet overhead, packet delay, and data loss metrics.

Title: An infrared small target detection model via Gather-Excite attention and normalized Wasserstein distance.
Author: ['Sun K', 'Huo J', 'Liu Q', 'Yang S']
Journal Title: Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE
Publication Date: 2023 Oct 11
Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is the main research content for defense confrontation, long-range precision strikes and battlefield intelligence reconnaissance. Targets from the aerial view have the characteristics of small size and dim signal. These characteristics affect the performance of traditional detection models. At present, the target detection model based on deep learning has made huge advances. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) series is a classic branch. In this paper, a model with better adaptation capabilities, namely ISTD-YOLOv7, is proposed for infrared small target detection. First, the anchors of YOLOv7 are updated to provide prior. Second, Gather-Excite (GE) attention is embedded in YOLOv7 to exploit feature context and spatial location information. Finally, Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) replaces IoU in the loss function to alleviate the sensitivity of YOLOv7 for location deviations of small targets. Experiments on a standard dataset show that the proposed model has stronger detection performance than YOLOv3, YOLOv5s, SSD, CenterNet, FCOS, YOLOXs, DETR and the baseline model, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 98.43%. Moreover, ablation studies indicate the effectiveness of the improved components.

Title: AB-GRU: An attention-based bidirectional GRU model for multimodal sentiment fusion and analysis.
Author: ['Wu J', 'Zheng X', 'Wang J', 'Wu J', 'Wang J']
Journal Title: Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE
Publication Date: 2023 Sep 27
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important area of artificial intelligence. It integrates multiple modalities such as text, audio, video and image into a compact multimodal representation and obtains sentiment information from them. In this paper, we improve two modules, i.e., feature extraction and feature fusion, to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis and finally propose an attention-based two-layer bidirectional GRU (AB-GRU, gated recurrent unit) multimodal sentiment analysis method. For the feature extraction module, we use a two-layer bidirectional GRU network and connect two layers of attention mechanisms to enhance the extraction of important information. The feature fusion part uses low-rank multimodal fusion, which can reduce the multimodal data dimensionality and improve the computational rate and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the AB-GRU model can achieve 80.9% accuracy on the CMU-MOSI dataset, which exceeds the same model type by at least 2.5%. The AB-GRU model also possesses a strong generalization capability and solid robustness.

Title: Online data poisoning attack against edge AI paradigm for IoT-enabled smart city.
Author: ['Zhu Y', 'Wen H', 'Wu J', 'Zhao R']
Journal Title: Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE
Publication Date: 2023 Sep 15
Abstract: The deep integration of edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT (Internet of Things)-enabled smart cities has given rise to new edge AI paradigms that are more vulnerable to attacks such as data and model poisoning and evasion of attacks. This work proposes an online poisoning attack framework based on the edge AI environment of IoT-enabled smart cities, which takes into account the limited storage space and proposes a rehearsal-based buffer mechanism to manipulate the model by incrementally polluting the sample data stream that arrives at the appropriately sized cache. A maximum-gradient-based sample selection strategy is presented, which converts the operation of traversing historical sample gradients into an online iterative computation method to overcome the problem of periodic overwriting of the sample data cache after training. Additionally, a maximum-loss-based sample pollution strategy is proposed to solve the problem of each poisoning sample being updated only once in basic online attacks, transforming the bi-level optimization problem from offline mode to online mode. Finally, the proposed online gray-box poisoning attack algorithms are implemented and evaluated on edge devices of IoT-enabled smart cities using an online data stream simulated with offline open-grid datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods in both attack effectiveness and overhead.

Title: A participatory system map of the adverse influence of urban environments on population health: integrating urban development and preventive health expertise.
Author: ['Prior J', 'Legg R', 'McIntyre E']
Journal Title: Public health research & practice
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: A growing number of urban development and public health professionals are developing expertise in how urban environments influence population health to support preventive health (PH) planning, implementation and outcomes. This study aimed to address the growing interest among these experts in Sydney, Australia, to move beyond silo-based approaches to PH planning and urban development by developing a preliminary mapping of the complex adaptive system. This is a network of agents and parts that collectively relate and interact, where they seek to intervene by meshing the disparate knowledge of their multidisciplinary expertise. This mapping will help experts to better integrate PH approaches by linking primordial and primary prevention within urban environments, collectively prioritising areas for intervention within the complex adaptive system, and developing a better understanding of relations between multiple factors at play within it. METHODS: The system map was developed using a unique participatory system-mapping (PSM) process involving a modified Delphi technique consisting of three rounds between October 2019 and August 2020 and 15 urban development and public health experts engaged in PH in Sydney's urban environment. RESULTS: The final system map encompassed features of the local environment, determinants of health and wellbeing in urban environments, pre-clinical health and wellbeing impacts, and clinical health outcomes, providing a comprehensive map of the adverse effects of urban environments on population health. There was a high level of agreement among experts on the final system map. While experts from different disciplines generally agreed on priority areas for intervention, consensus was higher among those from similar disciplinary backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights how the collective intelligence of experts from diverse disciplines can generate PSM. Furthermore, it illustrates how using systems mapping can help experts interested in complex public health problems to take a broader view of the complex adaptive system for PH planning, support collaborative prioritisation, and offer valuable insights for targeted interventions.

Journal Title: Folia phoniatrica et logopaedica : official organ of the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 5
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The stigma associated with wearing hearing aids, known as the "hearing aid effect," remains a significant issue in hearing healthcare. Despite notable changes in the look and feel of hearing aids over the last decade, little is known about the influence of socioeconomic factors on the perception of different hearing devices in a socioeconomically diverse setting. OBJECTIVE: To determine the hearing aid effect across a range of hearing devices and its association with socioeconomic factors, namely area of residence and level of education across African communities. METHOD: The study used a cross-sectional design with 322 participants (161 rural, 161 urban); mean age 31.9 years (14.7 SD). Participants rated photographs of seven different styles of devices [standard behind-the-ear hearing aid (BTE HA) with an earmould, mini BTE HA with a slim tube (ST), in-the-canal (ITC) HA, Airpod, receiver-in-canal (RIC), completely-in-canal (CIC) HA, and Personal Sound Amplification Product (PSAP)] worn by a peer model using a validated scale of eight attributes (attractiveness , age, success, hardworking, trustworthiness, intelligence, friendliness, education). The ratings of the BTE HA with earmould were used as a benchmark for comparison. RESULTS: No hearing aid effect was observed across all participants (n=322) with device ratings ranging between neutral and positive. Significant differences between device ratings were evident for attractiveness for ST and PSAP and trustworthiness for ITC. In terms of residence, urban participants provided more favorable ratings compared to rural participants, with significant differences across three attribute ratings: hardworking for ST; attractiveness, hardworking for ITC; age for RIC and Airpod and hardworking for PSAP. For level of education, significant differences were found for attributes of attractiveness (H = 13.5; p = 0.001) for ITC; attractiveness (H = 14.7, p = 0.001) for PSAP; age (H = 9.5; p = 0.009) for RIC; age (H = 14.3; p<0.001) and intelligence (H = 15.1; p< 0.001) for Airpod and; hardworking (H =11.9, p = 0.003) for ST. CONCLUSION: Overall, participants had a neutral to positive view of hearing devices with preferences for less visible, conventionally styled devices. Socioeconomic variables such as educational attainment and geographical location influence perceptions of hearing devices emphasizing the importance of taking these aspects into account when prescribing hearing devices.

Title: Grounding neuroscience in behavioral changes using artificial neural networks.
Author: ['Lindsay GW']
Journal Title: Current opinion in neurobiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: Connecting neural activity to function is a common aim in neuroscience. How to define and conceptualize function, however, can vary. Here I focus on grounding this goal in the specific question of how a given change in behavior is produced by a change in neural circuits or activity. Artificial neural network models offer a particularly fruitful format for tackling such questions because they use neural mechanisms to perform complex transformations and produce appropriate behavior. Therefore, they can be a means of causally testing the extent to which a neural change can be responsible for an experimentally observed behavioral change. Furthermore, because the field of interpretability in artificial intelligence has similar aims, neuroscientists can look to interpretability methods for new ways of identifying neural features that drive performance and behaviors.

Title: Leveraging artificial intelligence for perioperative cancer risk assessment of oral potentially malignant disorders.
Author: ['Adeoye J', 'Su YX']
Journal Title: International journal of surgery (London, England)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are mucosal conditions with an inherent disposition to develop oral squamous cell carcinoma. Surgical management is the most preferred strategy to prevent malignant transformation in OPMDs, and surgical approaches to treatment include conventional scalpel excision, laser surgery, cryotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. However, in reality, since all patients with OPMDs will not develop OSCC in their lifetime, there is a need to stratify patients according to their risk of malignant transformation to streamline surgical intervention for patients with the highest risks. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to integrate disparate factors influencing malignant transformation for robust, precise, and personalized cancer risk stratification of OPMD patients than current methods to determine the need for surgical resection, excision, or re-excision. Therefore, this article overviews existing AI models and tools, presents a clinical implementation pathway, and discusses necessary refinements to aid the clinical application of AI-based platforms for cancer risk stratification of OPMDs in surgical practice.
