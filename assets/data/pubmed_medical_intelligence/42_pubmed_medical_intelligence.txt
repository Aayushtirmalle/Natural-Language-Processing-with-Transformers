Abstract: BACKGROUND: The number of words children produce (expressive vocabulary) and understand (receptive vocabulary) changes rapidly during early development, partially due to genetic factors. Here, we performed a meta-genome-wide association study of vocabulary acquisition and investigated polygenic overlap with literacy, cognition, developmental phenotypes and neurodevelopmental conditions, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). METHODS: We studied 37,913 parent-reported vocabulary size measures (English, Dutch, Danish) for 17,298 European descent children. Meta-analyses were performed for early-phase expressive (infancy, 15-18 months), late-phase expressive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) and late-phase receptive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) vocabulary. Subsequently, we estimated Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism heritability (SNP-h(2)) and genetic correlations (r(g)), and modelled underlying factor structures with multivariate models. RESULTS: Early-life vocabulary size was modestly heritable (SNP-h(2): 0.08(SE=0.01) to 0.24(SE=0.03)). Genetic overlap between infant expressive and toddler receptive vocabulary was negligible (r(g)=0.07(SE=0.10)), although each measure was moderately related to toddler expressive vocabulary (r(g)=0.69(SE=0.14) and r(g)=0.67(SE=0.16), respectively), suggesting a multi-factorial genetic architecture. Both infant and toddler expressive vocabulary were genetically linked to literacy (e.g. spelling: r(g)=0.58(SE=0.20) and r(g)=0.79(SE=0.25), respectively), underlining genetic similarity. However, genetic association of early-life vocabulary with educational attainment and intelligence emerged in toddlerhood only (e.g. receptive vocabulary and intelligence: r(g)=0.36(SE=0.12)). Increased ADHD risk was genetically associated with larger infant expressive vocabulary (r(g)=0.23(SE=0.08)). Multivariate genetic models in the ALSPAC cohort confirmed this finding for ADHD symptoms (r(g)=0.54(SE=0.26)), but showed that the association effect reversed for toddler receptive vocabulary (r(g)=-0.74(SE=0.23)), highlighting developmental heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic architecture of early-life vocabulary changes during development, shaping polygenic association patterns with later-life ADHD, literacy and cognition-related traits.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Pathologic response (PathR) by histopathologic assessment of resected specimens may be an early clinical end point associated with long-term outcomes with neoadjuvant therapy. Digital pathology may improve the efficiency and precision of PathR assessment. LCMC3 (NCT02927301) evaluated neoadjuvant atezolizumab in patients with resectable NSCLC and reported a 20% major PathR rate. METHODS: We determined PathR in primary tumor resection specimens using guidelines-based visual techniques and developed a convolutional neural network model using the same criteria to digitally measure the percent viable tumor on whole-slide images. Concordance was evaluated between visual determination of percent viable tumor (n = 151) performed by one of the 47 local pathologists and three central pathologists. RESULTS: For concordance among visual determination of percent viable tumor, the interclass correlation coefficient was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.90). Agreement for visually assessed less than or equal to 10% viable tumor (major PathR [MPR]) in the primary tumor was 92.1% (Fleiss kappa = 0.83). Digitally assessed percent viable tumor (n = 136) correlated with visual assessment (Pearson r = 0.73; digital/visual slope = 0.28). Digitally assessed MPR predicted visually assessed MPR with outstanding discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.98) and was associated with longer disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.09-0.97, p = 0.033) and overall survival (HR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-1.06, p = 0.027) versus no MPR. Digitally assessed PathR strongly correlated with visual measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-powered digital pathology exhibits promise in assisting pathologic assessments in neoadjuvant NSCLC clinical trials. The development of artificial intelligence-powered approaches in clinical settings may aid pathologists in clinical operations, including routine PathR assessments, and subsequently support improved patient care and long-term outcomes.

Author: ['Ding H', 'Simmich J', 'Vaezipour A', 'Andrews N', 'Russell T']
Journal Title: Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Conversational agents (CAs) with emerging artificial intelligence present new opportunities to assist in health interventions but are difficult to evaluate, deterring their applications in the real world. We aimed to synthesize existing evidence and knowledge and outline an evaluation framework for CA interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic scoping review to investigate designs and outcome measures used in the studies that evaluated CAs for health interventions. We then nested the results into an overarching digital health framework proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: The review included 81 studies evaluating CAs in experimental (n = 59), observational (n = 15) trials, and other research designs (n = 7). Most studies (n = 72, 89%) were published in the past 5 years. The proposed CA-evaluation framework includes 4 evaluation stages: (1) feasibility/usability, (2) efficacy, (3) effectiveness, and (4) implementation, aligning with WHO's stepwise evaluation strategy. Across these stages, this article presents the essential evidence of different study designs (n = 8), sample sizes, and main evaluation categories (n = 7) with subcategories (n = 40). The main evaluation categories included (1) functionality, (2) safety and information quality, (3) user experience, (4) clinical and health outcomes, (5) costs and cost benefits, (6) usage, adherence, and uptake, and (7) user characteristics for implementation research. Furthermore, the framework highlighted the essential evaluation areas (potential primary outcomes) and gaps across the evaluation stages. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This review presents a new framework with practical design details to support the evaluation of CA interventions in healthcare research.

Journal Title: British journal of haematology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: In a first-of-its-kind study, we assessed the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in making complex decisions in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The evaluation was conducted not only for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) but also conducted on other artificial intelligence models: PaLm 2 and Llama-2. Using detailed haematological histories that include both clinical, molecular and donor data, we conducted a triple-blind survey to compare LLMs to haematology residents. We found that residents significantly outperformed LLMs (p = 0.02), particularly in transplant eligibility assessment (p = 0.01). Our triple-blind methodology aimed to mitigate potential biases in evaluating LLMs and revealed both their promise and limitations in deciphering complex haematological clinical scenarios.

Title: Lessons learned from investigating patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives on the design of a telerehabilitation platform.
Author: ['Amorim P', 'Paiva J', 'Silva de Lima J', 'Portugal da Fonseca L', 'Martins H', 'Silva PA']
Journal Title: Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: PURPOSE: Home self-rehabilitation exercises for musculoskeletal conditions are a valuable complement to rehabilitation plans. Telerehabilitation systems using artificial intelligence can provide reliable solutions and empower patients by providing them with guidance and motivating them to engage in rehabilitation plans and activities. This study aims to understand the patient's and physiotherapist's perspective on the requirements of effective face-to-face physiotherapy sessions to inspire the design of a telerehabilitation platform to be used in home settings. METHODS: The authors used an ethnography-informed approach through observation and semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 13) and physiotherapists (n = 10) in two outpatient rehabilitation clinics. The AEIOU framework was used to structure and analyse the observation. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the data collected from the observations and the interviews. RESULTS: Patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives emphasise the need for exercise instruction clarity, evolution monitoring, and feedback. In the absence of the physiotherapist, in home settings, patients feel insecure and fear execution difficulties and limited exercise instructions, while physiotherapists struggle with controlling patients' home exercise performance. Telerehabilitation is seen as an opportunity to move further into home self-rehabilitation programs. CONCLUSIONS: Besides home exercise monitoring and guidance, telerehabilitation platforms must allow personalization and effective communication between patients and physiotherapists.

Title: Appropriateness and Reliability of an Online Artificial Intelligence Platform's Responses to Common Questions Regarding Distal Radius Fractures.
Author: ['Christy M', 'Morris MT', 'Goldfarb CA', 'Dy CJ']
Journal Title: The Journal of hand surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: PURPOSE: Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a novel artificial intelligence chatbot that is changing the way humans gather information online. The purpose of this study was to investigate ChatGPT's ability to appropriately and reliably answer common questions regarding distal radius fractures. METHODS: Thirty common questions regarding distal radius fractures were presented in an identical manner to the online ChatGPT-3.5 interface three separate times, yielding 90 unique responses because ChatGPT produces an original answer with each query. All responses were graded as "appropriate," "appropriate but incomplete," or "inappropriate" by a consensus discussion among three hand surgeon reviewers. The questions were additionally subcategorized into one of four domains based on Bloom's cognitive learning taxonomy, and descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: Seventy of the 90 total responses (78%) produced by ChatGPT were "appropriate," and 29 of the 30 questions (97%) had at least one response considered appropriate (of the three possible). However, only 17 of the 30 questions (57%) were answered appropriately on all three iterations. The test-retest reliability of ChatGPT was poor with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.12. Finally, ChatGPT performed best answering questions requiring lower-order thinking skills (Bloom's levels 1-3) and less well on level 4 questions. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that although ChatGPT has the capability to answer common questions regarding distal radius fractures, caution should be taken before implementing its use, given ChatGPT's inconsistency in providing a complete and accurate response to the same question every time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As the popularity and technology of ChatGPT continue to grow, it is important to understand the potential and limitations of this platform to determine how it may be best implemented to improve patient care.

Title: A Butterfly-Inspired Multisensory Neuromorphic Platform for Integration of Visual and Chemical Cues.
Author: ['Zheng Y', 'Ghosh S', 'Das S']
Journal Title: Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: Unisensory cues are often insufficient for animals to effectively engage in foraging, mating, and predatory activities. In contrast, integration of cues collected from multiple sensory organs enhances the overall perceptual experience and thereby facilitates better decision-making. Despite the importance of multisensory integration in animals, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on processing unisensory information. This lack of emphasis on multisensory integration can be attributed to the absence of a miniaturized hardware platform capable of co-locating multiple sensing modalities and enabling in-sensor and near-sensor processing. In this study, this limitation is addressed by utilizing the chemo-sensing properties of graphene and the photo-sensing capability of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2) ) to create a multisensory platform for visuochemical integration. Additionally, the in-memory-compute capability of MoS(2) memtransistors is leveraged to develop neural circuits that facilitate multisensory decision-making. The visuochemical integration platform is inspired by intricate courtship of Heliconius butterflies, where female species rely on the integration of visual cues (such as wing color) and chemical cues (such as pheromones) generated by the male butterflies for mate selection. The butterfly-inspired visuochemical integration platform has significant implications in both robotics and the advancement of neuromorphic computing, going beyond unisensory intelligence and information processing.

Title: Identifying Explainable Machine Learning Models and a Novel SFRP2(+) Fibroblast Signature as Predictors for Precision Medicine in Ovarian Cancer.
Author: ['Yang Z', 'Zhou D', 'Huang J']
Journal Title: International journal of molecular sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a type of malignant tumor with a consistently high mortality rate. The diagnosis of early-stage OC and identification of functional subsets in the tumor microenvironment are essential to the development of patient management strategies. However, the development of robust models remains unsatisfactory. We aimed to utilize artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis to address this issue. Two independent datasets were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and processed to obtain overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in stage II-IV vs. stage I diseases. Three explainable machine learning algorithms were integrated to construct models that could determine the tumor stage and extract important characteristic genes as diagnostic biomarkers. Correlations between cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration and characteristic gene expression were analyzed using TIMER2.0 and their relationship with survival rates was comprehensively explored via the Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM-plotter) online database. The specific expression of characteristic genes in fibroblast subsets was investigated through single-cell analysis. A novel fibroblast subset signature was explored to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response and oncogene mutation through Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and artificial neural network algorithms, respectively. We found that Support Vector Machine-Shapley Additive Explanations (SVM-SHAP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF) successfully diagnosed early-stage OC (stage I). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of these models exceeded 0.990. Their overlapping characteristic gene, secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was a risk factor that affected the overall survival of OC patients with stage II-IV disease (log-rank test: p < 0.01) and was specifically expressed in a fibroblast subset. Finally, the SFRP2(+) fibroblast signature served as a novel predictor in evaluating ICI response and exploring pan-cancer tumor protein P53 (TP53) mutation (AUC = 0.853, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.829-0.877). In conclusion, the models based on SVM-SHAP, XGBoost, and RF enabled the early detection of OC for clinical decision making, and SFRP2(+) fibroblast signature used in diagnostic models can inform OC treatment selection and offer pan-cancer TP53 mutation detection.

Title: Enzyme Databases in the Era of Omics and Artificial Intelligence.
Author: ['Presern U', 'Golicnik M']
Journal Title: International journal of molecular sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Enzyme research is important for the development of various scientific fields such as medicine and biotechnology. Enzyme databases facilitate this research by providing a wide range of information relevant to research planning and data analysis. Over the years, various databases that cover different aspects of enzyme biology (e.g., kinetic parameters, enzyme occurrence, and reaction mechanisms) have been developed. Most of the databases are curated manually, which improves reliability of the information; however, such curation cannot keep pace with the exponential growth in published data. Lack of data standardization is another obstacle for data extraction and analysis. Improving machine readability of databases is especially important in the light of recent advances in deep learning algorithms that require big training datasets. This review provides information regarding the current state of enzyme databases, especially in relation to the ever-increasing amount of generated research data and recent advancements in artificial intelligence algorithms. Furthermore, it describes several enzyme databases, providing the reader with necessary information for their use.

Abstract: Photo-based dietary assessment is becoming more feasible as artificial intelligence methods improve. However, advancement of these methods for dietary assessment in research settings has been hindered by the lack of an appropriate dataset against which to benchmark algorithm performance. We conducted the Surveying Nutrient Assessment with Photographs of Meals (SNAPMe) study (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT05008653) to pair meal photographs with traditional food records. Participants were recruited nationally, and 110 enrollment meetings were completed via web-based video conferencing. Participants uploaded and annotated their meal photos using a mobile phone app called Bitesnap and completed food records using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24((R))) version 2020. Participants included photos before and after eating non-packaged and multi-serving packaged meals, as well as photos of the front and ingredient labels for single-serving packaged foods. The SNAPMe Database (DB) contains 3311 unique food photos linked with 275 ASA24 food records from 95 participants who photographed all foods consumed and recorded food records in parallel for up to 3 study days each. The use of the SNAPMe DB to evaluate ingredient prediction demonstrated that the publicly available algorithms FB Inverse Cooking and Im2Recipe performed poorly, especially for single-ingredient foods and beverages. Correlations between nutrient estimates common to the Bitesnap and ASA24 dietary assessment tools indicated a range in predictive capacity across nutrients (cholesterol, adjusted R(2) = 0.85, p < 0.0001; food folate, adjusted R(2) = 0.21, p < 0.05). SNAPMe DB is a publicly available benchmark for photo-based dietary assessment in nutrition research. Its demonstrated utility suggested areas of needed improvement, especially the prediction of single-ingredient foods and beverages.

Journal Title: Plants (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Plant physiological status is the interaction between the plant genome and the prevailing growth conditions. Accurate characterization of plant physiology is, therefore, fundamental to effective plant phenotyping studies; particularly those focused on identifying traits associated with improved yield, lower input requirements, and climate resilience. Here, we outline the approaches used to assess plant physiology and how these techniques of direct empirical observations of processes such as photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation, stomatal conductance, photosystem II electron transport, or the effectiveness of protective energy dissipation mechanisms are unsuited to high-throughput phenotyping applications. Novel optical sensors, remote/proximal sensing (multi- and hyperspectral reflectance, infrared thermography, sun-induced fluorescence), LiDAR, and automated analyses of below-ground development offer the possibility to infer plant physiological status and growth. However, there are limitations to such 'indirect' approaches to gauging plant physiology. These methodologies that are appropriate for the rapid high temporal screening of a number of crop varieties over a wide spatial scale do still require 'calibration' or 'validation' with direct empirical measurement of plant physiological status. The use of deep-learning and artificial intelligence approaches may enable the effective synthesis of large multivariate datasets to more accurately quantify physiological characters rapidly in high numbers of replicate plants. Advances in automated data collection and subsequent data processing represent an opportunity for plant phenotyping efforts to fully integrate fundamental physiological data into vital efforts to ensure food and agro-economic sustainability.

Author: ['Marek K', 'Redlicka J', 'Miller E', 'Zubrycki I']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: There is a wide variety of tools and measures for rehabilitation outcomes in post-stroke patients with impairments in the upper limb and hand, such as paralysis, paresis, flaccidity, and spasticity. However, there is a lack of general recommendations for selecting the most appropriate scales, tests, and instruments to objectively evaluate therapy outcomes. Reviews on upper limb and hand measurements reveal that clinicians' choices of tools and methods are highly varied. Some clinicians and medical teams continue to employ non-standard and unverified metrics in their research and measurements. This review article aims to identify the key parameters, assessed by outcome measures and instruments, that play a crucial role in upper limb and hand rehabilitation for post-stroke patients, specifically focusing on the recovery of hand function. The review seeks to assist researchers and medical teams in selecting appropriate outcome measures when evaluating post-stroke patients. We analyze the measured factors and skills found in these outcome measures and highlight useful tools that diversify assessments and enhance result objectivity through graphical representation. The paper also describes trends and new possibilities in hand outcome measures. Clinicians frequently use proven devices, such as EMG, goniometers, and hand dynamometers. Still, there is a growing trend towards incorporating technologies, such as pose and position estimation, using artificial intelligence, or custom hand grip measurement devices. Researchers are increasingly adopting scales previously successful in orthopedic and surgical patients, recognizing their potential for objectivizing outcomes in neurological patients with post-stroke hand complications. The review included only adults over the age of 18. Outcome measures were tested for usefulness in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.

Title: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Pancreatic Cancer Care: Early Detection, Liquid Biopsies, Precision Medicine and Artificial Intelligence.
Author: ['Daamen LA', 'Molenaar IQ', 'Groot VP']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: The incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is rising. While surgical techniques and peri-operative care have improved, the overall survival for PDAC remains poor. Thus, novel and bold research initiatives are needed along the spectrum of clinical care, a few of which will be discussed in this article. Early detection is crucial, with specific high-risk groups possibly benefiting from targeted screening programs. Liquid biopsies (such as circulating exosomes, tumor DNA, or tumor cells) offer promise as multifunctional biomarkers for early detection, treatment guidance, and recurrence monitoring. Precision medicine is being explored via targeted therapies for actionable mutations, such as PARP inhibitors for BRCA mutations, and immunotherapy strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool in medical imaging, biomarker discovery, genetics research, and treatment planning, and it can aid in diagnosis, treatment selection, and patient monitoring. However, its associated challenges include ethics, data security, algorithm reliability, and validation. Collaborative efforts between medical professionals, researchers, and AI experts are vital for unlocking AI's potential to enhance pancreatic cancer care. In conclusion, despite the challenges, advancements in liquid biopsies, precision medicine, and AI offer hope for enhancing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pancreatic cancer.

Title: Introduction of Deep Learning-Based Infrared Image Analysis to Marginal Reflex Distance1 Measurement Method to Simultaneously Capture Images and Compute Results: Clinical Validation Study.
Author: ['Song B', 'Kwon H', 'Kim S', 'Ha Y', 'Oh SH', 'Song SH']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: Marginal reflex distance1 (MRD1) is a crucial clinical tool used to evaluate the position of the eyelid margin in relation to the cornea. Traditionally, this assessment has been conducted manually by plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, or trained technicians. However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, there is a growing interest in the development of automated systems capable of accurately measuring MRD1. In this context, we introduce novel MRD1 measurement methods based on deep learning algorithms that can simultaneously capture images and compute the results. This prospective observational study involved 154 eyes of 77 patients aged over 18 years who visited Chungnam National University Hospital between 1 January 2023 and 29 July 2023. We collected four different MRD1 datasets from patients using three distinct measurement methods, each tailored to the individual patient. The mean MRD1 values, measured through the manual method using a penlight, the deep learning method, ImageJ analysis from RGB eye images, and ImageJ analysis from IR eye images in 56 eyes of 28 patients, were 2.64 +/- 1.04 mm, 2.85 +/- 1.07 mm, 2.78 +/- 1.08 mm, and 3.07 +/- 0.95 mm, respectively. Notably, the strongest agreement was observed between MRD1_deep learning (DL) and MRD1_IR (0.822, p < 0.01). In a Bland-Altman plot, the smallest difference was observed between MRD1_DL and MRD1_IR ImageJ, with a mean difference of 0.0611 and DeltaLOA (limits of agreement) of 2.5162, which was the smallest among all of the groups. In conclusion, this novel MRD1 measurement method, based on an IR camera and deep learning, demonstrates statistical significance and can be readily applied in clinical settings.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Addressing intraoperative bleeding remains a significant challenge in the field of robotic surgery. This research endeavors to pioneer a groundbreaking solution utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The objective is to establish a system capable of forecasting instances of intraoperative bleeding during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and promptly notify the surgeon about bleeding risks. METHODS: To achieve this, a multi-task learning (MTL) CNN was introduced, leveraging a modified version of the U-Net architecture. The aim was to categorize video input as either "absence of blood accumulation" (0) or "presence of blood accumulation" (1). To facilitate seamless interaction with the neural networks, the Bleeding Artificial Intelligence-based Detector (BLAIR) software was created using the Python Keras API and built upon the PyQT framework. A subsequent clinical assessment of BLAIR's efficacy was performed, comparing its bleeding identification performance against that of a urologist. Various perioperative variables were also gathered. For optimal MTL-CNN training parameterization, a multi-task loss function was adopted to enhance the accuracy of event detection by taking advantage of surgical tools' semantic segmentation. Additionally, the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) approach was employed to assess software performance. RESULTS: The MTL-CNN demonstrated a remarkable event recognition accuracy of 90.63%. When evaluating BLAIR's predictive ability and its capacity to pre-warn surgeons of potential bleeding incidents, the density plot highlighted a striking similarity between BLAIR and human assessments. In fact, BLAIR exhibited a faster response. Notably, the MCA analysis revealed no discernible distinction between the software and human performance in accurately identifying instances of bleeding. CONCLUSION: The BLAIR software proved its competence by achieving over 90% accuracy in predicting bleeding events during RARP. This accomplishment underscores the potential of AI to assist surgeons during interventions. This study exemplifies the positive impact AI applications can have on surgical procedures.

Abstract: Vascular inflammation is recognized as the primary trigger of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, current noninvasive methods are not capable of accurately detecting coronary inflammation. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT), in addition to their role as an energy reserve system, have been found to contribute to the development and progression of coronary artery calcification, inflammation, and plaque vulnerability. They also participate in the vascular response during ischemia, sympathetic stimuli, and arrhythmia. As a result, the evaluation of EAT and PCAT using imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and nuclear imaging has gained significant attention. PCAT-CT attenuation, which measures the average CT attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) of the adipose tissue, reflects adipocyte differentiation/size and leukocyte infiltration. It is emerging as a marker of tissue inflammation and has shown prognostic value in coronary artery disease (CAD), being associated with plaque development, vulnerability, and rupture. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), an inflammatory pericoronary microenvironment promoted by dysfunctional EAT/PCAT has been demonstrated, and more recently, it has been associated with plaque rupture in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Endothelial dysfunction, known for its detrimental effects on coronary vessels and its association with plaque progression, is bidirectionally linked to PCAT. PCAT modulates the secretory profile of endothelial cells in response to inflammation and also plays a crucial role in regulating vascular tone in the coronary district. Consequently, dysregulated PCAT has been hypothesized to contribute to type 2 myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and coronary vasculitis. Recently, quantitative measures of EAT derived from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have been included in artificial intelligence (AI) models for cardiovascular risk stratification. These models have shown incremental utility in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared to plaque characteristics alone. Therefore, the analysis of PCAT and EAT, particularly through PCAT-CT attenuation, appears to be a safe, valuable, and sufficiently specific noninvasive method for accurately identifying coronary inflammation and subsequent high-risk plaque. These findings are supported by biopsy and in vivo evidence. Although speculative, these pieces of evidence open the door for a fascinating new strategy in cardiovascular risk stratification. The incorporation of PCAT and EAT analysis, mainly through PCAT-CT attenuation, could potentially lead to improved risk stratification and guide early targeted primary prevention and intensive secondary prevention in patients at higher risk of cardiac events.

Abstract: With the recent rise in violent crime, the real-time situation analysis capabilities of the prevalent closed-circuit television have been employed for the deterrence and resolution of criminal activities. Anomaly detection can identify abnormal instances such as violence within the patterns of a specified dataset; however, it faces challenges in that the dataset for abnormal situations is smaller than that for normal situations. Herein, using datasets such as UBI-Fights, RWF-2000, and UCSD Ped1 and Ped2, anomaly detection was approached as a binary classification problem. Frames extracted from each video with annotation were reconstructed into a limited number of images of 3x3, 4x3, 4x4, 5x3 sizes using the method proposed in this paper, forming an input data structure similar to a light field and patch of vision transformer. The model was constructed by applying a convolutional block attention module that included channel and spatial attention modules to a residual neural network with depths of 10, 18, 34, and 50 in the form of a three-dimensional convolution. The proposed model performed better than existing models in detecting abnormal behavior such as violent acts in videos. For instance, with the undersampled UBI-Fights dataset, our network achieved an accuracy of 0.9933, a loss value of 0.0010, an area under the curve of 0.9973, and an equal error rate of 0.0027. These results may contribute significantly to solve real-world issues such as the detection of violent behavior in artificial intelligence systems using computer vision and real-time video monitoring.

Title: BezierCE: Low-Light Image Enhancement via Zero-Reference Bezier Curve Estimation.

Abstract: Due to problems such as the shooting light, viewing angle, and camera equipment, low-light images with low contrast, color distortion, high noise, and unclear details can be seen regularly in real scenes. These low-light images will not only affect our observation but will also greatly affect the performance of computer vision processing algorithms. Low-light image enhancement technology can help to improve the quality of images and make them more applicable to fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance images through Bezier curve estimation. We estimate the pixel-level Bezier curve by training a deep neural network (BCE-Net) to adjust the dynamic range of a given image. Based on the good properties of the Bezier curve, in that it is smooth, continuous, and differentiable everywhere, low-light image enhancement through Bezier curve mapping is effective. The advantages of BCE-Net's brevity and zero-reference make it generalizable to other low-light conditions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
