Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global workforce, presenting unprecedented challenges to managers and practitioners of strategic human resource management. Pandemic-influenced changes in the employment relationship highlighting the need for adaptation in order to facilitate a return to pre-pandemic conditions. Crises such as this can have a detrimental effect on employees' psychological contract, which in turn can hinder the organization's ability to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and impede the development of high commitment levels in the aftermath of the crisis. Emotional intelligence plays an increasingly vital role in effectively navigating the crisis and providing support to employees, while also facilitating the reconstruction of the psychological contract. Therefore, this study aims to explain the role of emotional intelligence of strategic human resource management practitioners on affective organizational commitment and the possible mediating effect of the psychological contract in that relationship. A quantitative study took place in February 2023 among 286 HR directors, HR managers, and HR officers in higher education institutions in Georgia. Partial Least Squares for Structural Equation Modelling was applied for data analysis. The results revealed that the emotional intelligence of strategic human resource management practitioners has a positive impact on the psychological contract and the affective organizational commitment. This study supports the idea that emotional intelligence can transform strategic human resource management practitioners into individuals who engage in people-orientated activities. These activities aim to effectively acquire, utilize, and retain employees within an organization. The study also suggests that emotional intelligence can provide solutions to maintain high employee commitment during times of crisis and in the aftermath of unprecedented situations.

Abstract: Airway procedures in life-threatening situations are vital for saving lives. Video laryngoscopy (VL) is commonly performed during endotracheal intubation (ETI) in the emergency department. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in the medical field, particularly to detect anatomical structures. This study aimed to develop an AI algorithm that detects vocal cords from VL images acquired during emergent situations. This retrospective study used VL images acquired in the emergency department to facilitate the ETI. The vocal cord image was labeled with a ground-truth bounding box. The dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. The algorithm was developed from a training dataset using the YOLOv4 model. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using a test set. The test set was further divided into specific environments during the ETI for clinical subgroup analysis. In total, 20,161 images from 84 patients were used in this study. A total of 10,287, 5766, and 4108 images were used for the model training, validation, and test sets, respectively. The developed algorithm achieved F1 score 0.906, sensitivity 0.963, and specificity 0.842 in the validation set. The performance in the test set was F1 score 0.808, sensitivity 0.823, and specificity 0.804. We developed and validated an AI algorithm to detect vocal cords in VL. This algorithm demonstrated a high performance. The algorithm can be used to determine the vocal cord to ensure safe ETI.

Title: College Students' Employability, Cognition, and Demands for ChatGPT in the AI Era Among Chinese Nursing Students: Web-Based Survey.
Author: ['Luo Y', 'Weng H', 'Yang L', 'Ding Z', 'Wang Q']
Journal Title: JMIR formative research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread use of ChatGPT, nursing students' artificial intelligence quotient (AIQ), employability, cognition, and demand for ChatGPT are worthy of attention. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate Chinese nursing students' AIQ and employability status as well as their cognition and demand for the latest AI tool-ChatGPT. This study was conducted to guide future initiatives in nursing intelligence education and to improve the employability of nursing students. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional survey to understand nursing college students' AIQ, employability, cognition, and demand for ChatGPT. Using correlation analysis and multiple hierarchical regression analysis, we explored the relevant factors in the employability of nursing college students. RESULTS: In this study, out of 1788 students, 1453 (81.30%) had not used ChatGPT, and 1170 (65.40%) had never heard of ChatGPT before this survey. College students' employability scores were positively correlated with AIQ, self-regulation ability, and their home location and negatively correlated with school level. Additionally, men scored higher on college students' employability compared to women. Furthermore, 76.5% of the variance was explained by the multiple hierarchical regression model for predicting college students' employability scores. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese nursing students have limited familiarity and experience with ChatGPT, while their AIQ remains intermediate. Thus, educators should pay more attention to cultivating nursing students' AIQ and self-regulation ability to enhance their employability. Employability, especially for female students, those from rural backgrounds, and students in key colleges, deserves more attention in future educational efforts.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent advances in hardware and software enabled the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for analysis of complex data in a wide range of daily-life use cases. We aim to explore the benefits of applying AI to a specific use case in transplant nephrology: risk prediction for severe posttransplant events. For the first time, we combine multinational real-world transplant data, which require specific legal and technical protection measures. OBJECTIVE: The German-Canadian NephroCAGE consortium aims to develop and evaluate specific processes, software tools, and methods to (1) combine transplant data of more than 8000 cases over the past decades from leading transplant centers in Germany and Canada, (2) implement specific measures to protect sensitive transplant data, and (3) use multinational data as a foundation for developing high-quality prognostic AI models. METHODS: To protect sensitive transplant data addressing the first and second objectives, we aim to implement a decentralized NephroCAGE federated learning infrastructure upon a private blockchain. Our NephroCAGE federated learning infrastructure enables a switch of paradigms: instead of pooling sensitive data into a central database for analysis, it enables the transfer of clinical prediction models (CPMs) to clinical sites for local data analyses. Thus, sensitive transplant data reside protected in their original sites while the comparable small algorithms are exchanged instead. For our third objective, we will compare the performance of selected AI algorithms, for example, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, as foundation for CPMs to predict severe short- and long-term posttransplant risks, for example, graft failure or mortality. The CPMs will be trained on donor and recipient data from retrospective cohorts of kidney transplant patients. RESULTS: We have received initial funding for NephroCAGE in February 2021. All clinical partners have applied for and received ethics approval as of 2022. The process of exploration of clinical transplant database for variable extraction has started at all the centers in 2022. In total, 8120 patient records have been retrieved as of August 2023. The development and validation of CPMs is ongoing as of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we will (1) combine kidney transplant data from nephrology centers in Germany and Canada, (2) implement federated learning as a foundation to use such real-world transplant data as a basis for the training of CPMs in a privacy-preserving way, and (3) develop a learning software system to investigate population specifics, for example, to understand population heterogeneity, treatment specificities, and individual impact on selected posttransplant outcomes.

Title: Medical Student Experiences and Perceptions of ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence: Cross-Sectional Study.
Author: ['Alkhaaldi SMI', 'Kassab CH', 'Dimassi Z', 'Oyoun Alsoud L', 'Al Fahim M', 'Al Hageh C', 'Ibrahim H']
Journal Title: JMIR medical education
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way medicine is learned, taught, and practiced, and medical education must prepare learners for these inevitable changes. Academic medicine has, however, been slow to embrace recent AI advances. Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has emerged as a fast and user-friendly large language model that can assist health care professionals, medical educators, students, trainees, and patients. While many studies focus on the technology's capabilities, potential, and risks, there is a gap in studying the perspective of end users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gauge the experiences and perspectives of graduating medical students on ChatGPT and AI in their training and future careers. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of recently graduated medical students was conducted in an international academic medical center between May 5, 2023, and June 13, 2023. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate variable frequencies. RESULTS: Of 325 applicants to the residency programs, 265 completed the survey (an 81.5% response rate). The vast majority of respondents denied using ChatGPT in medical school, with 20.4% (n=54) using it to help complete written assessments and only 9.4% using the technology in their clinical work (n=25). More students planned to use it during residency, primarily for exploring new medical topics and research (n=168, 63.4%) and exam preparation (n=151, 57%). Male students were significantly more likely to believe that AI will improve diagnostic accuracy (n=47, 51.7% vs n=69, 39.7%; P=.001), reduce medical error (n=53, 58.2% vs n=71, 40.8%; P=.002), and improve patient care (n=60, 65.9% vs n=95, 54.6%; P=.007). Previous experience with AI was significantly associated with positive AI perception in terms of improving patient care, decreasing medical errors and misdiagnoses, and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses (P=.001, P<.001, P=.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The surveyed medical students had minimal formal and informal experience with AI tools and limited perceptions of the potential uses of AI in health care but had overall positive views of ChatGPT and AI and were optimistic about the future of AI in medical education and health care. Structured curricula and formal policies and guidelines are needed to adequately prepare medical learners for the forthcoming integration of AI in medicine.

Title: Groundwater quality index development using the ANN model of Delhi Metropolitan City, India.
Author: ['Gani A', 'Singh M', 'Pathak S', 'Hussain A']
Journal Title: Environmental science and pollution research international
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: Groundwater is widely recognized as a vital source of fresh drinking water worldwide. However, the rapid, unregulated population growth and increased industrialization, coupled with a rise in human activities, have significantly harmed the quality of groundwater. Changes in the local topography and drainage systems in an area have negative impacts on both the quality and quantity of groundwater. This underscores the critical need to assess the susceptibility of groundwater to pollution and implement measures to mitigate these risks. The water quality index (WQI) is an approach that simulates the water quality at peculiar locations for a particular period of time. The artificial neural network (ANN) model approach is such an idealistic methodology that can be utilized for WQI development and provides better results for specific locations in optimum time. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to provide a unique way for using artificial neural networks (ANN) to characterize the groundwater quality of Delhi Metropolitan City, India. In order to make the water fit for residential and drinking use, the research also pinpoints the geographical variability and spots where the contaminated region has to be sufficiently cleaned. A minimum WQI of 41.51 was obtained at the Jagatpur location while a maximum value of 779.01 was at the Peeragarhi location. During the training phase, the results obtained using the ANN model were highly favorable, demonstrating a strong association with an R-value of 98.10%, thus highlighting the program's exceptional efficiency. However, in accordance with the correlation regression findings, the prediction outcomes of the ANN model in testing are observed to be an R-value of 99.99-100%. This study confirms the promise and advantages of employing advanced artificial intelligence in managing groundwater quality in the studied area.

Title: Technical, economic, and environmental assessment of a stand-alone power system based on diesel engine with/without energy storage using an optimization algorithm: A case study in China.
Author: ['Chen Y', 'Zhang S']
Journal Title: Environmental science and pollution research international
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: In stand-alone power systems, technical, economic, and environmental (TEE) assessment of hybrid energy systems under uncertainty is an important issue. This paper focuses on the TEE assessment of a stand-alone hybrid energy system composed of photovoltaic (PV) and diesel generator (DG) with/without battery energy storage (BS) in remote islands in China. So, determining the optimal sizes of PV and DG with/without BS for economic, reliable, and efficient operation of a hybrid power system in a microgrid is important. For this goal, a modified swarm intelligence algorithm is used to optimize, techno-economic feasibility and avoid potential CO(2) emission. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified swarm intelligence algorithm, it is compared with the standard swarm intelligence method and simple simulated annealing method in terms of operational cost reduction and power loss reduction. The aim of the optimization is to minimize the cost of a stand-alone solar power system based on diesel engine with/without battery energy storage system by optimal determination of the load uncertainty and CO(2) emission. The optimal results are developed further by performing sensitivity analysis, such as the effect of the fuel cost and the penalty cost of CO(2) emission. Over the case study, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm obtains more promising results in terms of TEE aspects. The reliability, low carbon, and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone solar power systems based on diesel engine with battery energy storage system can be easily calculated using the correlations derived in this analysis. The resulting cost of energy is in the range of 0.2845 to 0.6492 $/kWh.

Title: Safety risk assessment of sustainable construction based on projection pursuit model optimized by multi-intelligent algorithm: a case study of new chemical projects.
Author: ['Ju W', 'Xing Z', 'Shinwari M']
Journal Title: Environmental science and pollution research international
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: With the rapid development of urban and social economies, the safety accidents in the construction process of the new chemical plant have caused huge losses to the city. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risks in the construction process of chemical projects and propose preventive measures. A novel risk assessment model based on multi-intelligence algorithm optimization projection pursuit was developed to assess the construction safety risk and determine the risk level. In this model, the best-worst method and the entropy weight method were used as subjective and objective evaluation methods, respectively. The theory based on the idea of the distance function was applied to the model to calculate the combined weight value. The results showed that the three evaluation objects with the highest risk value were the air compression station plant, regional control room, and hazardous and solid waste temporary repository. The risk values of these three buildings were 2.2557, 2.2160, and 2.1654, respectively, and the corresponding risk level was high. On-site safety managers should take immediate measures in these high-risk buildings to reduce the possibility of accidents. This study is a new attempt to consider the construction safety risk of the new chemical project.

Journal Title: Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metastatic spread is characterized by considerable heterogeneity in most cancers. With increasing treatment options for patients with metastatic disease, there is a need for insight into metastatic patterns of spread in breast cancer patients using large-scale studies. METHODS: Records of 2622 metastatic breast cancer patients who underwent autopsy (1974-2010) were retrieved from the nationwide Dutch pathology databank (PALGA). Natural language processing (NLP) and manual information extraction (IE) were applied to identify the tumors, patient characteristics, and locations of metastases. RESULTS: The accuracy (0.90) and recall (0.94) of the NLP model outperformed manual IE (on 132 randomly selected patients). Adenocarcinoma no special type more frequently metastasizes to the lung (55.7%) and liver (51.8%), whereas, invasive lobular carcinoma mostly spread to the bone (54.4%) and liver (43.8%), respectively. Patients with tumor grade III had a higher chance of developing bone metastases (61.6%). In a subgroup of patients, we found that ER+/HER2+ patients were more likely to metastasize to the liver and bone, compared to ER-/HER2+ patients. CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale study that demonstrates that artificial intelligence methods are efficient for IE from Dutch databanks. Different histological subtypes show different frequencies and combinations of metastatic sites which may reflect the underlying biology of metastatic breast cancer.

Journal Title: Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to demonstrate the performance of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) language model, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.), in generating the informed consent (IC) document of blepharoplasty. METHODS: A total of 2 prompts were provided to ChatGPT to generate IC documents. Four board-certified plastic surgeons and 4 nonmedical staff members evaluated the AI-generated IC documents and the original IC document currently used in the clinical setting. They assessed these documents in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and accessibility. RESULTS: Among board-certified plastic surgeons, the initial AI-generated IC document scored significantly lower than the original IC document in accuracy (p < 0.001), informativeness (p = 0.005), and accessibility (p = 0.021), while the revised AI-generated IC document scored lower compared with the original document in accuracy (p = 0.03) and accessibility (p = 0.021). Among nonmedical staff members, no statistical significance of 2 AI-generated IC documents was observed compared with the original document in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that current ChatGPT cannot be used as a distinct patient education resource. However, it has the potential to make better IC documents when improving the professional terminology. This AI technology will eventually transform ophthalmic plastic surgery healthcare systematics by enhancing patient education and decision-making via IC documents.

Abstract: Artificial-intelligence-based methods are regularly used in the biomedical sciences, mainly in the field of diagnostic imaging. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been trained to score pleurisy and pneumonia in slaughtered pigs. The aim of this study is to further evaluate the performance of a convolutional neural network when compared with the gold standard (i.e., scores provided by a skilled operator along the slaughter chain through visual inspection and palpation). In total, 441 lungs (180 healthy and 261 diseased) are included in this study. Each lung was scored according to traditional methods, which represent the gold standard (Madec's and Christensen's grids). Moreover, the same lungs were photographed and thereafter scored by a trained convolutional neural network. Overall, the results reveal that the convolutional neural network is very specific (95.55%) and quite sensitive (85.05%), showing a rather high correlation when compared with the scores provided by a skilled veterinarian (Spearman's coefficient = 0.831, p < 0.01). In summary, this study suggests that convolutional neural networks could be effectively used at slaughterhouses and stimulates further investigation in this field of research.

Title: Next-Generation Sequencing for the Detection of Microbial Agents in Avian Clinical Samples.
Author: ['Afonso CL', 'Afonso AM']
Journal Title: Veterinary sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: Direct-targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS), with its undoubtedly superior diagnostic capacity over real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and direct-non-targeted NGS (ntNGS), with its higher capacity to identify and characterize multiple agents, are both likely to become diagnostic methods of choice in the future. tNGS is a rapid and sensitive method for precise characterization of suspected agents. ntNGS, also known as agnostic diagnosis, does not require a hypothesis and has been used to identify unsuspected infections in clinical samples. Implemented in the form of multiplexed total DNA metagenomics or as total RNA sequencing, the approach produces comprehensive and actionable reports that allow semi-quantitative identification of most of the agents present in respiratory, cloacal, and tissue samples. The diagnostic benefits of the use of direct tNGS and ntNGS are high specificity, compatibility with different types of clinical samples (fresh, frozen, FTA cards, and paraffin-embedded), production of nearly complete infection profiles (viruses, bacteria, fungus, and parasites), production of "semi-quantitative" information, direct agent genotyping, and infectious agent mutational information. The achievements of NGS in terms of diagnosing poultry problems are described here, along with future applications. Multiplexing, development of standard operating procedures, robotics, sequencing kits, automated bioinformatics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are disciplines converging toward the use of this technology for active surveillance in poultry farms. Other advances in human and veterinary NGS sequencing are likely to be adaptable to avian species in the future.

Journal Title: Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: Memristors are recognized as crucial devices for future nonvolatile memory and artificial intelligence. Due to their typical neuron-synapse-like metal-insulator-metal(MIM) sandwich structure, they are widely used to simulate biological synapses and have great potential in advancing biological synapse simulation. However, the high switch voltage and inferior stability of the memristor restrict the broader application to the emulation of the biological synapse. In this study, we report a vertically structured memristor based on few-layer MoS2. The device shows a lower switching voltage below 0.6 V, with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 104, good stability of more than 180 cycles, and a long retention time exceeding 3 x 103 s. In addition, the device has successfully simulated various biological synaptic functions, including potential/depression propagation, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and long-term potentiation/long-term depression (LTP/LTD) modulation. These results have significant implications for the design of a two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides composite material memristor that aim to mimic biological synapses, representing promising avenues for the development of advanced neuromorphic computing systems.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: A mathematical concept, n-tuples are originally applied to medicinal chemistry, especially with the creation of scaffold diversity inspired by the hybridisation of different commercial drugs with cytarabine, a synthetic arabinonucleoside derived from two marine natural products, spongouridine and spongothymidine. The new methodology explores the virtual chemical-factorial combination of different commercial drugs (immunosuppressant, antibiotic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer) with the anticancer drug cytarabine. Real chemical combinations were designed and synthesised for 8-duples, obtaining a small representative library of interesting organic molecules to be biologically tested as proof of concept. The synthesised library contains classical molecular properties regarding the Lipinski rules and/or beyond rules of five (bRo5) and is represented by the covalent combination of the anticancer drug cytarabine with ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, folic acid, sulfasalazine, ciprofloxacin, bortezomib, and methotrexate. The insertion of specific nomenclature could be implemented into artificial intelligence algorithms in order to enhance the efficiency of drug-hunting programs. The novel methodology has proven useful for the straightforward synthesis of most of the theoretically proposed duples and, in principle, could be extended to any other central drug.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common ocular microvascular complication of diabetes, contributes significantly to diabetes-related vision loss. This study addresses the imperative need for early diagnosis of DR and precise treatment strategies based on the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework. The study integrated clinical, biochemical, and metabolomic biomarkers associated with the following classes: non-DR (NDR), non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. To create machine learning (ML) models, 10% of the data was divided into validation sets and 90% into discovery sets. The validation dataset was used for hyperparameter optimization and feature selection stages, while the discovery dataset was used to measure the performance of the models. A 10-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the performance of ML models. Biomarker discovery was performed using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), Boruta, and explainable boosting machine (EBM). The predictive proposed framework compares the results of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), natural gradient boosting for probabilistic prediction (NGBoost), and EBM models in determining the DR subclass. The hyperparameters of the models were optimized using Bayesian optimization. Combining EBM feature selection with XGBoost, the optimal model achieved (91.25 +/- 1.88) % accuracy, (89.33 +/- 1.80) % precision, (91.24 +/- 1.67) % recall, (89.37 +/- 1.52) % F1-Score, and (97.00 +/- 0.25) % the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). According to the EBM explanation, the six most important biomarkers in determining the course of DR were tryptophan (Trp), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C42:2 (PC.aa.C42.2), butyrylcarnitine (C4), tyrosine (Tyr), hexadecanoyl carnitine (C16) and total dimethylarginine (DMA). The identified biomarkers may provide a better understanding of the progression of DR, paving the way for more precise and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.

Title: Explaining the Validity of the ASVAB for Job-Relevant Multitasking Performance: The Role of Placekeeping Ability.
Author: ['Hambrick DZ', 'Burgoyne AP', 'Altmann EM', 'Matteson TJ']
Journal Title: Journal of Intelligence
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: Scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) predict military job (and training) performance better than any single variable so far identified. However, it remains unclear what factors explain this predictive relationship. Here, we investigated the contributions of fluid intelligence (Gf) and two executive functions-placekeeping ability and attention control-to the relationship between the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score from the ASVAB and job-relevant multitasking performance. Psychometric network analyses revealed that Gf and placekeeping ability independently contributed to and largely explained the AFQT-multitasking performance relationship. The contribution of attention control to this relationship was negligible. However, attention control did relate positively and significantly to Gf and placekeeping ability, consistent with the hypothesis that it is a cognitive "primitive" underlying the individual differences in higher-level cognition. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed stronger evidence for the incremental validity of Gf and placekeeping ability in the prediction of multitasking performance than for the incremental validity of attention control. The results shed light on factors that may underlie the predictive validity of global measures of cognitive ability and suggest how the ASVAB might be augmented to improve its predictive validity.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: Despite growing research on adults with specific learning disabilities (SLDs), evidence concerning their intellectual profile remains scarce. The present study examined the results of the administration of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition to 301 adults diagnosed with SLDs and compared them to the results obtained from previous studies with a large sample of children with SLDs. The results showed that: (1) as observed among children, adults with SLDs also presented higher scores in the subtests implying reasoning (associated with the General Ability Index, GAI) and lower scores in the subtests involving working memory and processing speed; (2) the discrepancy between full-scale IQ and the GAI had a good predictive value in discriminating adults with and without SLDs; (3) the four-factor hierarchical structure of intelligence proposed for the general adult population held for adults with SLDs as well, even though there were substantial differences in the loadings and a five-factor structure could be more appropriate; (4) similarities as well as strong differences were present between adults and children with SLDs. In adults, scores on subtests were generally lower, particularly in working memory and processing speed. However, in some cases, scores were equal or even higher (as in the "Similarity" subtest) among adults, meaning that the discrepancy between the full scale and the GAI was accentuated.

Abstract: There is an emerging consensus that numerical, executive function (EF), and spatial skills are foundational to children's mathematical learning and development. Moreover, each skill has been theorized to relate to mathematics for different reasons. Thus, it is possible that each cognitive construct is related to mathematics through distinct pathways. The present study tests this hypothesis. One-hundred and eighty 4- to 9-year-olds (M(age) = 6.21) completed a battery of numerical, EF, spatial, and mathematics measures. Factor analyses revealed strong, but separable, relations between children's numerical, EF, and spatial skills. Moreover, the three-factor model (i.e., modelling numerical, EF, and spatial skills as separate latent variables) fit the data better than a general intelligence (g-factor) model. While EF skills were the only unique predictor of number line performance, spatial skills were the only unique predictor of arithmetic (addition) performance. Additionally, spatial skills were related to the use of more advanced addition strategies (e.g., composition/decomposition and retrieval), which in turn were related to children's overall arithmetic performance. That is, children's strategy use fully mediated the relation between spatial skills and arithmetic performance. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the cognitive foundations of early mathematics, with implications for assessment and instruction moving forward.

Abstract: The advancement of medical prognoses hinges on the delivery of timely and reliable assessments. Conventional methods of assessments and diagnosis, often reliant on human expertise, lead to inconsistencies due to professionals' subjectivity, knowledge, and experience. To address these problems head-on, we harnessed artificial intelligence's power to introduce a transformative solution. We leveraged convolutional neural networks to engineer our SCOLIONET architecture, which can accurately identify Cobb angle measurements. Empirical testing on our pipeline demonstrated a mean segmentation accuracy of 97.50% (Sorensen-Dice coefficient) and 96.30% (Intersection over Union), indicating the model's proficiency in outlining vertebrae. The level of quantification accuracy was attributed to the state-of-the-art design of the atrous spatial pyramid pooling to better segment images. We also compared physician's manual evaluations against our machine driven measurements to validate our approach's practicality and reliability further. The results were remarkable, with a p-value (t-test) of 0.1713 and an average acceptable deviation of 2.86 degrees, suggesting insignificant difference between the two methods. Our work holds the premise of enabling medical practitioners to expedite scoliosis examination swiftly and consistently in improving and advancing the quality of patient care.
