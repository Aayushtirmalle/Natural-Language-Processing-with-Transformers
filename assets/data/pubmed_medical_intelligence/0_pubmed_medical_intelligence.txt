Abstract: Subtle degenerative tears that so commonly involve the upper third of the subscapularis are oftentimes missed. However, there are physical examination, imaging, and arthroscopic findings that are highly suggestive of subscapularis tearing. Positive belly-press and bear hug tests, a thinner and longer subscapularis tendon, subscapularis muscle, belly loss of bulk or fatty infiltration, narrow coracohumeral distance, and biceps pathology are indicative. Artificial intelligence-based predictive algorithms can estimate the likelihood of subscapularis tearing based on a combined analysis of these and other features. Improved outcomes should logically be expected for those shoulders with subscapularis tears that are identified and repaired. Finally, some research suggests that debridement remains an alternative to repair; however, pending future research, debridement is not the author's preferred treatment.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov 17
Abstract: Subscapularis pathology is difficult to diagnose, in part because of decreased sensitivity and accuracy in identifying tears with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when compared to other cuff tendons. Artificial intelligence evaluation of patient physical examination and MRI data using a machine learning model shows that arthroscopically confirmed partial- or full-thickness subscapularis tears are highly associated with abnormal subscapularis tendon length, long head of the biceps tears, and subscapularis fatty atrophy, and on physical examination, with weakness with internal rotation and positive lift-off, belly press, and bear hug tests. Today, physicians may use machine learning as a tool, but this model may not currently be sufficient to drastically change practice. However, with continued research and development, which is occurring rapidly, similar models could aid physicians in timely identification of pathology and optimization of preoperative planning, as well as physician training and education.

Title: Pre-Processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for electrocardiogram (ECG) signals analysis: A comprehensive review.
Author: ['Safdar MF', 'Nowak RM', 'Palka P']
Journal Title: Computers in biology and medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 29
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) are the physiological signals and a standard test to measure the heart's electrical activity that depicts the movement of cardiac muscles. A review study has been conducted on ECG signals analysis with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) methods over the last ten years i.e., 2012-22. Primarily, the method of ECG analysis by software systems was divided into classical signal processing (e.g. spectrograms or filters), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including recursive models, transformers and hybrid. Secondly, the data sources and benchmark datasets were depicted. Authors grouped resources by ECG acquisition methods into hospital-based portable machines and wearable devices. Authors also included new trends like advanced pre-processing, data augmentation, simulations and agent-based modeling. The study found improvement in ECG examination perfection made each year through ML, DL, hybrid models, and transformers. Convolutional neural networks and hybrid models were more targeted and proved efficient. The transformer model extended the accuracy from 90% to 98%. The Physio-Net library helps acquire ECG signals, including the popular benchmark databases such as MIT-BIH, PTB, and challenging datasets. Similarly, wearable devices have been established as a appropriate option for monitoring patient health without the time and place limitations and are also helpful for AI model calibration with so far accuracy of 82%-83% on Samsung smartwatch. In the pre-processing signals, spectrogram generation through Fourier and wavelet transformations are erected leading approaches promoting on average accuracy of 90%-95%. Likewise, data enhancement using geometrical techniques is well-considered; however, extraction and concatenation-based methods need attention. As the what-if analysis in healthcare or cardiac issues can be performed using a complex simulation, the study reviews agent-based modeling and simulation approaches for cardiovascular risk event assessment.

Title: New perspectives on cancer clinical research in the era of big data and machine learning.
Author: ['Li S', 'Yi H', 'Leng Q', 'Wu Y', 'Mao Y']
Journal Title: Surgical oncology
Publication Date: 2023 Oct 16
Abstract: In the 21st century, the development of medical science has entered the era of big data, and machine learning has become an essential tool for mining medical big data. The establishment of the SEER database has provided a wealth of epidemiological data for cancer clinical research, and the number of studies based on SEER and machine learning has been growing in recent years. This article reviews recent research based on SEER and machine learning and finds that the current focus of such studies is primarily on the development and validation of models using machine learning algorithms, with the main directions being lymph node metastasis prediction, distant metastasis prediction, and prognosis-related research. Compared to traditional models, machine learning algorithms have the advantage of stronger adaptability, but also suffer from disadvantages such as overfitting and poor interpretability, which need to be weighed in practical applications. At present, machine learning algorithms, as the foundation of artificial intelligence, have just begun to emerge in the field of cancer clinical research. The future development of oncology will enter a more precise era of cancer research, characterized by larger data, higher dimensions, and more frequent information exchange. Machine learning is bound to shine brightly in this field.

Title: GANcMRI: Cardiac magnetic resonance video generation and physiologic guidance using latent space prompting.
Author: ['Vukadinovic M', 'Kwan AC', 'Li D', 'Ouyang D']
Journal Title: Proceedings of machine learning research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence can be applied to medical imaging on tasks such as privacy-preserving image generation and superresolution and denoising of existing images. Few prior approaches have used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) as a modality given the complexity of videos (the addition of the temporal dimension) as well as the limited scale of publicly available datasets. We introduce GANcMRI, a generative adversarial network that can synthesize cMRI videos with physiological guidance based on latent space prompting. GANcMRI uses a StyleGAN framework to learn the latent space from individual video frames and leverages the timedependent trajectory between end-systolic and end-diastolic frames in the latent space to predict progression and generate motion over time. We proposed various methods for modeling latent time-dependent trajectories and found that our Frame-to-frame approach generates the best motion and video quality. GANcMRI generated high-quality cMRI image frames that are indistinguishable by cardiologists, however, artifacts in video generation allow cardiologists to still recognize the difference between real and generated videos. The generated cMRI videos can be prompted to apply physiologybased adjustments which produces clinically relevant phenotypes recognizable by cardiologists. GANcMRI has many potential applications such as data augmentation, education, anomaly detection, and preoperative planning.

Title: Evaluation of breast tumor morphologies from African American and Caucasian patients.
Author: ['Stone A', 'Kalahiki C', 'Li L', 'Hubig N', 'Iuricich F', 'Dunn H']
Journal Title: Computational and structural biotechnology journal
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The primary aim of this research was to investigate potential differences of breast tumor morphologies across African American and Caucasian racial groups by utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. While breast cancer disparities can partially be attributed to social determinants of health, tumor biology also contributes to survival outcomes. The rate of breast tumor growth is largely dependent on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Current research suggests the cellular components of the ECM may vary among racial and ethnic populations, and this may contribute to the incidence of cancer in African Americans. We utilized a supervised AI method to evaluate morphological differences between African American and Caucasian breast cancer tumors. Images used for analysis were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) biorepository stored in the NIH Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal. We designed an ML classifier using the AlexNet model provided in PyTorch's torchvision package. The model was pre-trained and adapted via transfer learning resulting in a classification accuracy of 92.1% when using our breast cancer tumor image database split into 80% of training set and 20% of testing set. We interpreted the results of the AlexNet and ResNet50 models using LIME and saliency mapping as the explainers. Based on the images from our bi-racial testing set, this study confirmed significant variations of tumor and ECM regions in the different racial groups evaluated. Based on these findings, further analysis and characterization may provide new insight into disparities associated with the incidence of breast cancer.

Journal Title: Computational and structural biotechnology journal
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: A cross-ribosome binding site (cRBS) adjusts the dynamic range of transcription factor-based biosensors (TFBs) by controlling protein expression and folding. The rational design of a cRBS with desired TFB dynamic range remains an important issue in TFB forward and reverse engineering. Here, we report a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based forward-reverse engineering platform for TFB dynamic range prediction and de novo cRBS design with selected TFB dynamic ranges. The platform demonstrated superior in processing unbalanced minority-class datasets and was guided by sequence characteristics from trained cRBSs. The platform identified correlations between cRBSs and dynamic ranges to mimic bidirectional design between these factors based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN) with a gradient penalty (GP) (WGAN-GP) and balancing GAN with GP (BAGAN-GP). For forward and reverse engineering, the predictive accuracy was up to 98% and 82%, respectively. Collectively, we generated an AI-based method for the rational design of TFBs with desired dynamic ranges.

Journal Title: Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Irrespective of men and women, colorectal cancer (CRC), is the third most common cancer in the population with more than 1.85 million cases annually. Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI.

Abstract: Cardiogenic shock (CS) may have a negative impact on mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Early prediction of CS can result in improved survival. Artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in predictive medicine. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of these models in the early prediction of CS. A thorough search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was conducted from the time of inception until November 2, 2023, to find relevant studies. Our outcomes were area under the curve (AUC), the sensitivity and specificity of the ML model, the accuracy of the ML model, and the predictor variables that had the most impact in predicting CS. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3.0 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Six studies were considered in our study. The pooled mean AUC was 0.808 (95% confidence interval: 0.727, 0.890). The AUC in the included studies ranged from 0.77 to 0.91. ML models performed well, with accuracy ranging from 0.88 to 0.93 and sensitivity and specificity of 58%-78% and 88%-93%, respectively. Age, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood glucose were the most significant variables required by ML models to acquire their outputs. In conclusion, AI has the potential for early prediction of CS, which may lead to a decrease in the high mortality rate associated with it. Future studies are needed to confirm the results.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to report early outcomes of integrating Hypotension Prediction Index-guided hemodynamic management within a cardiac enhanced recovery pathway on total initial ventilation hours and length of stay in the intensive care unit. METHODS: A multicenter, historical control, observational analysis of implementation of a hemodynamic management tool within enhanced recovery pathways was conducted by identifying cardiac surgery cases from 3 sites during 2 time periods, August 1 to December 31, 2019 (preprogram), and April 1 to August 31, 2021 (program). Reoperations, emergency (salvage), or cases requiring mechanical assist were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and chart reviews. Two primary outcome variables were length of stay in the intensive care unit (using Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions) and acute kidney injury (using modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria). One secondary outcome variable, total initial ventilation hours, used Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions. Differences in length of stay in the intensive care unit and total ventilation time were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Acute kidney injury stage used chi-square and stepwise cumulative logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1404 cases (795 preprogram; 609 program) were identified. Overall reductions of 6.8 and 4.4 hours in intensive care unit length of stay (P = .08) and ventilation time (P = .03) were found, respectively. No significant association between proportion of patients identified with acute kidney injury by stage and period was found. CONCLUSIONS: Adding artificial intelligence-guided hemodynamic management to cardiac enhanced recovery pathways resulted in associated reduced time in the intensive care unit for patients undergoing nonemergency cardiac surgery across institutions in a real-world setting.

Title: Emotional Intelligence, Academic Motivation, and Achievement among Health Science Students in Saudi Arabia: A Self-Deterministic Approach.
Author: ['Mahrous RM', 'Bugis BA', 'Sayed SH']
Journal Title: Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: PURPOSE: This study used a self-deterministic approach to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI), academic motivation (AM), and achievement among health science students. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in three cities of Saudi Arabia (Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah). A convenience sample of 450 students was incorporated using the multistage cluster sampling technique. The online survey contained three sections: students' basic data and academic achievement level, the modified Schutte self-report inventory, and the Academic Motivation Scale lowercase. RESULTS: This study revealed moderate overall scores for EI (57.1%), AM (55.6%), and grade point average (GPA) (57.6%). The overall EI score, its domains, and GPA had significant positive correlations with overall AM and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (p < .01). Amotivation had an insignificant correlation with GPA (p < .05), but it was negatively correlated with EI and its domains (p < .01). Multiple regression analysis proved that EI domains predicted 5.0% of GPA variance; emotions appraisal and expression (beta = .02, p = .024), regulation (beta = .11, p = .032), and utilization (beta = .24, p < .01). EI domains also predicted 26.0% of AM variance; emotions appraisal and expression (beta = .11, p = .04), regulation (beta = .33, p < .01), and utilization (beta = .23, p <.01). Moreover, AM predicted 4.0% of the variance in GPA; intrinsic (beta = .25, p = .004) and extrinsic (beta = .11, p = .022) motivation. AM also predicted 25.0% of the variance in EI: intrinsic (beta = .34, p < .01) and extrinsic motivation (beta = .26, p = .026). CONCLUSION: EI and AM have a bidirectional influence on each other, significantly shaping the GPA of health sciences students in Saudi Arabia, where intrinsic motivation has a predominant role. Thus, promoting students' AM and EI is recommended to foster their academic achievement.

Abstract: Accurate staging of bladder cancer assists in identifying optimal treatment (e.g., transurethral resection vs. radical cystectomy vs. bladder preservation). However, currently, about one-third of patients are over-staged and one-third are under-staged. There is a pressing need for a more accurate staging modality to evaluate patients with bladder cancer to assist clinical decision-making. We hypothesize that MRI/RNA-seq-based radiogenomics and artificial intelligence can more accurately stage bladder cancer. A total of 40 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were available for analysis. Twenty-eight (28) MRI and their matched FFPE tissues were available for training analysis, and 12 matched MRI and FFPE tissues were used for validation. FFPE samples were subjected to bulk RNA-seq, followed by bioinformatics analysis. In the radiomics, several hundred image-based features from bladder tumors in MRI were extracted and analyzed. Overall, the model obtained mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 94%, 88%, and 92%, respectively, in differentiating intra- vs. extra-bladder cancer. The proposed model demonstrated improvement in the three matrices by 17%, 33%, and 25% and 17%, 16%, and 17% as compared to the genetic- and radiomic-based models alone, respectively. The radiogenomics of bladder cancer provides insight into discriminative features capable of more accurately staging bladder cancer. Additional studies are underway.

Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 31
Abstract: In recent years, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged, combining edge computing with AI, and specifically deep learning, to run AI algorithms directly on edge devices. In practical applications, EI faces challenges related to computational power, power consumption, size, and cost, with the primary challenge being the trade-off between computational power and power consumption. This has rendered traditional computing platforms unsustainable, making heterogeneous parallel computing platforms a crucial pathway for implementing EI. In our research, we leveraged the Xilinx Zynq 7000 heterogeneous computing platform, employed high-level synthesis (HLS) for design, and implemented two different accelerators for LeNet-5 using loop unrolling and pipelining optimization techniques. The experimental results show that when running at a clock speed of 100 MHz, the PIPELINE accelerator, compared to the UNROLL accelerator, experiences an 8.09% increase in power consumption but speeds up by 14.972 times, making the PIPELINE accelerator superior in performance. Compared to the CPU, the PIPELINE accelerator reduces power consumption by 91.37% and speeds up by 70.387 times, while compared to the GPU, it reduces power consumption by 93.35%. This study provides two different optimization schemes for edge intelligence applications through design and experimentation and demonstrates the impact of different quantization methods on FPGA resource consumption. These experimental results can provide a reference for practical applications, thereby providing a reference hardware acceleration scheme for edge intelligence applications.

Abstract: In today's digitalized era, the usage of Android devices is being extensively witnessed in various sectors. Cybercriminals inevitably adapt to new security technologies and utilize these platforms to exploit vulnerabilities for nefarious purposes, such as stealing users' sensitive and personal data. This may result in financial losses, discredit, ransomware, or the spreading of infectious malware and other catastrophic cyber-attacks. Due to the fact that ransomware encrypts user data and requests a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key, it is one of the most devastating types of malicious software. The implications of ransomware attacks can range from a loss of essential data to a disruption of business operations and significant monetary damage. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, namely machine learning (ML), have proven to be notable in the detection of Android ransomware attacks. However, ensemble models and deep learning (DL) models have not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, in this study, we utilized ML- and DL-based techniques to build efficient, precise, and robust models for binary classification. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle consisting of 392,035 records with benign traffic and 10 different types of Android ransomware attacks was used to train and test the models. Two experiments were carried out. In experiment 1, all the features of the dataset were used. In experiment 2, only the best 19 features were used. The deployed models included a decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble of (DT, SVM, and KNN), feedforward neural network (FNN), and tabular attention network (TabNet). Overall, the experiments yielded excellent results. DT outperformed the others, with an accuracy of 97.24%, precision of 98.50%, and F1-score of 98.45%. Whereas, in terms of the highest recall, SVM achieved 100%. The acquired results were thoroughly discussed, in addition to addressing limitations and exploring potential directions for future work.
