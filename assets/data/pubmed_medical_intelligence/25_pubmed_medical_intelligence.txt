Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Given the importance of rigorous development and evaluation standards needed of artificial intelligence (AI) models used in health care, nationwide accepted procedures to provide assurance that the use of AI is fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe are urgently needed. OBSERVATIONS: While there are several efforts to develop standards and best practices to evaluate AI, there is a gap between having such guidance and the application of such guidance to both existing and new AI models being developed. As of now, there is no publicly available, nationwide mechanism that enables objective evaluation and ongoing assessment of the consequences of using health AI models in clinical care settings. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The need to create a public-private partnership to support a nationwide health AI assurance labs network is outlined here. In this network, community best practices could be applied for testing health AI models to produce reports on their performance that can be widely shared for managing the lifecycle of AI models over time and across populations and sites where these models are deployed.

Title: Extranodal extension in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: need for accurate pretherapeutic staging to select optimum treatment and minimize toxicity.
Author: ['Bradley PJ']
Journal Title: Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In 2017, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) introduced the inclusion of extracapsular nodal extension (ENE) into the N staging of nonviral head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), while retaining the traditional N classification based on the number and sizes of metastatic nodes. The extent of ENE was further defined as microscopic ENE (ENEmi) and major ENE (ENEma) based on extent of disease beyond the nodal capsule (</= or > 2 mm). This article reviews the evidence and progress made since these changes were introduced. RECENT FINDINGS: The 'gold standard' for evaluation ENE is histopathologic examination, the current preferred primary treatment of patients with HNSCC is by radiation-based therapy +/- chemotherapy or biotherapy. The current pretreatment staging is by imaging, which needs improved reliability of radiologic rENE assessment with reporting needs to consider both sensitivity and specificity (currently computed tomography images have high-specificity but low-sensitivity). Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for patients with ENEma to enhance disease control, whereas for patients with ENEmi, there is a need to assess the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence that the presence of pENE in HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma is an independent prognostic factor and should be considered for inclusion in future AJCC editions has recently emerged. SUMMARY: There remains a paucity of data on the reliability of imaging in the staging of rENE, more so the for the accurate assessment of ENEmi. Optimistic early results from use of artificial intelligence/deep learning demonstrate progress and may pave the way for better capabilities in tumor staging, treatment outcome prediction, resulting in improved survival outcomes.

Author: ['Zawiah M', 'Al-Ashwal FY', 'Gharaibeh L', 'Abu Farha R', 'Alzoubi KH', 'Abu Hammour K', 'Qasim QA', 'Abrah F']
Journal Title: Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The emergence of Chat-Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) by OpenAI has revolutionized AI technology, demonstrating significant potential in healthcare and pharmaceutical education, yet its real-world applicability in clinical training warrants further investigation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2023 to assess PharmD students' perceptions, concerns, and experiences regarding the integration of ChatGPT into clinical pharmacy education. The study utilized a convenient sampling method through online platforms and involved a questionnaire with sections on demographics, perceived benefits, concerns, and experience with ChatGPT. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, including descriptive and inferential analyses. RESULTS: The findings of the study involving 211 PharmD students revealed that the majority of participants were male (77.3%), and had prior experience with artificial intelligence (68.2%). Over two-thirds were aware of ChatGPT. Most students (n= 139, 65.9%) perceived potential benefits in using ChatGPT for various clinical tasks, with concerns including over-reliance, accuracy, and ethical considerations. Adoption of ChatGPT in clinical training varied, with some students not using it at all, while others utilized it for tasks like evaluating drug-drug interactions and developing care plans. Previous users tended to have higher perceived benefits and lower concerns, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Utilizing ChatGPT in clinical training offers opportunities, but students' lack of trust in it for clinical decisions highlights the need for collaborative human-ChatGPT decision-making. It should complement healthcare professionals' expertise and be used strategically to compensate for human limitations. Further research is essential to optimize ChatGPT's effective integration.

Title: Finding Ideal Parameters for Recycled Material Fused Particle Fabrication-Based 3D Printing Using an Open Source Software Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization.
Author: ['Oberloier S', 'Whisman NG', 'Pearce JM']
Journal Title: 3D printing and additive manufacturing
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: As additive manufacturing rapidly expands the number of materials including waste plastics and composites, there is an urgent need to reduce the experimental time needed to identify optimized printing parameters for novel materials. Computational intelligence (CI) in general and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms in particular have been shown to accelerate finding optimal printing parameters. Unfortunately, the implementation of CI has been prohibitively complex for noncomputer scientists. To overcome these limitations, this article develops, tests, and validates PSO Experimenter, an easy-to-use open-source platform based around the PSO algorithm and applies it to optimizing recycled materials. Specifically, PSO Experimenter is used to find optimal printing parameters for a relatively unexplored potential distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) material that is widely available: low-density polyethylene (LDPE). LDPE has been used to make filament, but in this study for the first time it was used in the open source fused particle fabrication/fused granular fabrication system. PSO Experimenter successfully identified functional printing parameters for this challenging-to-print waste plastic. The results indicate that PSO Experimenter can provide 97% reduction in research time for 3D printing parameter optimization. It is concluded that the PSO Experimenter is a user-friendly and effective free software for finding ideal parameters for the burgeoning challenge of DRAM as well as a wide range of other fields and processes.

Journal Title: Autism in adulthood : challenges and management
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: Vocational programs typically focus on building the skills of autistic youth. However, there is growing recognition that the supportive environment (or ecosystem) around an individual plays an important role in finding and maintaining work. Programs at the ecosystem-level can be established by coordinating support before high school ends. Cocreation of a vocational program by support providers can facilitate an integrated effort to prepare autistic youth for employment. In this study, we describe and evaluate the Job-Train Program (JTP), a vocational program for autistic high school students codesigned with educators and a community-based social services agency. A school board, community-based social services agency, and academics partnered to cocreate JTP. JTP combined skill teaching and paid supported employment on a university campus. This pilot study evaluated JTP using qualitative and quantitative data. Twelve autistic youth were recruited, aged 15-18 years (10 males, 2 females) with an average intelligence quotient of 101.9 (standard deviation = 14.4), from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-2. Youth and parents completed self-report measures (pre-post), including the primary outcome, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). Post-JTP, interviews, focus groups, and surveys collected additional information from youth (n = 11), parents (n = 10), job coaches (n = 5), and employers (n = 8). Youth COPM scores indicated significant improvements in self-perceived ratings of skill performance (z = -2.5, p = 0.01) and satisfaction (z = -2.6, p = 0.01). Qualitative data corroborated COPM results noting youth skill improvements in self-esteem, independence, communication, and understanding work. Findings demonstrated a promising vocational training model for autistic high school students informing the development of integrated service pathways to support preparation for employment.

Author: ['Xavier D', 'Miyawaki I', 'Campello Jorge CA', 'Freitas Silva GB', 'Lloyd M', 'Moraes F', 'Patel B', 'Batalini F']
Journal Title: Journal of medical screening
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Deep learning (DL) has shown promising results for improving mammographic breast cancer diagnosis. However, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the breast cancer screening process has not yet been fully elucidated in terms of potential workload reduction. We aim to assess if AI-based triaging of breast cancer screening mammograms could reduce the radiologist's workload with non-inferior sensitivity. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies that evaluated AI algorithms on computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms. We extracted data from homogenous studies and performed a proportion meta-analysis with a random-effects model to examine the radiologist's workload reduction (proportion of low-risk mammograms that could be theoretically ruled out from human's assessment) and the software's sensitivity to breast cancer detection. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected for full review, and three studies that used the same commercially available DL algorithm were included in the meta-analysis. In the 156,852 examinations included, the threshold of 7 was identified as optimal. With these parameters, radiologist workload decreased by 68.3% (95%CI 0.655-0.711, I(2) = 98.76%, p < 0.001), while achieving a sensitivity of 93.1% (95%CI 0.882-0.979, I(2) = 83.86%, p = 0.002) and a specificity of 68.7% (95% CI 0.684-0.723, I(2) = 97.5%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The deployment of DL computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms reduces the radiology workload while maintaining high sensitivity. Although the implementation of AI remains complex and heterogeneous, it is a promising tool to optimize healthcare resources.

Title: Automated data analysis of unstructured grey literature in health research: A mapping review.
Author: ['Schmidt L', 'Mohamed S', 'Meader N', 'Bacardit J', 'Craig D']
Journal Title: Research synthesis methods
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: The amount of grey literature and 'softer' intelligence from social media or websites is vast. Given the long lead-times of producing high-quality peer-reviewed health information, this is causing a demand for new ways to provide prompt input for secondary research. To our knowledge, this is the first review of automated data extraction methods or tools for health-related grey literature and soft data, with a focus on (semi)automating horizon scans, health technology assessments (HTA), evidence maps, or other literature reviews. We searched six databases to cover both health- and computer-science literature. After deduplication, 10% of the search results were screened by two reviewers, the remainder was single-screened up to an estimated 95% sensitivity; screening was stopped early after screening an additional 1000 results with no new includes. All full texts were retrieved, screened, and extracted by a single reviewer and 10% were checked in duplicate. We included 84 papers covering automation for health-related social media, internet fora, news, patents, government agencies and charities, or trial registers. From each paper, we extracted data about important functionalities for users of the tool or method; information about the level of support and reliability; and about practical challenges and research gaps. Poor availability of code, data, and usable tools leads to low transparency regarding performance and duplication of work. Financial implications, scalability, integration into downstream workflows, and meaningful evaluations should be carefully planned before starting to develop a tool, given the vast amounts of data and opportunities those tools offer to expedite research.

Journal Title: The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ureteral injury is common during gynaecological laparoscopic surgery. Real-time auto-segmentation can assist gynaecologists in identifying the ureter and reduce intraoperative injury risk. METHODS: A deep learning segmentation model was crafted for ureter recognition in surgical videos, utilising 3368 frames from 11 laparoscopic surgeries. Class activation maps enhanced the model's interpretability, showing its areas. The model's clinical relevance was validated through an End-User Turing test and verified by three gynaecological surgeons. RESULTS: The model registered a Dice score of 0.86, a Hausdorff 95 distance of 22.60, and processed images in 0.008 s on average. In complex surgeries, it pinpointed the ureter's position in real-time. Fifty five surgeons across eight institutions found the model's accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity comparable to human performance. Yet, artificial intelligence experience influenced some subjective ratings. CONCLUSIONS: The model offers precise real-time ureter segmentation in laparoscopic surgery and can be a significant tool for gynaecologists to mitigate ureteral injuries.

Author: ['Africano G', 'Arponen O', 'Rinta-Kiikka I', 'Pertuz S']
Journal Title: Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some researchers have questioned whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems maintain their performance when used for women from populations not considered during the development of the system. PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of transfer learning as a way of improving the generalization of AI systems in the detection of breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective case-control Finnish study involved 191 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 191 matched healthy controls. We selected a state-of-the-art AI system for breast cancer detection trained using a large US dataset. The selected baseline system was evaluated in two experimental settings. First, we examined our private Finnish sample as an independent test set that had not been considered in the development of the system (unseen population). Second, the baseline system was retrained to attempt to improve its performance in the unseen population by means of transfer learning. To analyze performance, we used areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong's test. RESULTS: Two versions of the baseline system were considered: ImageOnly and Heatmaps. The ImageOnly and Heatmaps versions yielded mean AUC values of 0.82+/-0.008 and 0.88+/-0.003 in the US dataset and 0.56 (95% CI=0.50-0.62) and 0.72 (95% CI=0.67-0.77) when evaluated in the unseen population, respectively. The retrained systems achieved AUC values of 0.61 (95% CI=0.55-0.66) and 0.69 (95% CI=0.64-0.75), respectively. There was no statistical difference between the baseline system and the retrained system. CONCLUSION: Transfer learning with a small study sample did not yield a significant improvement in the generalization of the system.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy, hereinafter referred to as "cerebral palsy", refers to a non progressive injury that occurs during the development of brain tissue in fetuses or infants. The patients often have walking dysfunction, abnormal balance ability and abnormal body stability, which are mainly caused by Cranial nerves injury. PATIENT CONCERNS: One child diagnosed with ataxia cerebral palsy by the hospital was recruited, aged 6 years and 9 months. The symptoms were: lower limb adduction and internal rotation, left neck tilt to the left due to insufficient muscle tension, and eyes squint to the right. The movement is clumsy and the coordination ability of limbs is poor; Its body balance function is poor, the sitting and standing position cannot keep the body upright and balanced for a long time, and the coordination of the random movement of hands and eyes is poor; Weak spatial cognition and orientation ability; Have persistent central motor dysfunction. When walking, the body leans forward and sideways, and the gait is staggered, which is easy to fall; In terms of expression, it shows vague language and unclear speech; Relatively retarded in intelligence. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION: The study used swimming training intervention to report a twelve months training intervention program for a child with ataxic cerebral palsy, and evaluated it with Berg balance scale and modified Ashworth scale. OUTCOMES: Swimming training has a significant effect on the rehabilitation of children with ataxic cerebral palsy; The forces from different directions in the water can improve the balance of children with cerebral palsy; Muscle endurance training with medium load intensity can help restore unilateral muscle tension deficiency to a certain extent, and make bilateral muscle tension gradually becomes.consistent, thus enhancing the balance ability, gait and body stability of children with cerebral palsy.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics in healthcare heralds a new era of medical innovation, promising enhanced diagnostics, streamlined processes, and improved patient care. However, this technological revolution is accompanied by intricate ethical implications that demand meticulous consideration. This article navigates the complex ethical terrain surrounding AI and robotics in healthcare, delving into specific dimensions and providing strategies and best practices for ethical navigation. Privacy and data security are paramount concerns, necessitating robust encryption and anonymization techniques to safeguard patient data. Responsible data handling practices, including decentralized data sharing, are critical to preserve patient privacy. Algorithmic bias poses a significant challenge, demanding diverse datasets and ongoing monitoring to ensure fairness. Transparency and explainability in AI decision-making processes enhance trust and accountability. Clear responsibility frameworks are essential to address the accountability of manufacturers, healthcare institutions, and professionals. Ethical guidelines, regularly updated and accessible to all stakeholders, guide decision-making in this dynamic landscape. Moreover, the societal implications of AI and robotics extend to accessibility, equity, and societal trust. Strategies to bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable access must be prioritized. Global collaboration is pivotal in developing adaptable regulations and addressing legal challenges like liability and intellectual property. Ethics must remain at the forefront in the ever-evolving realm of healthcare technology. By embracing these strategies and best practices, healthcare systems and professionals can harness the potential of AI and robotics, ensuring responsible and ethical integration that benefits patients while upholding the highest ethical standards.

Title: The impact of digital healthcare and teledentistry on dentistry in the 21st Century: a survey of Hungarian dentists.
Author: ['Nemeth O', 'Uhrin E', 'Girasek E', 'Boros J', 'Gyorffy Z']
Journal Title: BMC oral health
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The era of digitalization has arrived in the field of dentistry. Teledentistry (TD), the use of digital solutions in dentistry, is already used in practice; however, only some possibilities are considered. During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote patient monitoring and patient communication had to be solved with TD, thus causing a rapid spread of new tools. In addition to digital workflows, patient communication, AI, and online forums are also available. METHODS: An online self-administered survey was developed for the study. The Hungarian Medical Chamber contacted potential respondents in a newsletter or e-mail. The Evasys survey system was used. The weighting procedure was executed for gender, age group, and type of settlement. A digital dental index variable was created and built with a linear regression model as a dependent variable. Explanatory variables are advantages, disadvantages, what would be necessary, experienced needs from the patients, and age. RESULTS: A total of 171 dentists completed the survey. The best-known digital technologies are online conferences (96.5%), E-prescriptions (94.6%), and digital impressions (86.0%). Unawareness is the highest in the field of artificial intelligence in dentistry (50.5%), store-forward solutions (43.5%), and real-time solutions (41.8%). The digital dental index is 14.24 (standard deviation (SD) = 5.5), with a high power of the model. CONCLUSION: Hungarian dentists need to be made aware of all the possibilities of TD. In addition to digital workflows, store-forward and real-time solutions can be beneficial to substitute face-to-face visits. TD can be used effectively to monitor oral cavity changes and develop dental confidence and proper oral care habits. Our survey suggests that it is necessary and inevitable to integrate TD into both graduate and postgraduate education, which may form the basis of primary health care in the next decade.

Title: Effect of empathy competence on moral sensitivity in Chinese student nurses: the mediating role of emotional intelligence.
Author: ['Liu F', 'Zhou H', 'Yuan L', 'Cai Y']
Journal Title: BMC nursing
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ethical issues may pose challenges to nursing students entering clinical practice. Moral sensitivity can assist them in recognising existing moral situations and then taking adequate action. Identifying the variables associated with moral sensitivity may be useful in preparing to improve nursing students' moral sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated empathy, emotional intelligence, and moral sensitivity in Chinese student nurses to explore the association among these three factors and to verify the mediating function of emotional intelligence in determining the connection between empathy and moral sensitivity. DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional correlational design. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Through convenience sampling, 239 fourth-year nursing undergraduates at a university in Western China were enrolled in this study. METHODS: Nursing students who volunteered to participate in the study completed self-reported scales on empathy, emotional intelligence, and moral sensitivity between September and October 2022. The potential mediating effect was explored using the Process Macro and bootstrap method. RESULTS: The nursing students' average scores were 39.62 +/- 5.27 on moral sensitivity, 108.21 +/- 15.49 on empathy, and 124.41 +/- 13.66 on EI. Moral sensitivity was positively correlated with emotional intelligence (r = 0.454, p < 0.001) and empathy (r = 0.545, p < 0.001). Furthermore, empathy exerted a substantial direct effect on nursing students' moral sensitivity (B = 0.1424, p < 0.001). Emotional intelligence could mediate the indirect path from empathy to moral sensitivity. (B = 0.0372, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Emotional intelligence mediated the association between empathy and moral sensitivity. Thus, educational activities and programmes placing an emphasis on empathy and emotional intelligence may offer an alternative way to promote moral sensitivity in Chinese student nurses. IMPLICATIONS: Nursing educators can organise programmes to improve nursing students' emotional competence and professional values. Early exposure to clinical practice benefits nursing students a lot in terms of building interactions with patients and increasing emotional resonance. In addition, nursing educators should develop situational teaching in nursing ethics courses to help students cope with ethical issues.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Acute Appendicitis: A Systematic Review of Diagnostic and Prognostic Models.
Author: ['Issaiy M', 'Zarei D', 'Saghazadeh A']
Journal Title: World journal of emergency surgery : WJES
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) models in diagnosing and prognosticating acute appendicitis (AA) in adult patients compared to traditional methods. AA is a common cause of emergency department visits and abdominal surgeries. It is typically diagnosed through clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and inaccurate. Machine learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting outcomes. MAIN BODY: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, searching PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies were evaluated for risk of bias using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Data points extracted included model type, input features, validation strategies, and key performance metrics. RESULTS: In total, 29 studies were analyzed, out of which 21 focused on diagnosis, seven on prognosis, and one on both. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were the most commonly employed algorithm for diagnosis. Both ANN and logistic regression were also widely used for categorizing types of AA. ANNs showed high performance in most cases, with accuracy rates often exceeding 80% and AUC values peaking at 0.985. The models also demonstrated promising results in predicting postoperative outcomes such as sepsis risk and ICU admission. Risk of bias was identified in a majority of studies, with selection bias and lack of internal validation being the most common issues. CONCLUSION: AI algorithms demonstrate significant promise in diagnosing and prognosticating AA, often surpassing traditional methods and clinical scores such as the Alvarado scoring system in terms of speed and accuracy.

Title: Acceptance and use of a clinical decision support system in musculoskeletal pain disorders - the SupportPrim project.
Author: ['Granviken F', 'Meisingset I', 'Vasseljen O', 'Bach K', 'Bones AF', 'Klevanger NE']
Journal Title: BMC medical informatics and decision making
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We have developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on methods from artificial intelligence to support physiotherapists and patients in the decision-making process of managing musculoskeletal (MSK) pain disorders in primary care. The CDSS finds the most similar successful patients from the past to give treatment recommendations for a new patient. Using previous similar patients with successful outcomes to advise treatment moves management of MSK pain patients from one-size fits all recommendations to more individually tailored treatment. This study aimed to summarise the development and explore the acceptance and use of the CDSS for MSK pain patients. METHODS: This qualitative study was carried out in the Norwegian physiotherapy primary healthcare sector between October and November 2020, ahead of a randomised controlled trial. We included four physiotherapists and three of their patients, in total 12 patients, with musculoskeletal pain in the neck, shoulder, back, hip, knee or complex pain. We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with all participants. The interviews were analysed using the Framework Method. RESULTS: Overall, both the physiotherapists and patients found the system acceptable and usable. Important findings from the analysis of the interviews were that the CDSS was valued as a preparatory and exploratory tool, facilitating the therapeutic relationship. However, the physiotherapists used the system mainly to support their previous and current practice rather than involving patients to a greater extent in decisions and learning from previous successful patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CDSS was acceptable and usable to both the patients and physiotherapists. However, the system appeared not to considerably influence the physiotherapists' clinical reasoning and choice of treatment based on information from most similar successful patients. This could be due to a smaller than optimal number of previous patients in the CDSS or insufficient clinical implementation. Extensive training of physiotherapists should not be underestimated to build understanding and trust in CDSSs.

Title: Enhancing domain generalization in the AI-based analysis of chest radiographs with federated learning.
Author: ['Tayebi Arasteh S', 'Kuhl C', 'Saehn MJ', 'Isfort P', 'Truhn D', 'Nebelung S']
Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Developing robust artificial intelligence (AI) models that generalize well to unseen datasets is challenging and usually requires large and variable datasets, preferably from multiple institutions. In federated learning (FL), a model is trained collaboratively at numerous sites that hold local datasets without exchanging them. So far, the impact of training strategy, i.e., local versus collaborative, on the diagnostic on-domain and off-domain performance of AI models interpreting chest radiographs has not been assessed. Consequently, using 610,000 chest radiographs from five institutions across the globe, we assessed diagnostic performance as a function of training strategy (i.e., local vs. collaborative), network architecture (i.e., convolutional vs. transformer-based), single versus cross-institutional performance (i.e., on-domain vs. off-domain), imaging finding (i.e., cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, pneumonia, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, and no abnormality), dataset size (i.e., from n = 18,000 to 213,921 radiographs), and dataset diversity. Large datasets not only showed minimal performance gains with FL but, in some instances, even exhibited decreases. In contrast, smaller datasets revealed marked improvements. Thus, on-domain performance was mainly driven by training data size. However, off-domain performance leaned more on training diversity. When trained collaboratively across diverse external institutions, AI models consistently surpassed models trained locally for off-domain tasks, emphasizing FL's potential in leveraging data diversity. In conclusion, FL can bolster diagnostic privacy, reproducibility, and off-domain reliability of AI models and, potentially, optimize healthcare outcomes.

Title: GAHLS: an optimized graph analytics based high level synthesis framework.
Author: ['Xiao Y', 'Nazarian S', 'Bogdan P']
Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: The urgent need for low latency, high-compute and low power on-board intelligence in autonomous systems, cyber-physical systems, robotics, edge computing, evolvable computing, and complex data science calls for determining the optimal amount and type of specialized hardware together with reconfigurability capabilities. With these goals in mind, we propose a novel comprehensive graph analytics based high level synthesis (GAHLS) framework that efficiently analyzes complex high level programs through a combined compiler-based approach and graph theoretic optimization and synthesizes them into message passing domain-specific accelerators. This GAHLS framework first constructs a compiler-assisted dependency graph (CaDG) from low level virtual machine (LLVM) intermediate representation (IR) of high level programs and converts it into a hardware friendly description representation. Next, the GAHLS framework performs a memory design space exploration while account for the identified computational properties from the CaDG and optimizing the system performance for higher bandwidth. The GAHLS framework also performs a robust optimization to identify the CaDG subgraphs with similar computational structures and aggregate them into intelligent processing clusters in order to optimize the usage of underlying hardware resources. Finally, the GAHLS framework synthesizes this compressed specialized CaDG into processing elements while optimizing the system performance and area metrics. Evaluations of the GAHLS framework on several real-life applications (e.g., deep learning, brain machine interfaces) demonstrate that it provides 14.27x performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as LegUp 6.2.

Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of AI-based conversational agents for promoting mental health and well-being.
Author: ['Li H', 'Zhang R', 'Lee YC', 'Kraut RE', 'Mohr DC']
Journal Title: NPJ digital medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Conversational artificial intelligence (AI), particularly AI-based conversational agents (CAs), is gaining traction in mental health care. Despite their growing usage, there is a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of their impact on mental health and well-being. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs' effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge's g 0.64 [95% CI 0.17-1.12]) and distress (Hedge's g 0.7 [95% CI 0.18-1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge's g 0.32 [95% CI -0.13 to 0.78]). User experience with AI-based CAs was largely shaped by the quality of human-AI therapeutic relationships, content engagement, and effective communication. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based CAs in addressing mental health issues. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of their effectiveness, assess long-term effects across various mental health outcomes, and evaluate the safe integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, encompassing machine learning and deep learning, can assist ophthalmologists in early detection of various ocular abnormalities through the analysis of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Despite considerable progress in these algorithms, several limitations persist in medical imaging fields, where a lack of data is a common issue. Accordingly, specific image processing techniques, such as time-frequency transforms, can be employed in conjunction with AI algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This research investigates the influence of non-data-adaptive time-frequency transforms, specifically X-lets, on the classification of OCT B-scans. For this purpose, each B-scan was transformed using every considered X-let individually, and all the sub-bands were utilized as the input for a designed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract optimal features, which were subsequently fed to the classifiers. Evaluating per-class accuracy shows that the use of the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT) yields superior outcomes for normal cases, whereas the circlet transform outperforms other X-lets for abnormal cases characterized by circles in their retinal structure (due to the accumulation of fluid). As a result, we propose a novel transform named CircWave by concatenating all sub-bands from the 2D-DWT and the circlet transform. The objective is to enhance the per-class accuracy of both normal and abnormal cases simultaneously. Our findings show that classification results based on the CircWave transform outperform those derived from original images or any individual transform. Furthermore, Grad-CAM class activation visualization for B-scans reconstructed from CircWave sub-bands highlights a greater emphasis on circular formations in abnormal cases and straight lines in normal cases, in contrast to the focus on irrelevant regions in original B-scans. To assess the generalizability of our method, we applied it to another dataset obtained from a different imaging system. We achieved promising accuracies of 94.5% and 90% for the first and second datasets, respectively, which are comparable with results from previous studies. The proposed CNN based on CircWave sub-bands (i.e. CircWaveNet) not only produces superior outcomes but also offers more interpretable results with a heightened focus on features crucial for ophthalmologists.
