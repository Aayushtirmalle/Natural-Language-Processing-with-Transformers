Abstract: In the early 2000s, the introduction of single-camera wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) redefined small bowel study. Progress continued with the development of double-camera devices, first for the colon and rectum, and then, for panenteric assessment. Advancements continued with magnetic capsule endoscopy (MCE), particularly when assisted by a robotic arm, designed to enhance gastric evaluation. Indeed, as CE provides full visualization of the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a minimally invasive capsule panendoscopy (CPE) could be a feasible alternative, despite its time-consuming nature and learning curve, assuming appropriate bowel cleansing has been carried out. Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for CE auxiliary reading (detecting and diagnosing), may provide the missing link in fulfilling the goal of establishing the use of panendoscopy, although prospective studies are still needed to validate these models in actual clinical scenarios. Recent CE advancements will be discussed, focusing on the current evidence on CNN developments, and their real-life implementation potential and associated ethical challenges.

Abstract: The importance of detecting and preventing ovarian cancer is of utmost significance for women's overall health and wellness. Referred to as the "silent killer," ovarian cancer exhibits inconspicuous symptoms during its initial phases, posing a challenge for timely identification. Identification of ovarian cancer during its advanced stages significantly diminishes the likelihood of effective treatment and survival. Regular screenings, such as pelvic exams, ultrasound, and blood tests for specific biomarkers, are essential tools for detecting the disease in its early, more treatable stages. This research makes use of the Soochow University ovarian cancer dataset, containing 50 features for the accurate detection of ovarian cancer. The proposed predictive model makes use of a stacked ensemble model, merging the strengths of bagging and boosting classifiers, and aims to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability. This combination harnesses the benefits of variance reduction and improved generalization, contributing to superior ovarian cancer prediction outcomes. The proposed model gives 96.87% accuracy, which is currently the highest model result obtained on this dataset so far using all features. Moreover, the outcomes are elucidated utilizing the explainable artificial intelligence method referred to as SHAPly. The excellence of the suggested model is demonstrated through a comparison of its performance with that of other cutting-edge models.

Abstract: PURPOSE: When autocontouring based on artificial intelligence (AI) is used in the radiotherapy (RT) workflow, the contours are reviewed and eventually adjusted by a radiation oncologist before an RT treatment plan is generated, with the purpose of improving dosimetry and reducing both interobserver variability and time for contouring. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of application of a commercial AI-based autocontouring for RT, assessing both geometric accuracies and the influence on optimized dose from automatically generated contours after review by human operator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial autocontouring system was applied to a retrospective database of 40 patients, of which 20 were treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PCa) and 20 for head and neck cancer (HNC). Contours resulting from AI were compared against AI contours reviewed by human operator and human-only contours using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and relative volume difference (RVD). Dosimetric indices such as D(mean), D(0.03cc), and normalized plan quality metrics were used to compare dose distributions from RT plans generated from structure sets contoured by humans assisted by AI against plans from manual contours. The reduction in contouring time obtained by using automated tools was also assessed. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was computed to assess the significance of differences. Interobserver variability of the comparison of manual vs. AI-assisted contours was also assessed among two radiation oncologists for PCa. RESULTS: For PCa, AI-assisted segmentation showed good agreement with expert radiation oncologist structures with average DSC among patients >/= 0.7 for all structures, and minimal radiation oncology adjustment of structures (DSC of adjusted versus AI structures >/= 0.91). For HNC, results of comparison between manual and AI contouring varied considerably e.g., 0.77 for oral cavity and 0.11-0.13 for brachial plexus, but again, adjustment was generally minimal (DSC of adjusted against AI contours 0.97 for oral cavity, 0.92-0.93 for brachial plexus). The difference in dose for the target and organs at risk were not statistically significant between human and AI-assisted, with the only exceptions of D(0.03cc) to the anal canal and D(mean) to the brachial plexus. The observed average differences in plan quality for PCa and HNC cases were 8% and 6.7%, respectively. The dose parameter changes due to interobserver variability in PCa were small, with the exception of the anal canal, where large dose variations were observed. The reduction in time required for contouring was 72% for PCa and 84% for HNC. CONCLUSIONS: When an autocontouring system is used in combination with human review, the time of the RT workflow is significantly reduced without affecting dose distribution and plan quality.

Abstract: This study examined the associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) and children's neuropsychological outcomes at 3 to 5 years of age. A total of 379 women and their children from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study participated. Covariate-adjusted robust regressions examined associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG class, interaction terms, and child outcomes. Each unit increase in maternal BMI was linked to a 0.48-point decrement (95% CI: -0.75 to -0.21) in children's Full Scale IQ. Higher pre-pregnancy BMI was related to poorer performance on the other intelligence indexes (B = -0.35 to -0.47, 95% CIs: -0.75, -0.02) and lower performance on measures of language (B = -0.08 to -0.09, 95% CIs: -0.16, -0.02), motor skills (B = -0.08 to -0.11, 95% CIs: -0.18, -0.01), and executive function (B = -0.09 to -0.16, 95% CIs: -0.26, -0.01). GWG below the recommended range was associated with a 4.04-point decrement (95% CI: 7.89, -0.11) in Full Scale IQ, but better performance on a spatial working memory test (B = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.52). GWG above the recommended range was associated with lower language (B = -0.79, 95% CI: -1.52, -0.06) and memory scores (B = -0.93, 95% CI: -1.64, -0.22). Interactions were found between pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG on measures of intelligence and executive function. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG are related to children's performance in various neuropsychological domains and may interact to predict outcomes. Optimizing maternal health and weight prior to conception and during pregnancy may enhance children's neuropsychological outcomes.

Abstract: Bone segmentation and 3D reconstruction are crucial for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgical planning with Personalized Surgical Instruments (PSIs). Traditional semi-automatic approaches are time-consuming and operator-dependent, although they provide reliable outcomes. Moreover, the recent expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) tools towards various medical domains is transforming modern healthcare. Accordingly, this study introduces an automated AI-based pipeline to replace the current operator-based tibia and femur 3D reconstruction procedure enhancing TKA preoperative planning. Leveraging an 822 CT image dataset, a novel patch-based method and an improved segmentation label generation algorithm were coupled to a Combined Edge Loss UNet (CEL-UNet), a novel CNN architecture featuring an additional decoding branch to boost the bone boundary segmentation. Root Mean Squared Errors and Hausdorff distances compared the predicted surfaces to the reference bones showing median and interquartile values of 0.26 (0.19-0.36) mm and 0.24 (0.18-0.32) mm, and of 1.06 (0.73-2.15) mm and 1.43 (0.82-2.86) mm for the tibia and femur, respectively, outperforming previous results of our group, state-of-the-art, and UNet models. A feasibility analysis for a PSI-based surgical plan revealed sub-millimetric distance errors and sub-angular alignment uncertainties in the PSI contact areas and the two cutting planes. Finally, operational environment testing underscored the pipeline's efficiency. More than half of the processed cases complied with the PSI prototyping requirements, reducing the overall time from 35 min to 13.1 s, while the remaining ones underwent a manual refinement step to achieve such PSI requirements, performing the procedure four to eleven times faster than the manufacturer standards. To conclude, this research advocates the need for real-world applicability and optimization of AI solutions in orthopedic surgical practice.

Journal Title: Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative planning for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial. Computed tomography (CT)-based preoperative planning offers more comprehensive information and can also be used to design patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), but it requires well-reconstructed and segmented images, and the process is complex and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) preoperative planning and PSI system for TKA and to validate its time savings and accuracy in clinical applications. METHODS: The 3D-UNet and modified HRNet neural network structures were used to develop the AI preoperative planning and PSI system (AIJOINT). Forty-two patients who were scheduled for TKA underwent both AI and manual CT processing and planning for component sizing, 20 of whom had their PSIs designed and applied intraoperatively. The time consumed and the size and orientation of the postoperative component were recorded. RESULTS: The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and loss function indicated excellent performance of the neural network structure in CT image segmentation. AIJOINT was faster than conventional methods for CT segmentation (3.74 +/- 0.82 vs. 128.88 +/- 17.31 min, p < 0.05) and PSI design (35.10 +/- 3.98 vs. 159.52 +/- 17.14 min, p < 0.05) without increasing the time for size planning. The accuracy of AIJOINT in planning the size of both femoral and tibial components was 92.9%, while the accuracy of the conventional method in planning the size of the femoral and tibial components was 42.9% and 47.6%, respectively (p < 0.05). In addition, AI-based PSI improved the accuracy of the hip-knee-ankle angle and reduced postoperative blood loss (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: AIJOINT significantly reduces the time needed for CT processing and PSI design without increasing the time for size planning, accurately predicts the component size, and improves the accuracy of lower limb alignment in TKA patients, providing a meaningful supplement to the application of AI in orthopaedics.

Title: Simulation and Optimization: A New Direction in Supercritical Technology Based Nanomedicine.
Author: ['Huang Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Lu X', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou D', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu G']
Journal Title: Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: In recent years, nanomedicines prepared using supercritical technology have garnered widespread research attention due to their inherent attributes, including structural stability, high bioavailability, and commendable safety profiles. The preparation of these nanomedicines relies upon drug solubility and mixing efficiency within supercritical fluids (SCFs). Solubility is closely intertwined with operational parameters such as temperature and pressure while mixing efficiency is influenced not only by operational conditions but also by the shape and dimensions of the nozzle. Due to the special conditions of supercriticality, these parameters are difficult to measure directly, thus presenting significant challenges for the preparation and optimization of nanomedicines. Mathematical models can, to a certain extent, prognosticate solubility, while simulation models can visualize mixing efficiency during experimental procedures, offering novel avenues for advancing supercritical nanomedicines. Consequently, within the framework of this endeavor, we embark on an extensive review encompassing the application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques within the medical domain of supercritical technology. We undertake the synthesis and discourse of methodologies for calculating drug solubility in SCFs, as well as the influence of operational conditions and experimental apparatus upon the outcomes of nanomedicine preparation using supercritical technology. Through this comprehensive review, we elucidate the implementation procedures and commonly employed models of diverse methodologies, juxtaposing the merits and demerits of these models. Furthermore, we assert the dependability of employing models to compute drug solubility in SCFs and simulate the experimental processes, with the capability to serve as valuable tools for aiding and optimizing experiments, as well as providing guidance in the selection of appropriate operational conditions. This, in turn, fosters innovative avenues for the development of supercritical pharmaceuticals.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine in the last few years highlights the importance of developing bigger and better systems for data and model sharing. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical data poses a challenge when it comes to sharing. One potential solution to mitigate the risk of PHI breaches is to exclusively share pre-trained models developed using private datasets. Despite the availability of these pre-trained networks, there remains a need for an adaptable environment to test and fine-tune specific models tailored for clinical tasks. This environment should be open for peer testing, feedback, and continuous model refinement, allowing dynamic model updates that are especially important in the medical field, where diseases and scanning techniques evolve rapidly. In this context, the Discovery Viewer (DV) platform was developed in-house at the Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Institute at Mount Sinai (BMEII) to facilitate the creation and distribution of cutting-edge medical AI models that remain accessible after their development. The all-in-one platform offers a unique environment for non-AI experts to learn, develop, and share their own deep learning (DL) concepts. This paper presents various use cases of the platform, with its primary goal being to demonstrate how DV holds the potential to empower individuals without expertise in AI to create high-performing DL models. We tasked three non-AI experts to develop different musculoskeletal AI projects that encompassed segmentation, regression, and classification tasks. In each project, 80% of the samples were provided with a subset of these samples annotated to aid the volunteers in understanding the expected annotation task. Subsequently, they were responsible for annotating the remaining samples and training their models through the platform's "Training Module". The resulting models were then tested on the separate 20% hold-off dataset to assess their performance. The classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.94, a sensitivity of 0.92, and a specificity of 1. The regression model yielded a mean absolute error of 14.27 pixels. And the segmentation model attained a Dice Score of 0.93, with a sensitivity of 0.9 and a specificity of 0.99. This initiative seeks to broaden the community of medical AI model developers and democratize the access of this technology to all stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the transition of medical AI models from research to clinical settings.

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhages require an immediate diagnosis to optimize patient management and outcomes, and CT is the modality of choice in the emergency setting. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the first scanner-integrated artificial intelligence algorithm to detect brain hemorrhages in a routine clinical setting. This retrospective study includes 435 consecutive non-contrast head CT scans. Automatic brain hemorrhage detection was calculated as a separate reconstruction job in all cases. The radiological report (RR) was always conducted by a radiology resident and finalized by a senior radiologist. Additionally, a team of two radiologists reviewed the datasets retrospectively, taking additional information like the clinical record, course, and final diagnosis into account. This consensus reading served as a reference. Statistics were carried out for diagnostic accuracy. Brain hemorrhage detection was executed successfully in 432/435 (99%) of patient cases. The AI algorithm and reference standard were consistent in 392 (90.7%) cases. One false-negative case was identified within the 52 positive cases. However, 39 positive detections turned out to be false positives. The diagnostic performance was calculated as a sensitivity of 98.1%, specificity of 89.7%, positive predictive value of 56.7%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.7%. The execution of scanner-integrated AI detection of brain hemorrhages is feasible and robust. The diagnostic accuracy has a high specificity and a very high negative predictive value and sensitivity. However, many false-positive findings resulted in a relatively moderate positive predictive value.

Abstract: This perspective is an overview of the recent advances in teeth microcrack (MC) research, where there is a clear tendency towards a shift from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) examination techniques, enhanced with artificial intelligence models for data processing and image acquisition. X-ray micro-computed tomography combined with machine learning allows 3D characterization of all spatially resolved cracks, despite the locations within the tooth in which they begin and extend, and the arrangement of MCs and their structural properties. With photoluminescence and micro-/nano-Raman spectroscopy, optical properties and chemical and elemental composition of the material can be evaluated, thus helping to assess the structural integrity of the tooth at the MC site. Approaching tooth samples having cracks from different perspectives and using complementary laboratory techniques, there is a natural progression from 3D to multi-modal imaging, where the volumetric (passive: dimensions) information of the tooth sample can be supplemented by dynamic (active: composition, interaction) image data. Revelation of tooth cracks clearly shows the need to re-assess the role of these MCs and their effect on the structural integrity and longevity of the tooth. This provides insight into the nature of cracks in natural hard materials and contributes to a better understanding of how bio-inspired structures could be designed to foresee crack propagation in biosolids.

Abstract: The mechanism underlying anorectal malformations (ARMs)-related VACTERL (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheo-esophageal fistula, and renal and limb abnormalities) remains unclear. Copy number variation (CNV) contributed to VACTERL pathogenicity. Here, we report a novel CNV in 8p23 and 12q23.1 identified in a case of ARMs-related VACTERL association. This 12-year-old girl presented a cloaca (urethra, vagina, and rectum opening together and sharing a single tube length), an isolated kidney, and a perpetuation of the left superior vena cava at birth. Her intelligence, growth, and development were slightly lower than those of normal children of the same age. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a 9.6-Mb deletion in 8p23.1-23.3 and a 0.52-Mb duplication in 12q23.1 in her genome. Furthermore, we reviewed the cases involving CNVs in patients with VACTERL, 8p23 deletion, and 12q23.1 duplication, and our case was the first displaying ARMs-related VACTERL association with CNV in 8p23 and 12q23.1. These findings enriched our understanding between VACTERL association and the mutations of 8p23 deletion and 12q23.1 duplication. IMPACT: This is a novel case of a Chinese girl with anorectal malformations (ARMs)-related VACTERL with an 8p23.1-23.3 deletion and 12q23.1 duplication. Cloaca malformation is presented with novel copy number variation in 8p23.1-23.3 deletion and 12q23.1 duplication.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The rising global cancer burden has led to an increasing demand for imaging tests such as [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET-CT. To aid imaging specialists in dealing with high scan volumes, we aimed to train a deep learning artificial intelligence algorithm to classify [(18)F]FDG-PET-CT scans of patients with lymphoma with or without hypermetabolic tumour sites. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis we collected 16 583 [(18)F]FDG-PET-CTs of 5072 patients with lymphoma who had undergone PET-CT before or after treatment at the Memorial Sloa Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. Using maximum intensity projection (MIP), three dimensional (3D) PET, and 3D CT data, our ResNet34-based deep learning model (Lymphoma Artificial Reader System [LARS]) for [(18)F]FDG-PET-CT binary classification (Deauville 1-3 vs 4-5), was trained on 80% of the dataset, and tested on 20% of this dataset. For external testing, 1000 [(18)F]FDG-PET-CTs were obtained from a second centre (Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). Seven model variants were evaluated, including MIP-based LARS-avg (optimised for accuracy) and LARS-max (optimised for sensitivity), and 3D PET-CT-based LARS-ptct. Following expert curation, areas under the curve (AUCs), accuracies, sensitivities, and specificities were calculated. FINDINGS: In the internal test cohort (3325 PET-CTs, 1012 patients), LARS-avg achieved an AUC of 0.949 (95% CI 0.942-0.956), accuracy of 0.890 (0.879-0.901), sensitivity of 0.868 (0.851-0.885), and specificity of 0.913 (0.899-0.925); LARS-max achieved an AUC of 0.949 (0.942-0.956), accuracy of 0.868 (0.858-0.879), sensitivity of 0.909 (0.896-0.924), and specificity of 0.826 (0.808-0.843); and LARS-ptct achieved an AUC of 0.939 (0.930-0.948), accuracy of 0.875 (0.864-0.887), sensitivity of 0.836 (0.817-0.855), and specificity of 0.915 (0.901-0.927). In the external test cohort (1000 PET-CTs, 503 patients), LARS-avg achieved an AUC of 0.953 (0.938-0.966), accuracy of 0.907 (0.888-0.925), sensitivity of 0.874 (0.843-0.904), and specificity of 0.949 (0.921-0.960); LARS-max achieved an AUC of 0.952 (0.937-0.965), accuracy of 0.898 (0.878-0.916), sensitivity of 0.899 (0.871-0.926), and specificity of 0.897 (0.871-0.922); and LARS-ptct achieved an AUC of 0.932 (0.915-0.948), accuracy of 0.870 (0.850-0.891), sensitivity of 0.827 (0.793-0.863), and specificity of 0.913 (0.889-0.937). INTERPRETATION: Deep learning accurately distinguishes between [(18)F]FDG-PET-CT scans of lymphoma patients with and without hypermetabolic tumour sites. Deep learning might therefore be potentially useful to rule out the presence of metabolically active disease in such patients, or serve as a second reader or decision support tool.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Several artificial intelligence (AI) systems for diabetic retinopathy screening have been validated but there is limited evidence on their performance in real-world settings. This study aimed to assess the performance of an AI software deployed within the diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Dominica. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional clinical validation study. Patients with diabetes aged 18 years and above attending the diabetic retinopathy screening in primary care facilities in Dominica from 5 June to 3 July 2021 were enrolled.Grading was done at the point of care by the field grader, followed by counselling and referral to the eye clinic. Images were then graded by an AI system. Sensitivity, specificity with 95% CIs and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for comparing the AI to field grader as gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 587 participants were screened. The AI had a sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy of 77.5% and 91.5% compared with the grader, for all participants, including ungradable images. The AUC was 0.8455. Excluding 52 participants deemed ungradable by the grader, the AI had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and 91.5%, with an AUC of 0.9648. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that AI has the potential to be deployed to assist a diabetic screening programme in a middle-income real-world setting and perform with reasonable accuracy compared with a specialist grader.

Journal Title: BMJ open ophthalmology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: PURPOSE: To develop a Vision Transformer model to detect different stages of diabetic maculopathy (DM) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. METHODS: After removing images with poor quality, a total of 3319 OCT images were extracted from the Eye Center of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and randomly split the images into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. All macular cross-sectional scan OCT images were collected retrospectively from the eyes of DM patients from 2016 to 2022. One of the OCT stages of DM, including early diabetic macular oedema (DME), advanced DME, severe DME and atrophic maculopathy, was labelled on the collected images, respectively. A deep learning (DL) model based on Vision Transformer was trained to detect four OCT grading of DM. RESULTS: The model proposed in our paper can provide an impressive detection performance. We achieved an accuracy of 82.00%, an F1 score of 83.11%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96. The AUC for the detection of four OCT grading (ie, early DME, advanced DME, severe DME and atrophic maculopathy) was 0.96, 0.95, 0.87 and 0.98, respectively, with an accuracy of 90.87%, 89.96%, 94.42% and 95.13%, respectively, a precision of 88.46%, 80.31%, 89.42% and 87.74%, respectively, a sensitivity of 87.03%, 88.18%, 63.39% and 89.42%, respectively, a specificity of 93.02%, 90.72%, 98.40% and 96.66%, respectively and an F1 score of 87.74%, 84.06%, 88.18% and 88.57%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our DL model based on Vision Transformer demonstrated a relatively high accuracy in the detection of OCT grading of DM, which can help with patients in a preliminary screening to identify groups with serious conditions. These patients need a further test for an accurate diagnosis, and a timely treatment to obtain a good visual prognosis. These results emphasised the potential of artificial intelligence in assisting clinicians in developing therapeutic strategies with DM in the future.

Abstract: Lipolysis is an essential metabolic process that releases unesterified fatty acids from neutral lipid stores to maintain energy homeostasis in living organisms. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) plays a key role in intracellular lipolysis and can be co-activated upon interaction with the protein comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58). The underlying molecular mechanism of ATGL stimulation by CGI-58 is incompletely understood. Based on analysis of evolutionary conservation, we used site directed mutagenesis to study a C-terminally truncated variant and full-length mouse ATGL providing insights in the protein co-activation on a per-residue level. We identified the region from residues N209-N215 in ATGL as essential for co-activation by CGI-58. ATGL variants with amino-acids exchanges in this region were still able to hydrolyze triacylglycerol at the basal level and to interact with CGI-58, yet could not be activated by CGI-58. Our studies also demonstrate that full-length mouse ATGL showed higher tolerance to specific single amino acid exchanges in the N209-N215 region upon CGI-58 co-activation compared to C-terminally truncated ATGL variants. The region is either directly involved in protein-protein interaction or essential for conformational changes required in the co-activation process. Three-dimensional models of the ATGL/CGI-58 complex with the artificial intelligence software AlphaFold demonstrated that a large surface area is involved in the protein-protein interaction. Mapping important amino acids for co-activation of both proteins, ATGL and CGI-58, onto the 3D model of the complex locates these essential amino acids at the predicted ATGL/CGI-58 interface thus strongly corroborating the significance of these residues in CGI-58 mediated co-activation of ATGL.

Journal Title: Annals of hepatology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), defined by the presence of liver steatosis together with at least one out of five cardiometabolic factors, is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, affecting around one in three people. Yet the clinical presentation of MASLD and the risk of progression to cirrhosis and adverse clinical outcomes is highly variable. It therefore represents both a global public health threat and a precision medicine challenge. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is being investigated in MASLD to develop reproducible, quantitative, and automated methods to enhance patient stratification and to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in MASLD. This review details the different applications of AI and Machine Learning Algorithms in MASLD, particularly in the context of analyzing electronic health record, digital pathology, and imaging data. Additionally, it also describes how specific MASLD consortia are leveraging multimodal data sources to spark research breakthroughs in the field. Using a new national level 'data commons' (SteatoSITE) as an exemplar, the opportunities as well as the technical challenges of large-scale databases in MASLD research are highlighted.

Abstract: The discipline of cardiology stands at a transformative juncture, primarily influenced by the surge in digital health technologies. These innovations hold the promise to redefine the realms of cardiovascular research and patient care, ushering in an era of individualized and data-driven treatments. This review delves into the heart of this evolution, introducing a comprehensive design for the future of cardiology. Emphasizing the emerging domains of "digitalomics" and "digital intervention", it explores how the integration of patient data, artificial intelligence-enabled diagnostics, and telehealth can lead to more streamlined and personalized cardiovascular health. The "digital-twin" model, a highlight of this approach, encapsulates individual patient characteristics, allowing for targeted treatments. The role of interdisciplinary collaboration in cardiovascular medicine is also underlined, emphasizing the importance of merging traditional cardiology with technological advancements. The convergence of traditional cardiology methods and digital health technologies, facilitated by a transdisciplinary approach, is set to chart a new course in cardiovascular health, emphasizing individualized care and improved clinical outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Understanding the factors that lead to relapse is a major challenge for the clinical support of smoking cessation. Neurocognitive abilities such as attention, executive functioning and working memory, are possible predictors of relapse and can be easily assessed in everyday clinical practice. In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relationship between pre-smoking cessation neurocognitive performance and relapse at six months in a sample of patients being treated for their tobacco dependence. METHODS: 130 tobacco consumers were included in the study. They completed a comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical assessment before smoking cessation. The targeted abilities were intelligence, inhibition, shifting, working memory updating, verbal fluency and decision-making. RESULTS: The rate of tobacco relapse at 6 months was 58%. Logistic regressions were used to assess which variables best explained relapse. None of the neuropsychological tests was a significant predictor of relapse at either 1, 3 or 6 months, either alone, or controlling for other covariates acting as significant predictors of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Common neuropsychological tests, even those specifically targeting executive functioning such as inhibition, are not useful predictors of the success of a smoking cessation program in a clinical setting. Other variables, such as motivation to quit smoking or the presence of comorbid depression or anxiety disorders, appear to be more useful predictors of relapse.
