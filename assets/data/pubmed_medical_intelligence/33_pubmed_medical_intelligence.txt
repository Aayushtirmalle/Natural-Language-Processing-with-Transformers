Abstract: INTRODUCTION:  Advancements within the field of medicine revolve around increasing the efficiency of diagnosing and subsequently treating patients. One such advancement is measurements of the central canal using artificial intelligence (AI). The authors propose the possibility of AI measuring two linear distances followed by a subsequent approximation via an area equation. The lumbar spinal canal was approximated by an area calculation using the interpedicular distance (IPD) and anteroposterior diameter (AP diameter). The three shapes evaluated were an ellipse, triangle, and rectangle. METHODS:  IPD, AP diameter, and spinal canal area from L1-L5 were measured in 555 patients using the IMPAX6 (Mortsel, Belgium: Agfa-Gevaert) picture archiving and communication system. Subsequently, an approximated area of the lumbar spinal canal, assuming an ellipse shape, was calculated using ellipse equation/approximation. Triangular and rectangular approximations were done using triangle equation/approximation and rectangle equation/approximation, respectively. The equations used are the geometric equations for the area of each shape described. For example, the triangular approximation used the IPD as the base of the triangle and the AP diameter as the height. Thus, the area approximation was calculated by half of the IPD times the AP diameter. RESULTS:  The percent error of the ellipse approximation was the lowest with a range of error from 8.44% at L1 to 15.51% at L5. The triangle approximation again was the second most accurate with a range of error starting at -26.46% at L5 to -30.96% at L1. Lastly, the percentage errors of the rectangle approximation began at 38.07% at L1 to 47.07% at L5. The ellipse and rectangle approximation consistently overestimated the area of the spinal canal, while the opposite was true for the triangle approximation. A combination of these approximations could be used to construct a second-order approximation. The approximations were all highly correlated with the authors' manual measurements. Approximations at the L2 vertebrae were highest with a correlation of 0.934 closely followed by all approximations at L5 with a value of 0.931. Approximations were least correlated with the L4 vertebrae with a value of 0.905. CONCLUSION: The correlation between the approximation equations and the measured values is significantly related. The ellipse equation best predicted the area of the spinal canal followed by the triangle and then the rectangle approximation. The percent error difference of the ellipse approximation at L1 was similar in error compared to other causes of measurement error. Continued investigation into a second-order approximation may yield a more accurate approximation.

Author: ['Sana M', 'Farooq MU', 'Anwar S', 'Haber R']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: In this modern era where Industry 4.0, plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity, quality, and resource utilization by digitalizing and providing smart operation to industrial systems. Therefore, there is a need to establish a framework that enhances productivity and quality of work to achieve the net-zero from industry. In this study, a comprehensive and generic analytical framework has been established to mitigate or lessen the research and technological gap in the manufacturing sector. In addition to that, the key stages involved in artificial intelligence (AI) based modelling and optimization analysis for manufacturing systems have also been incorporated. To assess the proposed AI framework, electric discharge machining (EDM) as a case study has been selected. The focus enlightens the emergence of optimizing the material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR) for Inconel 617 (IN617) material. A full factorial design of the experiment was carried out for experimentation. After that, an artificial neural network (ANN) as a modelling framework is selected, and fine-tuning of hyperparameters during training has been carried out. To validate the predictive performance of the trained models, an external validation (Val(ext)) test has been conducted. Through sensitivity analysis (SA) on the developed AI framework, the most influential factors affecting MRR and SR in EDM have been identified. Specifically, powder concentration (C(p)) contributes the most to the percentage significance, accounting for 79.00 % towards MRR, followed by treatment (16.35 %) and 4.67 % surfactant concentration (S(c)). However, the highest % significance in SR is given by S(c) (36.86 %), followed by C(p) (33.23 %), and then treatment (29.90 %), respectively. Furthermore, a parametric optimization has been performed using the framework and found that MRR and SR are 93.75 % and 58.90 % better than experimental data. This successful performance optimization proposed by the framework has the potential for application to other manufacturing systems.

Abstract: The global cost-benefit analysis of pesticide use during the last 30 years has been characterized by a significant increase during the period from 1990 to 2007 followed by a decline. This observation can be attributed to several factors including, but not limited to, pest resistance, lack of novelty with respect to modes of action or classes of chemistry, and regulatory action. Due to current and projected increases of the global population, it is evident that the demand for food, and consequently, the usage of pesticides to improve yields will increase. Addressing these challenges and needs while promoting new crop protection agents through an increasingly stringent regulatory landscape requires the development and integration of infrastructures for innovative, cost- and time-effective discovery and development of novel and sustainable molecules. Significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and cheminformatics over the last two decades have improved the decision-making power of research scientists in the discovery of bioactive molecules. AI- and cheminformatics-driven molecule discovery offers the opportunity of moving experiments from the greenhouse to a virtual environment where thousands to billions of molecules can be investigated at a rapid pace, providing unbiased hypothesis for lead generation, optimization, and effective suggestions for compound synthesis and testing. To date, this is illustrated to a far lesser extent in the publicly available agrochemical research literature compared to drug discovery. In this review, we provide an overview of the crop protection discovery pipeline and how traditional, cheminformatics, and AI technologies can help to address the needs and challenges of agrochemical discovery towards rapidly developing novel and more sustainable products.

Author: ['Wijerathne T', 'Sari DK', 'Liyanage T', 'Kumaranayake R', 'Adithya D']
Journal Title: Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: PURPOSE: Participation in regular physical activity is influenced by a variety of factors, including psychological dimensions. Emotional intelligence (EI), an emerging term, has not yet been extensively researched in relation to Physical Activity (PA). Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between EI on the PA of university undergraduates. METHODS: Cross sectional design was used to conduct the study. A total of 400 Colombo district state university undergraduates were included in the sample. The participants filled out two standard questionnaires. Wong and Low questionnaire to measure EI and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ- Long Form) to measure physical activity. Convenience sampling has been used in order to collect the data. SPSS 25.0 software was used to process and analyze the data with Spearman's test and Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: The rate of significance is 0.061 and as it is greater than 0.05 and the test results are not significant, the null hypothesis was accepted, and the hypothesis was rejected. At the same time, there was a weak negative correlation between EI and PA, which was statistically not significant - rs = - 0.094, p = 0.061. CONCLUSION: It is crucial to emphasize and put into practice the need for undergraduates to engage in more PA. The findings provide a basis for research aimed at determining the relationship between EI and PA.

Title: Can AI Think Like a Plastic Surgeon? Evaluating GPT-4's Clinical Judgment in Reconstructive Procedures of the Upper Extremity.
Author: ['Leypold T', 'Schafer B', 'Boos A', 'Beier JP']
Journal Title: Plastic and reconstructive surgery. Global open
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: This study delves into the potential application of OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) in plastic surgery, with a particular focus on procedures involving the hand and arm. GPT-4, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) model known for its advanced chat interface, was tested on nine surgical scenarios of varying complexity. To optimize the performance of GPT-4, prompt engineering techniques were used to guide the model's responses and improve the relevance and accuracy of its output. A panel of expert plastic surgeons evaluated the responses using a Likert scale to assess the model's performance, based on five distinct criteria. Each criterion was scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing the highest possible score. GPT-4 demonstrated a high level of performance, achieving an average score of 4.34 across all cases, consistent across different complexities. The study highlights the ability of GPT-4 to understand and respond to complicated surgical scenarios. However, the study also identifies potential areas for improvement. These include refining the prompts used to elicit responses from the model and providing targeted training with specialized, up-to-date sources. This study demonstrates a new approach to exploring large language models and highlights potential future applications of AI. These could improve patient care, refine surgical outcomes, and even change the way we approach complex clinical scenarios in plastic surgery. However, the intrinsic limitations of AI in its current state, together with the potential ethical considerations and the inherent uncertainty of unanticipated issues, serve to reiterate the indispensable role and unparalleled value of human plastic surgeons.

Title: AI in Rehabilitation Medicine: Opportunities and Challenges.
Author: ['Lanotte F', "O'Brien MK", 'Jayaraman A']
Journal Title: Annals of rehabilitation medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly able to learn from larger and more complex data, thus allowing clinicians and scientists to gain new insights from the information they collect about their patients every day. In rehabilitation medicine, AI can be used to find patterns in huge amounts of healthcare data. These patterns can then be leveraged at the individual level, to design personalized care strategies and interventions to optimize each patient's outcomes. However, building effective AI tools requires many careful considerations about how we collect and handle data, how we train the models, and how we interpret results. In this perspective, we discuss some of the current opportunities and challenges for AI in rehabilitation. We first review recent trends in AI for the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and continuous monitoring of disease or injury, with a special focus on the different types of healthcare data used for these applications. We then examine potential barriers to designing and integrating AI into the clinical workflow, and we propose an end-to-end framework to address these barriers and guide the development of effective AI for rehabilitation. Finally, we present ideas for future work to pave the way for AI implementation in real-world rehabilitation practices.

Abstract: While videolaryngoscopy has resulted in better overall success rates of tracheal intubation, airway assessment is still an important prerequisite for safe airway management. This study aimed to create an artificial intelligence model to identify difficult videolaryngoscopy using a neural network. Baseline characteristics, medical history, bedside examination and seven facial images were included as predictor variables. ResNet-18 was introduced to recognise images and extract features. Different machine learning algorithms were utilised to develop predictive models. A videolaryngoscopy view of Cormack-Lehane grade of 1 or 2 was classified as 'non-difficult', while grade 3 or 4 was classified as 'difficult'. A total of 5849 patients were included, of whom 5335 had non-difficult and 514 had difficult videolaryngoscopy. The facial model (only including facial images) using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm showed the highest area under the curve (95%CI) of 0.779 (0.733-0.825) with a sensitivity (95%CI) of 0.757 (0.650-0.845) and specificity (95%CI) of 0.721 (0.626-0.794) in the test set. Compared with bedside examination and multivariate scores (El-Ganzouri and Wilson), the facial model had significantly higher predictive performance (p < 0.001). Artificial intelligence-based facial analysis is a feasible technique for predicting difficulty during videolaryngoscopy, and the model developed using neural networks has higher predictive performance than traditional methods.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the strength of associations between different indices of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and brain health outcomes in children with overweight/obesity. METHODS: Participants were 100 children aged 8-11 years. CRF was assessed using treadmill exercise test (peak oxygen uptake [V̇O(2peak) ], treadmill time, and V̇O(2) at ventilatory threshold) and 20-metre shuttle run test (20mSRT, laps, running speed, estimated V̇O(2peak) using the equations by Leger et al., Mahar et al., and Matsuzaka et al.). Intelligence, executive functions, and academic performance were assessed using validated methods. Total gray matter and hippocampal volumes were assessed using structural MRI. RESULTS: V̇O(2peak) /body mass (beta = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.01-0.35) and treadmill time (beta = 0.18-0.21, 95% CI = 0.01-0.39) were positively associated with gray matter volume. 20mSRT laps were positively associated with executive functions (beta = 0.255, 95% CI = 0.089-0.421) and academic performance (beta = 0.199-0.255, 95% CI = 0.006-0.421), and the running speed was positively associated with executive functions (beta = 0.203, 95% CI = 0.039-0.367). Estimated V̇O(2peak/Leger et al.) was positively associated with intelligence, executive functions, academic performance, and gray matter volume (beta = 0.205-0.282, 95% CI = 0.013-0.500). Estimated V̇O(2peak/Mahar et al.) and V̇O(2peak/Matsuzaka et al. (speed)) were positively associated with executive functions (beta = 0.204-0.256, 95% CI = 0.031-0.436). CONCLUSION: Although V̇O(2peak) is considered the gold standard indicator of CRF in children, peak performance (laps or running speed) and estimated V̇O(2peak/Leger et al.) derived from 20mSRT had stronger and more consistent associations with brain health outcomes than other indices of CRF in children with overweight/obesity.

Abstract: Developing compounds with novel structures is important for the production of new drugs. From an intellectual perspective, confirming the patent status of newly developed compounds is essential, particularly for pharmaceutical companies. The generation of a large number of compounds has been made possible because of the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). However, confirming the patent status of these generated molecules has been a challenge because there are no free and easy-to-use tools that can be used to determine the novelty of the generated compounds in terms of patents in a timely manner; additionally, there are no appropriate reference databases for pharmaceutical patents in the world. In this study, two public databases, SureChEMBL and Google Patents Public Datasets, were used to create a reference database of drug-related patented compounds using international patent classification. An exact structure search system was constructed using InChIKey and a relational database system to rapidly search for compounds in the reference database. Because drug-related patented compounds are a good source for generative AI to learn useful chemical structures, they were used as the training data. Furthermore, molecule generation was successfully directed by increasing and decreasing the number of generated patented compounds through incorporation of patent status (i.e., patented or not) into learning. The use of patent status enabled generation of novel molecules with high drug-likeness. The generation using generative AI with patent information would help efficiently propose novel compounds in terms of pharmaceutical patents. Scientific contribution: In this study, a new molecule-generation method that takes into account the patent status of molecules, which has rarely been considered but is an important feature in drug discovery, was developed. The method enables the generation of novel molecules based on pharmaceutical patents with high drug-likeness and will help in the efficient development of effective drug compounds.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complete reporting is essential for clinical research. However, the endorsement of reporting guidelines in radiological journals is still unclear. Further, as a field extensively utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), the adoption of both general and AI reporting guidelines would be necessary for enhancing quality and transparency of radiological research. This study aims to investigate the endorsement of general reporting guidelines and those for AI applications in medical imaging in radiological journals, and explore associated journal characteristic variables. METHODS: This meta-research study screened journals from the Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging category, Science Citation Index Expanded of the 2022 Journal Citation Reports, and excluded journals not publishing original research, in non-English languages, and instructions for authors unavailable. The endorsement of fifteen general reporting guidelines and ten AI reporting guidelines was rated using a five-level tool: "active strong", "active weak", "passive moderate", "passive weak", and "none". The association between endorsement and journal characteristic variables was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We included 117 journals. The top-five endorsed reporting guidelines were CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, 58.1%, 68/117), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, 54.7%, 64/117), STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, 51.3%, 60/117), STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy, 50.4%, 59/117), and ARRIVE (Animal Research Reporting of In Vivo Experiments, 35.9%, 42/117). The most implemented AI reporting guideline was CLAIM (Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging, 1.7%, 2/117), while other nine AI reporting guidelines were not mentioned. The Journal Impact Factor quartile and publisher were associated with endorsement of reporting guidelines in radiological journals. CONCLUSIONS: The general reporting guideline endorsement was suboptimal in radiological journals. The implementation of reporting guidelines for AI applications in medical imaging was extremely low. Their adoption should be strengthened to facilitate quality and transparency of radiological study reporting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The unresolved debate about the management of corrosive ingestion is a major problem both for the patients and healthcare systems. This study aims to demonstrate the presence and the severity of the esophageal burn after caustic substance ingestion can be predicted with complete blood count parameters. METHODS: A multicenter, national, retrospective cohort study was performed on all caustic substance cases between 2000 and 2018. The classification learner toolbox of MATLAB version R2021a was used for the classification problem. Machine learning algorithms were used to forecast caustic burn. RESULTS: Among 1839 patients, 142 patients (7.7%) had burns. The type of the caustic and the PDW (platelet distribution width) values were the most important predictors. In the acid group, the AUC (area under curve) value was 84% while it was 70% in the alkaline group. The external validation had 85.17% accuracy in the acidic group and 91.66% in the alkaline group. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence systems have a high potential to be used in the prediction of caustic burns in pediatric age groups.

Journal Title: Pediatric research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular support (CVS) treatment failure (TF) is associated with a poor prognosis in preterm infants. METHODS: Medical charts of infants with a birth weight <1500 g who received either dopamine (Dp) or dobutamine (Db), were reviewed. Treatment response (TR) occurred if blood pressure increased >3rd centile for gestational age or superior vena cava flow was maintained >55 ml/kg/min, with decreased lactate or less negative base excess, without additional CVS. A predictive model of Dp and Db on TR was designed and the impact of TR on survival was analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-six infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks, median birth weight 864 g) received Dp (n = 44) or Db (n = 22). TR occurred in 59% of the cases treated with Dp and 31% with Db, p = 0.04. Machine learning identified a model that correctly labeled Db response in 90% of the cases and Dp response in 61.4%. Sixteen infants died (9% of the TR group, 39% of the TF group; p = 0.004). Brain or gut morbidity-free survival was observed in 52% vs 30% in the TR and TF groups, respectively (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: New predictive models can anticipate Db but not Dp effectiveness in preterm infants. These algorithms may help the clinicians in the decision-making process. IMPACT: Failure of cardiovascular support treatment increases the risk of mortality in very low birth weight infants. A predictive model built with machine learning techniques can help anticipate treatment response to dobutamine with high accuracy. Predictive models based on artificial intelligence may guide the clinicians in the decision-making process.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a serious public health issue that affects and is responsible for numerous fatalities and impairments. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the most prevalent and deadliest types of CVDs and is responsible for 45% of all CVD-related fatalities. IHD occurs when the blood supply to the heart is reduced due to narrowed or blocked arteries, which causes angina pectoris (AP) chest pain. AP is a common symptom of IHD and can indicate a higher risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat AP promptly and effectively. To forecast AP in women, we constructed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) method employing the tree-based algorithm known as an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). EBM is a machine learning (ML) technique that combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility and accuracy of gradient boosting. We applied EBM to a dataset of 200 female patients, 100 with AP and 100 without AP, and extracted the most relevant features for AP prediction. We then evaluated the performance of EBM against other AI methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). We found that EBM was the most accurate and well-balanced technique for forecasting AP, with accuracy (0.925) and Youden's index (0.960). We also looked at the global and local explanations provided by EBM to better understand how each feature affected the prediction and how each patient was classified. Our research showed that EBM is a useful AI method for predicting AP in women and identifying the risk factors related to it. This can help clinicians to provide personalized and evidence-based care for female patients with AP.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: Urban activities, particularly vehicle traffic, are contributing significantly to environmental pollution with detrimental effects on public health. The ability to anticipate air quality in advance is critical for public authorities and the general public to plan and manage these activities, which ultimately help in minimizing the adverse impact on the environment and public health effectively. Thanks to recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and sensor technology, forecasting air quality is possible through the consideration of various environmental factors. This paper presents our novel solution for air quality prediction and its correlation with different environmental factors and urban activities, such as traffic density. To this aim, we propose a multi-modal framework by integrating real-time data from different environmental sensors and traffic density extracted from Closed Circuit Television footage. The framework effectively addresses data inconsistencies arising from sensor and camera malfunctions within a streaming dataset. The dataset exhibits real-world complexities, including abrupt camera or station activations/deactivations, noise interference, and outliers. The proposed system tackles the challenge of predicting air quality at locations having no sensors or experiencing sensor failures by training a joint model on the data obtained from nearby stations/sensors using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based merit fusion of the sensor data. The proposed methodology is evaluated using various variants of the LSTM model including Bi-directional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Convolutions LSTM (ConvLSTM) obtaining an improvement of 48%, 67%, and 173% for short-term, medium-term, and long-term periods, respectively, over the ARIMA model.

Journal Title: Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effect of acupuncture at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen (benefiting the intelligence and regulating the spirit) on the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the whole brain in the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and reveal the brain function mechanism of acupuncture in treatment of AD using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). METHODS: Sixty patients with mild to moderate AD were randomly divided into an acupuncture + medication group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped out) and a western medication group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped out). In the western medication group, the donepezil hydrochloride tablets were administered orally, 2.5 mg to 5 mg each time, once daily; and adjusted to be 10 mg each time after 4 weeks of medication. Besides the therapy as the western medication group, in the acupuncture + medication group, acupuncture was supplemented at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen, i.e. Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), and bilateral Shenmen (HT 7), Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Xuanzhong (GB 39). The needles were retained for 30 min in one treatment, once daily; and 6 treatments were required weekly. The duration of treatment was 6 weeks in each group. The general cognitive function was assessed by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive part (ADAS-Cog) before and after treatment in the two groups. Using the rs-fMRI, the changes in the functional connectivity (FC) of the left hippocampus and the whole brain before and after treatment were analyzed in the patients of the two groups (11 cases in the acupuncture + medication group and 12 cases in the western medication group). RESULTS: After treatment, compared with those before treatment, MMSE scores increased and ADAS-Cog scores decreased in the two groups (P<0.05); MMSE score was higher, while the ADAS-Cog score was lower in the acupuncture + medication group when compared with those in the western medication group (P</=0.05). After treatment, in the western medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was enhanced with the left fusiform gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus of the left triangular region, the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and the right superior parietal gyrus (P<0.05), while FC was weakened with the left inferior temporal gyrus, the left middle frontal gyrus and the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus when compared with that before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, in the acupuncture + medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was increased with the right gyrus rectus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the right superior temporal gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (P<0.05), and it was declined with the left thalamus (P<0.05) when compared with those before treatment. After treatment, in the acupuncture + medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was strengthened with the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, the right gyrus rectus, the bilateral superior occipital gyrus, the left lenticular nucleus putamen, the left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus of the left insulae operculum, the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the right posterior central gyrus (P<0.05) compared with that of the western medication group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen improves the cognitive function of AD patients, and its main brain functional mechanism is related to intensifying the functional connectivity of the left hippocampus with the default network (inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus), as well as with the sensory (posterior central gyrus) and visual (calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex and superior occipital gyrus) brain regions.

Abstract: The last five decades have witnessed significant improvement in diagnostics, treatment and management of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These advancements have become possible through progress in our understanding of the genetic and biological background of ALL, resulting in the introduction of risk-adapted treatment and novel therapeutic targets, e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors for BCR::ABL1-positive ALL. Further advances in the taxonomy of ALL and the discovery of new genetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, as well as the introduction of targeted and immunotherapies into the frontline treatment protocols, may improve management and outcome of children with ALL. In this review we describe the current developments in the (cyto)genetic diagnostics and management of children with ALL, and provide an overview of the most important advances in the genetic classification of ALL. Furthermore, we discuss perspectives resulting from the development of new techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability, agreement with provider measurement, and patient preferences regarding patient self-measurement of postvoid residual bladder volume (PVR). PVR measurement in the nonhealthcare setting is a valuable opportunity for remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients. We hypothesized that patient self-measurement of PVR using a smart-device portable ultrasound system with artificial intelligence would demonstrate high reliability, strong agreement with provider measurement, and be preferred over provider measurements. METHODS: Patients were enrolled during outpatient Urology visits. PVRs were measured in triplicate by providers using each of the following: an FDA-cleared (standard) bladder scanner, the portable ultrasound probe using ultrasound images (Butterfly US image mode), and the portable ultrasound probe using abstract images (Butterfly abstract mode). Subjects self-measured PVRs in triplicate using both imaging modes and reported their experiences via questionnaire. Reliability was assessed via intraclass correlation. Agreement between methods was assessed via Bland-Altman analyses using a clinically acceptable difference threshold of 50 mL. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 for each method. 95% limits of agreement between standard bladder scanner and patient self-measurement were - 71.73 mL and 86.73 mL using Butterfly US image mode and - 93.84 mL and 112.52 mL using Butterfly abstract mode, respectively. Most patients preferred self-measurement over provider measurement (74% vs 26%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patient self-measurement of PVR using smart-device integrated portable ultrasound probes is feasible, reliable, and preferred by patients. Limits of agreement between patient self-measurement and standard bladder scanner measurements exceeded our clinically acceptable difference threshold, though the inherent error of ultrasound-based bladder volume measurements should be considered. Longitudinal PVR assessments in nonhealthcare settings may facilitate remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The burden of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is greater than that of heart failure; however, a cost-effective tool for asymptomatic LVD screening has not been well validated. We aimed to prospectively validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm for asymptomatic LVD detection and evaluate its cost-effectiveness for opportunistic screening. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, patients undergoing ECG at outpatient clinics or health check-ups were enrolled in two hospitals in Taiwan. Patients were stratified into LVD (LVEF <= 40%) risk groups using a previously developed ECG algorithm. The performance of AI-ECG was used to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of LVD screening compared with no screening. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and sensitivity analyses were employed to examine the cost-effectiveness and robustness of the results. RESULTS: Among the 29,137 patients, the algorithm demonstrated area-under-the-curves of 0.984 and 0.945 for detecting LVD within 28 days in the two hospital cohorts. For patients not initially scheduled for an echocardiogram, the algorithm predicted future echocardiograms (high-risk, 46.2%; medium-risk, 31.4%; low-risk, 14.6%) and LVD at 12 months (high-risk, 26.2%; medium-risk, 3.4%; low-risk, 0.1%). Opportunistic screening with AI-ECG could result in a negative ICER of -$7,439 for patients aged 65, with consistent cost-savings across age groups and particularly in men. Approximately 91.5% of the cases were found to be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay of $30,000 in the probabilistic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AI-ECG for asymptomatic LVD risk stratification is promising, and opportunistic screening in outpatient clinics has the potential to save costs.
