Journal Title: Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of an artificial intelligence (AI) model, ChatGPT, in predicting the diabetic retinopathy (DR) risk. METHODS: This retrospective observational study utilized an anonymized dataset of 111 patients with diabetes who underwent a comprehensive eye examination along with clinical and biochemical assessments. Clinical and biochemical data along with and without central subfield thickness (CST) values of the macula from OCT were uploaded to ChatGPT-4, and the response from the ChatGPT was compared to the clinical DR diagnosis made by an ophthalmologist. RESULTS: The study assessed the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT, yielding an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) value of 0.936 (95% CI, 0.913-0.954, p < 0.001) (with CST) and 0.915 (95% CI, 0.706-0.846, p < 0.001) (without CST), both situations indicated excellent reliability. The sensitivity and specificity of ChatGPT in predicting the DR cases were evaluated. The results revealed a sensitivity of 67% with CST and 73% without CST. The specificity was 68% with CST and 54% without CST. However, Cohen's kappa revealed only a fair agreement between ChatGPT predictions and clinical DR status in both situations, with CST (kappa = 0.263, p = 0.005) and without CST (kappa = 0.351, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that ChatGPT has the potential of a preliminary DR screening tool with further optimization needed for clinical use.

Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Due to the inefficiency and high cost of the current healthcare supply chain mode, in order to adapt to the great changes in the global economy and public health, it is urgent to choose an effective mode for sustainable development of healthcare supply chain. The aim of this paper is to use artificial intelligence systems to make intelligent decisions for healthcare supply chain mode selection. METHODS: Firstly, according to the economic benefits, social benefits and environmental benefits of healthcare supply chain, this paper identifies different healthcare supply chain modes in combination with artificial intelligence technology. Secondly, this paper presents the intelligent choice optimization method of healthcare supply chain mode based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, the effect of artificial intelligence in healthcare supply chain mode selection is verified by simulation experiment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The experimental results show that healthcare supply chain mode selected by artificial intelligence is basically consistent with the target mode, while healthcare supply chain mode selected by the basic selection method, BP neural network method and big data method is different from the target mode, which indicates that AI has more advantages in the selection of medical supply chain mode. Therefore, we recommend the application of artificial intelligence to healthcare supply chain management. This study not only makes up for the ineffective problems of existing methods, but also makes up for the gaps in the application of AI technology in the field of healthcare supply chain. The scientific value of this paper is that the proposed framework and the artificial intelligence algorithm enrich the relevant theories of healthcare supply chain research and provide methodological guidance for intelligent decision-making of healthcare supply chain. At the same time, for medical enterprises, this research provides a new practical guideline for the application of artificial intelligence in the sustainable development and modern management of healthcare supply chain.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brainomix e-Stroke is an artificial intelligence-based decision support tool that aids the interpretation of CT imaging in the context of acute stroke. While e-Stroke has the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, real-world validation is essential. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the performance of Brainomix e-Stroke in an unselected cohort of patients with suspected acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: The study cohort included all patients admitted to the University College London Hospital Hyperacute Stroke Unit between October 2021 and April 2022. For e-ASPECTS and e-CTA, the ground truth was determined by a neuroradiologist with access to all clinical and imaging data. For e-CTP, the values of the core infarct and ischaemic penumbra were compared with those derived from syngo.via, an alternate software used at our institution. RESULTS: 1163 studies were performed in 551 patients admitted during the study period. Of these, 1130 (97.2%) were successfully processed by e-Stroke in an average of 4 min. For identifying acute middle cerebral artery territory ischaemia, e-ASPECTS had an accuracy of 77.0% and was more specific (83.5%) than sensitive (58.6%). The accuracy for identifying hyperdense thrombus was lower (69.1%), which was mainly due to many false positives (positive predictive value of 22.9%). Identification of acute haemorrhage was highly accurate (97.8%) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.6%; false positives were typically caused by areas of calcification. The accuracy of e-CTA for large vessel occlusions was 91.5%. The core infarct and ischaemic penumbra volumes provided by e-CTP strongly correlated with those provided by syngo.via (rho=0.804-0.979). CONCLUSION: Brainomix e-Stroke software provides rapid and reliable analysis of CT imaging in the acute stroke setting although, in line with the manufacturer's guidance, it should be used as an adjunct to expert interpretation rather than a standalone decision-making tool.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GM pathology plays an essential role in MS disability progression, emphasizing the importance of neuroradiologic biomarkers to capture the heterogeneity of cortical disease burden. This study aimed to assess the validity of a patch-wise, individual interpretation of cortical thickness data to identify GM pathology, the "mosaic approach," which was previously suggested as a biomarker for assessing and localizing atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mosaic approach in a cohort of 501 patients with MS with respect to 89 internal and 651 external controls. The resulting metric of the mosaic approach is the so-called thin patch fraction, which is an estimate of overall cortical disease burden per patient. We evaluated the mosaic approach with respect to the following: 1) discrimination between patients with MS and controls, 2) classification between different MS phenotypes, and 3) association with established biomarkers reflecting MS disease burden, using general linear modeling. RESULTS: The thin patch fraction varied significantly between patients with MS and healthy controls and discriminated among MS phenotypes. Furthermore, the thin patch fraction was associated with disease burden, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale, cognitive and fatigue scores, and lesion volume. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the validity of the mosaic approach as a neuroradiologic biomarker in MS. The output of the mosaic approach, namely the thin patch fraction, is a candidate biomarker for assessing and localizing cortical GM pathology. The mosaic approach can furthermore enhance the development of a personalized cortical MS biomarker, given that the thin patch fraction provides a feature on which artificial intelligence methods can be trained. Most important, we showed the validity of the mosaic approach when referencing data with respect to external control MR imaging repositories.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of P wave in identifying left atrial enlargement (LAE) using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) models is unclear. It is also unknown if AI-enabled single-lead ECGs could be used as a diagnostic tool for LAE surveillance. We aimed to build AI-enabled P-wave and single-lead ECG models to identify LAE using sinus rhythm (SR) and/or non-SR ECGs, and compared the prognostic ability of severe LAE as left atrial diameter (LAD) >/=50 mm assessed by AI-enabled ECG models and echocardiography. METHODS: This retrospective study used data from 382,594 consecutive adults with paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiograms measured within 2 weeks at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. UNet++ was used for P-wave segmentation. ResNet-18 was used to develop deep convolutional neural network-enabled ECG models for discriminating LAE. External validation was performed using data from 11,753 patients from another hospital. RESULTS: The AI-enabled 12-lead ECG model outperformed other ECG models for classifying LAE, but the single-lead ECG models also showed excellent performance at an LAD cut-off 50 mm. AI-enabled ECG models had excellent and fair discrimination on LAE using the SR and the non-SR dataset, respectively. Severe LAE identified by AI-enabled ECG models was more predictive of future cardiovascular disease than echocardiography; however, the cumulative incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation and heart failure was higher in patients with echocardiography-severe LAE than AI-enabled ECG-severe LAE. CONCLUSIONS: P wave plays a crucial role in discriminating LAE in AI-enabled ECG models. AI-enabled ECG models outperform echocardiography in predicting new-onset cardiovascular diseases associated with severe LAE.

Abstract: The attention level of students in a classroom can be improved through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. By automatically identifying the attention level, teachers can employ strategies to regain students' focus. This can be achieved through various sources of information. One source is to analyze the emotions reflected on students' faces. AI can detect emotions, such as neutral, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, happiness, and anger. Additionally, the direction of the students' gaze can also potentially indicate their level of attention. Another source is to observe the students' body posture. By using cameras and deep learning techniques, posture can be analyzed to determine the level of attention. For example, students who are slouching or resting their heads on their desks may have a lower level of attention. Smartwatches distributed to the students can provide biometric and other data, including heart rate and inertial measurements, which can also be used as indicators of attention. By combining these sources of information, an AI system can be trained to identify the level of attention in the classroom. However, integrating the different types of data poses a challenge that requires creating a labeled dataset. Expert input and existing studies are consulted for accurate labeling. In this paper, we propose the integration of such measurements and the creation of a dataset and a potential attention classifier. To provide feedback to the teacher, we explore various methods, such as smartwatches or direct computers. Once the teacher becomes aware of attention issues, they can adjust their teaching approach to re-engage and motivate the students. In summary, AI techniques can automatically identify the students' attention level by analyzing their emotions, gaze direction, body posture, and biometric data. This information can assist teachers in optimizing the teaching-learning process.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate cognitive functioning in patients with higher education having post COVID-19 condition. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=38; mean age, 48.5y; 71% women) at the Cognitive Post COVID-19 Clinic at Danderyd University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, who sought health care because of self-experienced cognitive problems. All had at least 4 years of university education and an initially mild infection (ie, most were not hospital admitted, none were admitted to intensive care). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive test performance assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including Information, Matrix Reasoning, Coding, and Digit Span from Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, Buschke Selective Reminding Test, Rey Complex Figure Test, Ruff 2&7, Color-Word Interference Test, Verbal Fluency, and Trail Making Test. The mean time between the infection and the assessment was 18 months. RESULTS: Cognitive deficits were evident on tests of verbal learning and memory (Buschke Selective Reminding Test) and selective attention (Ruff 2&7). Approximately 50% of the participants had scores lower than 1 SD below the mean in the norm group on the measures of verbal learning and memory. When estimated premorbid cognitive functioning was accounted for, deficits were suggested in most cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: Post COVID-19 condition seems to be associated with cognitive deficits, even in patients with high education and an initially mild infection.

Journal Title: Environmental epigenetics
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Three successive multiple generations of rats were exposed to different toxicants and then bred to the transgenerational F5 generation to assess the impacts of multiple generation different exposures. The current study examines the actions of the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on the F0 generation, followed by jet fuel hydrocarbon mixture exposure of the F1 generation, and then pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane on the F2 generation gestating females. The subsequent F3 and F4 generations and F5 transgenerational generation were obtained and F1-F5 generations examined for male sperm epigenetic alterations and pathology in males and females. Significant impacts on the male sperm differential DNA methylation regions were observed. The F3-F5 generations were similar in  approximately 50% of the DNA methylation regions. The pathology of each generation was assessed in the testis, ovary, kidney, and prostate, as well as the presence of obesity and tumors. The pathology used a newly developed Deep Learning, artificial intelligence-based histopathology analysis. Observations demonstrated compounded disease impacts in obesity and metabolic parameters, but other pathologies plateaued with smaller increases at the F5 transgenerational generation. Observations demonstrate that multiple generational exposures, which occur in human populations, appear to increase epigenetic impacts and disease susceptibility.

Title: Embedding a multiple health condition approach across NHS Greater Manchester.
Author: ['Lake C', 'Mishra A', 'Conroy M']
Journal Title: Future healthcare journal
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Here, we present two real-world examples of how a prioritised, person-centred, multiple health condition approach - also termed a multimorbidity approach - has been applied to long-term condition management in general practice in Greater Manchester. The first example is the implementation of targeted multiple health condition reviews via a population health management approach across general practice in the City of Manchester. The second example is the development of a person-centred risk stratification tool, focused on unmet cardiovascular need, called 'CVNeed'. This tool provides a unique approach to highlighting the highest unmet need and, thus, the largest return on investment to the system from proactive efforts. These examples demonstrate how a person-centred, multiple health condition approach to long-term condition management, enabled by data intelligence to drive prioritisation of clinical need, can help to address longstanding health inequalities and unwarranted variation in health outcomes. This work also highlights the potential for integrated care systems (ICS) to work collaboratively to tackle health inequalities at a system, locality and neighbourhood level, thus making significant strides toward achieving the vision set out in the Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) Strategy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) technology to explore for automated medical record quality control methods, standardize the process for medical record documentation, and deal with the drawbacks of manually implemented quality control. METHODS: In this study, we constructed a medical record quality control system based on AI. We first designed and built, for the system, a quality control rule base based on authoritative standards and expert opinions. Then, medical records data were automatically collected through a data acquisition engine and were converted into structured data through a post-structured engine. Finally, the medical record quality control engine was combined with the rule base to analyze the data, identify quality problems, and realize automated intelligent quality control. This system was applied to the quality control of medical records and five quality control points were selected, including similarities in the history of the present illness, defects in the description of chief complaints, incomplete initial diagnosis, missing in formation in the history of menstruation, marriage, and childbirth, and mismatch between the chief complaints and the history of the present illness. We randomly selected 2 918 medical records of patients discharged in January 2022 to conduct AI quality control. Then we organized medical record quality control experts to conduct an accuracy review, made a comparison with previous manual quality control records, and analyzed the results. The number of quality problems that were verified in the accuracy review was taken as the gold standard and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for the 5 quality control points. RESULTS: According to the accuracy review performed by medical record quality control experts, the accuracy of AI quality control reached 89.57%. For the sampled medical records, the results of AI quality control were compared with those of previous manually performed quality control and only one problem detected by manual quality control of the sampled medical records was not detected by the AI quality control system. The number of medical record quality problems correctly detected by AI quality control was about 2.97 times that of manual quality control. Analysis of the ROC curves showed that the AUC of the five quality control points of the AI quality control system were statistically significant (P<0.05) and all the AUC values approximated or exceeded 0.9. In contrast, results obtained through manually performed quality control found significant AUC (0.797) for only one quality control point-similarities in the history of present illness (P<0.05). Comparison of the AUC values of the two quality control methods showed that AI quality control system had an advantage over manually performed quality control for the five quality control points. CONCLUSION: Through the application of medical record quality control system based on AI, efficient full quality control of medical record documentation can be achieved and the detection rate of quality problems can be effectively improved. In addition, the system helps save manpower and improve the quality of medical record documentation.

Title: Gender Disparities in First Authorship in Publications Related to Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Author: ['Abraham J', 'Panchal K', 'Varshney L', 'Lakshmi Narayan K', 'Rahman S']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: The medical profession has experienced a significant increase in the number of women practitioners in recent decades, leading to a reduction in the gender gap. According to the United States Medical Association, approximately 25% of physicians in the United States are now women. Although this progress is evident in the clinical setting, women's representation in academic medicine remains disproportionately low. The underrepresentation of women in academia has various consequences, including limited access to academic resources and hindered career growth. Previous studies have attempted to analyze these disparities, but results have been inconsistent, and the issue's complexity has not been fully understood. This study aims to examine the disparity in the gender of first authors in academic publications related to " Artificial intelligence (AI) and Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD)" between 2010 and 2023. Analysis was conducted on June 21st, 2023, using the database PubMed. The search term "AI" AND "ADHD" was used to derive all articles over a period of 13 years, from January 1st, 2010, to December 31st, 2022, excluding the year 2023 due to limited available publications. The relevant articles were downloaded in Microsoft Excel sheets. The gender of the first authors was determined using the NamSor app V.2, an application programming interface (API) with a large dataset of names and countries of origin. A total of 204 articles were considered for this study. There were 78 female first authors and 126 male first authors. The highest number of publications with a male first author occurred in 2022, with 32 publications. The Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, and China have the highest gender ratios, indicating a more favourable representation of both genders. The p-value of 0.2664 suggests that there is no significant association between gender and country. The findings revealed a gender disparity, with a higher number of male first authors. By addressing and rectifying these disparities, we can enhance the overall quality, diversity, and inclusivity of research in the field of ADHD and Artificial Intelligence.

Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a gradually maturing medical imaging technique that relies on computational algorithms for reconstructing and visualizing internal conductivity distributions within the human body. To provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the current state and trends in the EIT algorithm research, we conducted bibliometric analysis on a 25-year EIT algorithm research dataset sourced from Web of Science Core Collections. We visualized publication characteristics, collaboration patterns, keywords, and co-cited references. The results indicate a steady increase in annual publications over recent decades. The United States, United Kingdom, China, and South Korea contributed 60% of the articles collaboratively. Keyword analysis unveiled three distinct stages in the evolution of EIT algorithm research: the establishment of fundamental algorithm frameworks, optimization for improved imaging performance, and the development of algorithms for clinical applications. Additionally, there has been a shift in research focus from traditional theories to the incorporation of new methods, such as artificial intelligence. Co-cited references suggest that integrating EIT with other established imaging techniques may emerge as a new trend in EIT algorithm research. In summary, EIT algorithms have been a consistent research focus, with current efforts centered on optimizing algorithms to enhance imaging performance. The emerging research trend involves utilizing more diverse and intersecting algorithms.

Abstract: AIM AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to analyze the various influencing factors affecting the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled virtual assistants (VAs) for self-management of leukemia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design is adopted in this study. The questionnaire included eight factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, trust, perceived privacy risk, and personal innovativeness) affecting the acceptance of AI-enabled virtual assistants. A total of 397 leukemia patients participated in the online survey. RESULTS: Performance expectancy (mu = 3.14), effort expectancy (mu = 3.05), and personal innovativeness (mu = 3.14) were identified to be the major influencing factors of AI adoption. Statistically significant differences (p < .05) were observed between the gender-based and age groups of the participants in relation to the various factors. In addition, perceived privacy risks were negatively correlated with all other factors. CONCLUSION: Although there are negative factors such as privacy risks and ethical issues in AI adoption, perceived effectiveness and ease of use among individuals are leading to greater adoption of AI-enabled VAs.
