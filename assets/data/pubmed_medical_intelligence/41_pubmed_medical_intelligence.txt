Title: Ten questions to AI regarding the present and future of proteomics.
Author: ['Stransky S', 'Sun Y', 'Shi X', 'Sidoli S']
Journal Title: Frontiers in molecular biosciences
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The role of a scientist is at first not so different from a philosopher. They both need to question common thinking and evaluate whether reality is not as we always thought. Based on this, we need to design hypotheses, experiments, and analyses to prove our alternative vision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an "assistant" into a proper "colleague" for literature mining, data analysis and interpretation, and literally having (almost) real scientific conversations. However, being AI based on existing information, if we rely on it excessively will we still be able to question the status quo? In this article, we are particularly interested in discussing the future of proteomics and mass spectrometry with our new electronic collaborator. We leave to the reader the judgement whether the answers we received are satisfactory or superficial. What we were mostly interested in was laying down what we think are critical questions that the proteomics community should occasionally ask to itself. Proteomics has been around for more than 30 years, but it is still missing a few critical steps to fully address its promises as being the new genomics for clinical diagnostics and fundamental science, while becoming a user-friendly tool for every lab. Will we get there with the help of AI? And will these answers change in a short period, as AI continues to advance?

Title: Laparoscopic Projection Mapping of the Liver Portal Segment, Based on Augmented Reality Combined With Artificial Intelligence, for Laparoscopic Anatomical Liver Resection.
Author: ['Kasai M', 'Uchiyama H', 'Aihara T', 'Ikuta S', 'Yamanaka N']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma causes intrahepatic metastasis via the trans-portal vein. Thus, appropriate mapping of portal segments is necessary for laparoscopic anatomical liver resection. However, because of the difficulty in identifying tactile sensations and the limited surgical view of laparoscopy, augmented reality (AR) has recently been utilized in laparoscopic liver surgery to identify the tumor, vessels, and portal segments. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) has been employed to identify landmarks in two-dimensional (2D) images because of concerns regarding the accuracy of superimposing a three-dimensional (3D) model onto a 2D laparoscopic image. In this study, we report an AR-based projection mapping method of portal segments superimposing preoperative 3D models assisted by AI in laparoscopic surgery. The liver silhouette in laparoscopic images should be detected to superimpose 3D models. Labeled liver silhouettes were obtained from 380 images in surgical videos as learning images to implement AI-based silhouette detection. To implement this technique, we used Detectron2, a PyTorch-based object detection library by Facebook AI Research (Now, Meta AI, Menlo Park, California, United States). In the videos, the liver edges were displayed as green outlines according to AI. Additionally, 3D liver models with segmental mapping were generated using the open-source software 3D Slicer from computed tomography images. For AR display, we utilized the model target function of Vuforia SDK (PTC, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States), an industrial AR library with silhouette-based AR display. Lastly, we merged the AI output video with a 3D model in Unity (Unity Software Inc., San Francisco, California, United States) to establish the projection mapping of the portal segment on 2D surgical images. The accuracy was assessed by measuring the maximum error between the liver edges of laparoscopic images and 3D liver silhouettes in five surgical videos. The maximum error between liver edges and 3D model silhouettes ranged from 4 mm to 22 mm in the AI-based approach and 12 mm to 55 mm in the non-AI-based approach. Meanwhile, the mean error was 14.5 and 31.2 mm in the AI-based and non-AI-based approaches, respectively. Despite camera movement, 3D AR displays were maintained. Thus, our AI-assisted projection mapping of the portal segment could offer a new approach for laparoscopic anatomical liver resection.

Author: ['El-Naggar MT', 'Elkitkat RS', 'Ziada HE', 'Esporcatte LPG', 'Ambrosio R Jr']
Journal Title: Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate preoperative risk factors (mainly those related to corneal topography/tomography) for post-LASIK ectasia development. METHODS: A retrospective case review for post-LASIK ectasia for myopia or myopic astigmatism. The evaluated data included preoperative subjective refraction, method of flap creation, and topometric/tomographic parameters from Oculus Pentacam, including subjective curvature pattern, topometric, elevation, and pachymetric indices from the Belin Ambrosio display "BAD", and the Pentacam Random Forest Index (PRFI). Moreover, preoperative ectasia detection indices were calculated (including Percentage of Tissue Altered "PTA" index, Randleman Ectasia Risk Score System "ERSS", and Navarro Index for Corneal Ectasia "NICE"). RESULTS: Twenty-four eyes of 15 patients were enrolled. Concerning the risk factors, age was lower than 25 in 19 eyes (79%); flaps were created using a microkeratome in 17 eyes (70.8%); thinnest pachymetry was lower than 510mum in eight eyes (33%); total deviation from BAD was higher than 1.6 in 50%; Ambrosio's relational thickness (ART) max was lower than 340 in 45.83%; PTA index was higher than 40% in 16%; ERSS was more than 3 points in 62.5%; NICE was higher than 8 points in three eyes (12.5%); PRFI index was more than 0.125 in 87.5%; two eyes (8%) had no identifiable risk factors. CONCLUSION: Current ectasia risk assessment criteria were insufficient for detecting a relatively large number of cases. There is an unequivocal need for more information, which may be derived from biomechanical assessment and epithelial thickness mapping. Novel corneal tomography indices derived from artificial intelligence may increase accuracy in characterizing ectasia susceptibility.

Journal Title: Frontiers in neurology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Neuroproteomics, an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and proteomics, has garnered significant attention in the context of neurotrauma research. Neuroproteomics involves the quantitative and qualitative analysis of nervous system components, essential for understanding the dynamic events involved in the vast areas of neuroscience, including, but not limited to, neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, mental illness, traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other neurodegenerative diseases. With advancements in mass spectrometry coupled with bioinformatics and systems biology, neuroproteomics has led to the development of innovative techniques such as microproteomics, single-cell proteomics, and imaging mass spectrometry, which have significantly impacted neuronal biomarker research. By analyzing the complex protein interactions and alterations that occur in the injured brain, neuroproteomics provides valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurotrauma. This review explores how such insights can be harnessed to advance personalized medicine (PM) approaches, tailoring treatments based on individual patient profiles. Additionally, we highlight the potential future prospects of neuroproteomics, such as identifying novel biomarkers and developing targeted therapies by employing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). By shedding light on neurotrauma's current state and future directions, this review aims to stimulate further research and collaboration in this promising and transformative field.

Journal Title: Physiotherapy theory and practice
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are gaining popularity in healthcare. OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a language model that comprehends and generates human language, providing instant data analysis and recommendations. This is particularly significant in the dynamic field of physiotherapy, where its integration has the potential to enhance healthcare efficiency. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate whether ChatGPT-3.5 (free version) provides consistent and accurate clinical responses, its ability to imitate human clinical reasoning in simple and complex scenarios, and its capability to produce a differential diagnosis. METHODS: Two studies were conducted using the ChatGPT-3.5. Study 1 evaluated the consistency and accuracy of ChatGPT's responses in clinical assessment using ten user-participants who submitted the phrase "Which are the main steps for a completed physiotherapy assessment?" Study 2 assessed ChatGPT's differential diagnostic ability using published case studies by 2 independent participants. The case reports consisted of one simple and one complex scenario. RESULTS: Study 1 underscored the variability in ChatGPT's responses, which ranged from comprehensive to concise. Notably, essential steps such as re-assessment and subjective examination were omitted in 30% and 40% of the responses, respectively. In Study 2, ChatGPT demonstrated its capability to develop evidence-based clinical reasoning, particularly evident in simple clinical scenarios. Question phrasing significantly impacted the generated answers. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential benefits of using ChatGPT in healthcare. It also provides a balanced perspective on ChatGPT's strengths and limitations and emphasizes the importance of using AI tools in a responsible and informed manner.

Title: Fusion Modeling: Combining Clinical and Imaging Data to Advance Cardiac Care.
Author: ['van Assen M', 'Tariq A', 'Razavi AC', 'Yang C', 'Banerjee I', 'De Cecco CN']
Journal Title: Circulation. Cardiovascular imaging
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: In addition to the traditional clinical risk factors, an increasing amount of imaging biomarkers have shown value for cardiovascular risk prediction. Clinical and imaging data are captured from a variety of data sources during multiple patient encounters and are often analyzed independently. Initial studies showed that fusion of both clinical and imaging features results in superior prognostic performance compared with traditional scores. There are different approaches to fusion modeling, combining multiple data resources to optimize predictions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. However, manual extraction of clinical and imaging data is time and labor intensive and often not feasible in clinical practice. An automated approach for clinical and imaging data extraction is highly desirable. Convolutional neural networks and natural language processing can be utilized for the extraction of electronic medical record data, imaging studies, and free-text data. This review outlines the current status of cardiovascular risk prediction and fusion modeling; and in addition gives an overview of different artificial intelligence approaches to automatically extract data from images and electronic medical records for this purpose.

Practitioners can now utilize AI tools to advance diagnostic protocols and improve patient care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to present the importance and modalities of AI in maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics and its usefulness in daily clinical work and decision-making process. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed by searching PubMed for articles published from inception up until August 2023, including the search terms "artificial intelligence in obstetrics", "maternal-fetal medicine", and "machine learning" combined through Boolean operators. In addition, references lists of identified articles were further reviewed for inclusion. RESULTS: According to recent research, AI has demonstrated remarkable potential in improving the accuracy and timeliness of diagnoses in maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics, e.g., advancing perinatal ultrasound technique, monitoring fetal heart rate during labor, or predicting mode of delivery. The combination of AI and obstetric ultrasound can help optimize fetal ultrasound assessment by reducing examination time and improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing physician workload. CONCLUSION: The integration of AI in maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes, enhance healthcare efficiency, and individualized care plans. As technology evolves, AI algorithms are likely to become even more sophisticated. However, the successful implementation of AI in maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics needs to address challenges related to interpretability and reliability.

Journal Title: Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spatial abilities are fundamental cognitive abilities, have direct applications in daily life, serve as a cognitive foundation for many other complex skills and are used in many specialty jobs. The current study aimed to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the spatial abilities of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) relative to mental ability-matched typically developing (TD) children based on Newcombe and Shipley's double-dimension theoretical framework for classifying spatial abilities. METHODS: Forty adolescents and young adults with DS and 40 TD children completed a nonverbal intelligence test (Raven's), two measures of static-extrinsic skills (water-level task and cart task), two measures of static-intrinsic skills (figure ground and form completion), two measures of dynamic-extrinsic skills (three mountains task and dog task) and two measures of dynamic-intrinsic spatial skills (mental rotation task and block design task). RESULTS: Participants with DS showed reduced performance on two dynamic-intrinsic tasks and one static-extrinsic task (i.e. cart task) relative to TD children. Performances were similar in two dynamic-extrinsic tasks and two static-intrinsic tasks. Analyses of composite accuracy for each spatial category further confirmed deficits in dynamic-intrinsic and static-extrinsic categories for people with DS relative to TD children. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed an uneven profile of spatial abilities in people with DS relative to ability-matched TD children with particular weaknesses in comprehending and manipulating dynamic-intrinsic and static-extrinsic spatial relations. Furthermore, our research has important clinical implications for more targeted interventions to improve spatial abilities in people with DS.

Title: An artificial neural network for full-body posture prediction in dynamic lifting activities and effects of its prediction errors on model-estimated spinal loads.
Author: ['Hosseini N', 'Arjmand N']
Journal Title: Journal of biomechanics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: Musculoskeletal models have indispensable applications in occupational risk assessment/management and clinical treatment/rehabilitation programs. To estimate muscle forces and joint loads, these models require body posture during the activity under consideration. Posture is usually measured via video-camera motion tracking approaches that are time-consuming, costly, and/or limited to laboratories. Alternatively, posture-prediction tools based on artificial intelligence can be trained using measured postures of several subjects performing many activities. We aimed to use our previous posture-prediction artificial neural network (ANN), developed based on many measured static postures, to predict posture during dynamic lifting activities. Moreover, effects of the ANN posture-prediction errors on dynamic spinal loads were investigated using subject-specific musculoskeletal models. Seven individuals each performed twenty-five lifting tasks while their full-body three-dimensional posture was measured by a 10-camera Vicon system and also predicted by the ANN as functions of the hand-load positions during the lifting activities. The measured and predicted postures (i.e., coordinates of 39 skin markers) and their model-estimated L5-S1 loads were compared. The overall root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and normalized (by the range of measured values) RMSE (nRMSE) between the predicted and measured postures for all markers/tasks/subjects was equal to 7.4 cm and 4.1 %, respectively (R(2) = 0.98 and p < 0.05). The model-estimated L5-S1 loads based on the predicted and measured postures were generally in close agreements as also confirmed by the Bland-Altman analyses; the nRMSE for all subjects/tasks was < 10 % (R(2) > 0.7 and p > 0.05). In conclusion, the easy-to-use ANN can accurately predict posture in dynamic lifting activities and its predicted posture can drive musculoskeletal models.

Title: Control of movement of underwater swimmers: Animals, simulated animates and swimming robots.
Author: ['Gordleeva SY', 'Kastalskiy IA', 'Tsybina YA', 'Ermolaeva AV', 'Hramov AE', 'Kazantsev VB']
Journal Title: Physics of life reviews
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: The control of movement in living organisms represents a fundamental task that the brain has evolved to solve. One crucial aspect is how the nervous system organizes the transformation of sensory information into motor commands. These commands lead to muscle activation and subsequent animal movement, which can exhibit complex patterns. One example of such movement is locomotion, which involves the translation of the entire body through space. Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neuronal circuits that provide control signals for these movements. Compared to the intricate circuits found in the brain, CPGs can be simplified into networks of neurons that generate rhythmic activation, coordinating muscle movements. Since the 1990s, researchers have developed numerous models of locomotive circuits to simulate different types of animal movement, including walking, flying, and swimming. Initially, the primary goal of these studies was to construct biomimetic robots. However, it became apparent that simplified CPGs alone were not sufficient to replicate the diverse range of adaptive locomotive movements observed in living organisms. Factors such as sensory modulation, higher-level control, and cognitive components related to learning and memory needed to be considered. This necessitated the use of more complex, high-dimensional circuits, as well as novel materials and hardware, in both modeling and robotics. With advancements in high-power computing, artificial intelligence, big data processing, smart materials, and electronics, the possibility of designing a new generation of true bio-mimetic robots has emerged. These robots have the capability to imitate not only simple locomotion but also exhibit adaptive motor behavior and decision-making. This motivation serves as the foundation for the current review, which aims to analyze existing concepts and models of movement control systems. As an illustrative example, we focus on underwater movement and explore the fundamental biological concepts, as well as the mathematical and physical models that underlie locomotion and its various modulations.

Author: ['Doo FX', 'Kulkarni P', 'Siegel E', 'Toland M', 'Yi PH', 'Carlos RC', 'Parekh VS']
Journal Title: Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Radiology now stands at the cusp of a growing technological revolution driven by artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models (LLMs), which demand robust computing capabilities and vast storage space - requirements often beyond the capacity of current non-cloud informatics systems. Cloud presents a potential solution, and we should weigh both their economic and environmental implications for radiology. These have recently become a cost-effective strategy, providing necessary infrastructure while reducing expenditures associated with hardware ownership, maintenance, and upgrades. Simultaneously, given the optimized energy consumption in modern cloud data centers, this transition is expected to reduce the environmental footprint of radiological operations. The path to cloud integration comes with its own challenges, and radiology informatics leaders must consider elements such as cloud architectural choices, pricing, data security, uptime service agreements, user training/support, and broader interoperability. With the increasing importance of data-driven tools in radiology , understanding and navigating the cloud landscape will be essential for the future of radiology and its various stakeholders.

Author: ['Hsu MF', 'Sriramoju MK', 'Lai CH', 'Chen YR', 'Huang JS', 'Ko TP', 'Huang KF', 'Hsu SD']
Journal Title: The Journal of biological chemistry
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: Proteins can spontaneously tie a variety of intricate topological knots through twisting and threading of the polypeptide chains. Recently developed artificial intelligence algorithms have predicted several new classes of topological knotted proteins, but the predictions remain to be authenticated experimentally. Here, we showed by X-ray crystallography and solution-state NMR spectroscopy that Q9PR55, an 89-residue protein from Ureaplasma urealyticum, possesses a novel 7(1) knotted topology that is accurately predicted by AlphaFold 2, except for the flexible N terminus. Q9PR55 is monomeric in solution, making it the smallest and most complex knotted protein known to date. In addition to its exceptional chemical stability against urea-induced unfolding, Q9PR55 is remarkably robust to resist the mechanical unfolding-coupled proteolysis by a bacterial proteasome, ClpXP. Our results suggest that the mechanical resistance against pulling-induced unfolding is determined by the complexity of the knotted topology rather than the size of the molecule.

Author: ['Yao X', 'Kumar MV', 'Su E', 'Flores Miranda A', 'Saha A', 'Sussman J']
Journal Title: Cancer epidemiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: To evaluate the performance accuracy and workload savings of artificial intelligence (AI)-based automation tools in comparison with human reviewers in medical literature screening for systematic reviews (SR) of primary studies in cancer research in order to gain insights on improving the efficiency of producing SRs. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and PROSPERO databases were searched from inception to November 30, 2022. Then, forward and backward literature searches were completed, and the experts in this field including the authors of the articles included were contacted for a thorough grey literature search. This SR was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42023384772). Among the 3947 studies obtained from search, five studies met the preplanned study selection criteria. These five studies evaluated four AI tools: Abstrackr (four studies), RobotAnalyst (one), EPPI-Reviewer (one), and DistillerSR (one). Without missing final included citations, Abstrackr eliminated 20%-88% of titles and abstracts (time saving of 7-86 hours) and 59% of the full-texts (62 h) from human review across four different cancer-related SRs. In comparison, RobotAnalyst (1% of titles and abstracts, 1 h), EPPI Review (38% of titles and abstracts, 58 h; 59% of full-texts, 62 h), DistillerSR (42% of titles and abstracts, 22 h) also provided similar or lower work savings for single cancer-related SRs. AI-based automation tools exhibited promising but varying levels of accuracy and efficiency during the screening process of medical literature for conducting SRs in the cancer field. Until further progress is made and thorough evaluations are conducted, AI tools should be utilized as supplementary aids rather than complete substitutes for human reviewers.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov 27
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: After lowering the Dutch threshold for active treatment from 25 to 24 completed weeks' gestation, survival to discharge increased by 10% in extremely preterm live born infants. Now that this guideline has been implemented, an accurate description of neurodevelopmental outcome at school age is needed. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: All neonatal intensive care units in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: All infants born between 24(0/7) and 26(6/7) weeks' gestation who were 5.5 years' corrected age (CA) in 2018-2020 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measure was neurodevelopmental outcome at 5.5 years. Neurodevelopmental outcome was a composite outcome defined as none, mild or moderate-to-severe impairment (further defined as neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI)), using corrected cognitive score (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Scale-III-NL), neurological examination and neurosensory function. Additionally, motor score (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2-NL) was assessed. All assessments were done as part of the nationwide, standardised follow-up programme. RESULTS: In the 3-year period, a total of 632 infants survived to 5.5 years' CA. Data were available for 484 infants (77%). At 5.5 years' CA, most cognitive and motor (sub)scales were significantly lower compared with the normative mean. Overall, 46% had no impairment, 36% had mild impairment and 18% had NDI. NDI-free survival was 30%, 49% and 67% in live born children at 24, 25 and 26 weeks' gestation, respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After lowering the threshold for supporting active treatment from 25 to 24 completed weeks' gestation, a considerable proportion of the surviving extremely preterm children did not have any impairment at 5.5 years' CA.

Abstract: Baseline [(18)F]FDG PET/CT radiomic features can improve the survival prediction in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether characterizing tumor locations relative to the spleen location in baseline [(18)F]FDG PET/CT images predicts survival in patients with DLBCL and improves the predictive value of total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and age-adjusted international prognostic index (IPI). Methods: This retrospective study included 301 DLBCL patients from the REMARC (NCT01122472) cohort. Physicians delineated the tumor regions, whereas the spleen was automatically segmented using an open-access artificial intelligence algorithm. We systematically measured the distance between the centroid of the spleen and all other lesions, defining the SD of these distances as the lesion spread (SpreadSpleen). We calculated the maximum distance between the spleen and another lesion (Dspleen) for each patient and normalized it with the body surface area, resulting in standardized Dspleen (sDspleen). The predictive value of each PET/CT feature for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated through univariate and multivariate time-dependent Cox models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: In total, 282 patients (mean age, 68.33 +/- 5.41 y; 164 men) were evaluated. The artificial intelligence algorithm successfully segmented the spleen in 96% of the patients. SpreadSpleen, Dspleen, and sDspleen were correlated neither with TMTV (Pearson rho < 0.23) nor with IPI (Pearson rho < 0.15). When median values were used as the cutoff, SpreadSpleen, Dspleen, and sDspleen all significantly classified patients into 2 risk groups for PFS and OS (P < 0.001). They complemented TMTV and IPI to classify the patients into 3 risk groups for PFS and OS (P < 0.001). Integrating SpreadSpleen, Dspleen, or sDspleen into a Cox model on the basis of TMTV, IPI, and TMTV combined with IPI significantly improved the concordance index for PFS and OS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Baseline PET/CT features that characterize tumor spread and dissemination relative to the spleen strongly predicted survival in patients with DLBCL. Integrating these features with TMTV and IPI further improved survival prediction.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor disease for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Timely detection and treatment has significant influence on patient outcomes. Over the last years, several artificial intelligence (AI) systems have emerged to assist the endoscopist. The primary focus of research has been computer aided detection (CADe). Several groups have succeeded in developing competitive models for neoplasia detection. Additionally, computer aided diagnosis (CADx) models have been developed for subsequent lesion characterization and assistance in clinical decision making. Future studies should focus on bridging the domain gap between academic development and integration in daily practice.
