Abstract: Infectious keratitis (IK) is a major cause of corneal opacity. IK can be caused by a variety of microorganisms. Typically, fungal ulcers carry the worst prognosis. Fungal cases can be subdivided into filamentous and yeasts, which shows fundamental differences. Delays in diagnosis or initiation of treatment increase the risk of ocular complications. Currently, the diagnosis of IK is mainly based on slit-lamp examination and corneal scrapings. Notably, these diagnostic methods have their drawbacks, including experience-dependency, tissue damage, and time consumption. Artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to mimic and enhance human decision-making. An increasing number of studies have utilized AI in the diagnosis of IK. In this paper, we propose to use AI to diagnose IK (model 1), differentiate between bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis (model 2), and discriminate the filamentous type from the yeast type of fungal cases (model 3). Overall, 9329 slit-lamp photographs gathered from 977 patients were enrolled in the study. The models exhibited remarkable accuracy, with model 1 achieving 99.3%, model 2 at 84%, and model 3 reaching 77.5%. In conclusion, our study offers valuable support in the early identification of potential fungal and bacterial keratitis cases and helps enable timely management.

Author: ['Kraus M', 'Anteby R', 'Konen E', 'Eshed I', 'Klang E']
Journal Title: European radiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Scaphoid fractures are usually diagnosed using X-rays, a low-sensitivity modality. Artificial intelligence (AI) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been explored for diagnosing scaphoid fractures in X-rays. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the use of AI for detecting scaphoid fractures on X-rays and analyze its accuracy and usefulness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and PRISMA-Diagnostic Test Accuracy. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database for original articles published until July 2023. The risk of bias and applicability were evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate diagnostic random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, and the results were analyzed using the Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were all retrospective. The AI's diagnostic performance for detecting scaphoid fractures ranged from AUC 0.77 to 0.96. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 3373 images. The meta-analysis pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.80 and 0.89, respectively. The meta-analysis overall AUC was 0.88. The QUADAS-2 tool found high risk of bias and concerns about applicability in 9 out of 10 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The current results of AI's diagnostic performance for detecting scaphoid fractures in X-rays show promise. The results show high overall sensitivity and specificity and a high SROC result. Further research is needed to compare AI's diagnostic performance to human diagnostic performance in a clinical setting. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Scaphoid fractures are prone to be missed secondary to assessment with a low sensitivity modality and a high occult fracture rate. AI systems can be beneficial for clinicians and radiologists to facilitate early diagnosis, and avoid missed injuries. KEY POINTS: * Scaphoid fractures are common and some can be easily missed in X-rays. * Artificial intelligence (AI) systems demonstrate high diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures in X-rays. * AI systems can be beneficial in diagnosing both obvious and occult scaphoid fractures.

Abstract: Cancer is one of the major causes of death in the modern world, and the incidence varies considerably based on race, ethnicity, and region. Novel cancer treatments, such as surgery and immunotherapy, are ineffective and expensive. In this situation, ion channels responsible for cell migration have appeared to be the most promising targets for cancer treatment. This research presents findings on the organic compounds present in Albizia lebbeck ethanolic extracts (ALEE), as well as their impact on the anti-migratory, anti-proliferative and cytotoxic potentials on MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) based models, multilayer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were performed to predict in vitro cancer cell migration on both cell lines, based on our experimental data. The organic compounds composition of the ALEE was studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Cytotoxicity, anti-proliferations, and anti-migratory activity of the extract using Tryphan Blue, MTT, and Wound Heal assay, respectively. Among the various concentrations (2.5-200 mug/mL) of the ALEE that were used in our study, 2.5-10 mug/mL revealed anti-migratory potential with increased concentrations, and they did not show any effect on the proliferation of the cells (P < 0.05; n >/= 3). Furthermore, the three data-driven models, Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and Extreme learning machine (ELM), predict the potential migration ability of the extract on the treated cells based on our experimental data. Overall, the concentrations of the plant extract that do not affect the proliferation of the type cells used demonstrated promising effects in reducing cell migration. XGB outperformed the MLP and ELM models and increased their performance efficiency by up to 3% and 1% for MCF and 1% and 2% for MDA-MB231, respectively, in the testing phase.

Title: [Ecology: The blind spot in pathology research].
Author: ['Chicaud M', 'Montero-Macias R', 'Taconet S']
Journal Title: Annales de pathologie
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 13
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The 2015 Paris Agreement has been the first restrictive agreement in the fight against climate change. The newer generations of pathologists, who feel more anxiety due to environmental problems than their predecessors, are asked to publish research works while they are harder and harder to and in a context of demographical tensions. We wanted to measure the rise of ecology research in pathology since the Paris Agreement. MATERIAL & METHODS: Over a ten years study period (2013-2022), we have identified via PubMed the number of articles in which forty-three terms taken from the sustainable development vocabulary appeared in ten renowned international pathology journals, selected for their SJR index from ScimagoJr and their impact factor, plus the Annales de pathologie, and compared their means of incidence between the 2013-2015 (m(1)) and 2016-2022 (m(2)) periods. The same process has been applied for "artificial intelligence", "deep learning" and "digital pathology". RESULTS: A total of 1336 articles have been identified. Only "digital pathology" (fromm(1)=8,33 to m(2)=23,29; p=0,010) and "deep learning" (fromm(1)=0 to m(2)=10,14; p=0,034) saw their incidence rise significantly. A significant decrease has been observed with "biological" (fromm(1)=70,00 to m(2)=56,86; p=0,020). DISCUSSION-CONCLUSIONS: Pathology reacts to trends but research in ecology has remained in the blind spot since 2015. However there seems to be an awakening as editorials, articles and communications in congress have blossomed the last two years.

Author: ['Kaneko S', 'Hirano Y', 'Matsuzawa D', 'Oiji A', 'Tanaka K']
Journal Title: Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: We investigated the association between everyday memory and autistic traits in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=22) and healthy adults (n=20) by using the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT). A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to explore the relationships between the subjects' performance on the RBMT as the objective variable and the composite score of the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) as the explanatory variable. Multiple models were created with the AQ subscales ('Social skills,' 'Attention-shifting,' 'Attention to details,' 'Communication,' 'Imagination'), age, gender, the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale added as the moderator variables. The GLM revealed that the AQ subscale 'Social skills' significantly predicted the RBMT-total scores with age, gender, and psychological measures scores as the moderator variables (Model 4: B=0.752, 95%CI: 0.191 to 1.313, p<0.01). Also, The GLM revealed that the AQ subscale 'Communication', in addition to 'Social skills', significantly predicted the RBMT- 'Prospective memory' (Model 4: B=0.298, 95%CI: 0.19 to 0.578, p<0.05). These results indicate an influence of social skills on everyday memory functioning, highlighting the weakness of memory processing in everyday life situations among individuals with ASD.

Abstract: The study of corneal biomechanics has become relevant in recent years due to its possible applications in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of various diseases such as glaucoma, keratorefractive surgery and different corneal diseases. The clinical biomechanical investigation has become of great importance in the setting of refractive surgery to identify patients at higher risk of developing iatrogenic ectasia. This review focuses on two of the technologies available for clinical use, the Ocular Response Analyzer (Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Buffalo, NY, USA) and the Corvis ST (Oculus Optikgergate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Both are non-contact tonometers that provided a clinical evaluation of corneal biomechanics. The fundamentals and main parameters of each device are described, as well as their use in eye surgery and the corneal biomechanical behavior in eye diseases. Finally, we will discuss the more recent Brillouin microscopy biomechanical analysis, and the integration Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography and biomechanical data with artificial intelligence to increase accuracy to detect risk of ectasia.

Abstract: ChatGPT is a virtual assistant with artificial intelligence (AI) that uses natural language to communicate, i.e., it holds conversations as those that would take place with another human being. It can be applied at all educational levels, including medical education, where it can impact medical training, research, the writing of scientific articles, clinical care, and personalized medicine. It can modify interactions between physicians and patients and thus improve the standards of healthcare quality and safety, for example, by suggesting preventive measures in a patient that sometimes are not considered by the physician for multiple reasons. ChatGPT potential uses in medical education, as a tool to support the writing of scientific articles, as a medical care assistant for patients and doctors for a more personalized medical approach, are some of the applications discussed in this article. Ethical aspects, originality, inappropriate or incorrect content, incorrect citations, cybersecurity, hallucinations, and plagiarism are some examples of situations to be considered when using AI-based tools in medicine.

Author: ['Wenderott K', 'Krups J', 'Luetkens JA', 'Gambashidze N', 'Weigl M']
Journal Title: European journal of radiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to alleviate the negative consequences of rising case numbers for radiologists. Currently, systematic evaluations of the impact of AI solutions in real-world radiological practice are missing. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the clinical implementation of an AI-based computer-aided detection system (CAD) for prostate MRI reading on clinicians' workflow, workflow throughput times, workload, and stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD was newly implemented into radiology workflow and accompanied by a prospective pre-post study design. We assessed prostate MRI case readings using standardized work observations and questionnaires. The observation period was three months each in a single department. Workflow throughput times, PI-RADS score, CAD usage and radiologists' self-reported workload and stress were recorded. Linear mixed models were employed for effect identification. RESULTS: In data analyses, 91 observed case readings (pre: 50, post: 41) were included. Variation of routine workflow was observed following CAD implementation. A non-significant increase in overall workflow throughput time was associated with CAD implementation (mean 16.99 +/- 6.21 vs 18.77 +/- 9.69 min, p = .51), along with an increase in diagnostic reading time for high suspicion cases (mean 15.73 +/- 4.99 vs 23.07 +/- 8.75 min, p = .02). Changes in radiologists' self-reported workload or stress were not found. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an AI-based detection aid was associated with lower standardization and no effects over time on radiologists' workload or stress. Expectations of AI decreasing the workload of radiologists were not confirmed by our real-world study. PRE-REGISTRATION: German register for clinical trials https://drks.de/; DRKS00027391.

Journal Title: Best practice & research. Clinical obstetrics & gynaecology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: Endometriosis is a complex chronic inflammatory process characterised by the presence of endometrial-like glandular tissue outside the uterine cavity, typically within the pelvic structures. This condition affects up to 10-15 % of women and those assigned female at birth, and can result in chronic pelvic pain and in/subfertility. Treatment goals include medical, surgical options and alternative therapies. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the currently recommended first line investigation for endometriosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reserved for those with equivocal ultrasound findings. In this paper, we aim to outline the commonly seen sonographic appearances of endometriosis divided into anterior, middle and posterior pelvic compartments. Limitations to ultrasound imaging include high operator dependence and patient factors. New imaging techniques and research into the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) into the detection of endometriosis is currently underway, with possibility of reduced diagnostic delay and better patient outcomes.

Title: Deep learning-based natural language processing for detecting medical symptoms and histories in emergency patient triage.
Author: ['Lee S', 'Lee J', 'Park J', 'Park J', 'Kim D', 'Lee J', 'Oh J']
Journal Title: The American journal of emergency medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The manual recording of electronic health records (EHRs) by clinicians in the emergency department (ED) is time-consuming and challenging. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT, this study aimed to design and validate LLMs for automatic clinical diagnoses. The models were designed to identify 12 medical symptoms and 2 patient histories from simulated clinician-patient conversations within 6 primary symptom scenarios in emergency triage rooms. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We developed classification models by fine-tuning BERT, a transformer-based pre-trained model. We subsequently analyzed these models using eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method. A Turing test was conducted to ascertain the reliability of the XAI results by comparing them to the outcomes of tasks performed and explained by medical workers. An emergency medicine specialist assessed the results of both XAI and the medical workers. RESULTS: We fine-tuned four pre-trained LLMs and compared their classification performance. The KLUE-RoBERTa-based model demonstrated the highest performance (F1-score: 0.965, AUROC: 0.893) on human-transcribed script data. The XAI results using SHAP showed an average Jaccard similarity of 0.722 when compared with explanations of medical workers for 15 samples. The Turing test results revealed a small 6% gap, with XAI and medical workers receiving the mean scores of 3.327 and 3.52, respectively. CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the potential of LLMs for automatic EHR recording in Korean EDs. The KLUE-RoBERTa-based model demonstrated superior classification performance. Furthermore, XAI using SHAP provided reliable explanations for model outputs. The reliability of these explanations was confirmed by a Turing test.

Journal Title: Journal of proteome research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: The trends of the last 20 years in biotechnology were revealed using artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) of publicly available data. Implementing this "science-of-science" approach, we capture convergent trends in the field of proteomics in both technology development and application across the phylogenetic tree of life. With major gaps in our knowledge about protein composition, structure, and location over time, we report trends in persistent, popular approaches and emerging technologies across 94 ideas from a corpus of 29 journals in PubMed over two decades. New metrics for clusters of these ideas reveal the progression and popularity of emerging approaches like single-cell, spatial, compositional, and chemical proteomics designed to better capture protein-level chemistry and biology. This analysis of the proteomics literature with advanced analytic tools quantifies the Rate of Rise for a next generation of technologies to better define, quantify, and visualize the multiple dimensions of the proteome that will transform our ability to measure and understand proteins in the coming decade.

Title: Identifying Existing Evidence to Potentially Develop a Machine Learning Diagnostic Algorithm for Cough in Primary Care Settings: Scoping Review.
Author: ['Cummerow J', 'Wienecke C', 'Engler N', 'Marahrens P', 'Gruening P', 'Steinhauser J']
Journal Title: Journal of medical Internet research
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary care is known to be one of the most complex health care settings because of the high number of theoretically possible diagnoses. Therefore, the process of clinical decision-making in primary care includes complex analytical and nonanalytical factors such as gut feelings and dealing with uncertainties. Artificial intelligence is also mandated to offer support in finding valid diagnoses. Nevertheless, to translate some aspects of what occurs during a consultation into a machine-based diagnostic algorithm, the probabilities for the underlying diagnoses (odds ratios) need to be determined. OBJECTIVE: Cough is one of the most common reasons for a consultation in general practice, the core discipline in primary care. The aim of this scoping review was to identify the available data on cough as a predictor of various diagnoses encountered in general practice. In the context of an ongoing project, we reflect on this database as a possible basis for a machine-based diagnostic algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of such an algorithm against the background of the specifics of general practice. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched with defined search terms, supplemented by the search for gray literature via the German Journal of Family Medicine until April 20, 2023. The inclusion criterion was the explicit analysis of cough as a predictor of any conceivable disease. Exclusion criteria were articles that did not provide original study results, articles in languages other than English or German, and articles that did not mention cough as a diagnostic predictor. RESULTS: In total, 1458 records were identified for screening, of which 35 articles met our inclusion criteria. Most of the results (11/35, 31%) were found for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The others were distributed among the diagnoses of asthma or unspecified obstructive airway disease, various infectious diseases, bronchogenic carcinoma, dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease, and adverse effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Positive odds ratios were found for cough as a predictor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, COVID-19 infections, and bronchial carcinoma, whereas the results for cough as a predictor of asthma and other nonspecified obstructive airway diseases were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable data on cough as a predictor of various diagnoses encountered in general practice are scarce. The example of cough does not provide a sufficient database to contribute odds to a machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm in a meaningful way.

Author: ['Chen HH', 'Hsu HT', 'Lin PC', 'Chen CY', 'Hsieh HF', 'Ko CH']
Journal Title: JMIR mental health
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence or inaccuracy in taking prescribed medications plays an important role in the recurrence or worsening of psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their medication adherence with exacerbated symptoms or relapse. The use of mobile health services increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their role in improving mental health is becoming clearer. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a smartphone app (MedAdhere) on medication adherence and accuracy among patients with schizophrenia and to measure their psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. METHODS: In this 12-week experimental study, participants were provided interventions with the MedAdhere app, and data were collected between June 2021 and September 2022. A total of 105 participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. We used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination to measure the participants' psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. Generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 94 participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the protocol, and the medication adherence rate of the experimental group was 94.72% (2785/2940) during the intervention. Psychotic symptoms (positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms) and cognitive functions (memory, language, and executive function) were significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The MedAdhere app effectively and significantly improved medication adherence and, thereby, the psychiatric symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. This artificial intelligence assisted app could be extended to all patients who need to be reminded to take medication on schedule.

Title: Effects of User-Reported Risk Factors and Follow-Up Care Activities on Satisfaction With a COVID-19 Chatbot: Cross-Sectional Study.
Author: ['Singh A', 'Schooley B', 'Patel N']
Journal Title: JMIR mHealth and uHealth
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic influenced many to consider methods to reduce human contact and ease the burden placed on health care workers. Conversational agents or chatbots are a set of technologies that may aid with these challenges. They may provide useful interactions for users, potentially reducing the health care worker burden while increasing user satisfaction. Research aims to understand these potential impacts of chatbots and conversational recommender systems and their associated design features. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate user perceptions of the helpfulness of an artificial intelligence chatbot that was offered free to the public in response to COVID-19. The chatbot engaged patients and provided educational information and the opportunity to report symptoms, understand personal risks, and receive referrals for care. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to analyze 82,222 chats collected from patients in South Carolina seeking services from the Prisma Health system. Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between reported risk factors and perceived chat helpfulness using chats started between April 24, 2020, and April 21, 2022. RESULTS: A total of 82,222 chat series were started with at least one question or response on record; 53,805 symptom checker questions with at least one COVID-19-related activity series were completed, with 5191 individuals clicking further to receive a virtual video visit and 2215 clicking further to make an appointment with a local physician. Patients who were aged >65 years (P<.001), reported comorbidities (P<.001), had been in contact with a person with COVID-19 in the last 14 days (P<.001), and responded to symptom checker questions that placed them at a higher risk of COVID-19 (P<.001) were 1.8 times more likely to report the chat as helpful than those who reported lower risk factors. Users who engaged with the chatbot to conduct a series of activities were more likely to find the chat helpful (P<.001), including seeking COVID-19 information (3.97-4.07 times), in-person appointments (2.46-1.99 times), telehealth appointments with a nearby provider (2.48-1.9 times), or vaccination (2.9-3.85 times) compared with those who did not perform any of these activities. CONCLUSIONS: Chatbots that are designed to target high-risk user groups and provide relevant actionable items may be perceived as a helpful approach to early contact with the health system for assessing communicable disease symptoms and follow-up care options at home before virtual or in-person contact with health care providers. The results identified and validated significant design factors for conversational recommender systems, including triangulating a high-risk target user population and providing relevant actionable items for users to choose from as part of user engagement.

Journal Title: Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Data generation in clinical settings is ongoing and perpetually increasing. Artificial intelligence (AI) software may help detect data-related errors or facilitate process management. The aim of the present study was to test the extent to which the frequently encountered pre-analytical, analytical, and postanalytical errors in clinical laboratories, and likely clinical diagnoses can be detected through the use of a chatbot. METHODS: A total of 20 case scenarios, 20 multiple-choice, and 20 direct questions related to errors observed in pre-analytical, analytical, and postanalytical processes were developed in English. Difficulty assessment was performed for the 60 questions. Responses by 4 chatbots to the questions were scored in a blinded manner by 3 independent laboratory experts for accuracy, usefulness, and completeness. RESULTS: According to Chi-squared test, accuracy score of ChatGPT-3.5 (54.4 %) was significantly lower than CopyAI (86.7 %) (p=0.0269) and ChatGPT v4.0. (88.9 %) (p=0.0168), respectively in cases. In direct questions, there was no significant difference between ChatGPT-3.5 (67.8 %) and WriteSonic (69.4 %), ChatGPT v4.0. (78.9 %) and CopyAI (73.9 %) (p=0.914, p=0.433 and p=0.675, respectively) accuracy scores. CopyAI (90.6 %) presented significantly better performance compared to ChatGPT-3.5 (62.2 %) (p=0.036) in multiple choice questions. CONCLUSIONS: These applications presented considerable performance to find out the cases and reply to questions. In the future, the use of AI applications is likely to increase in clinical settings if trained and validated by technical and medical experts within a structural framework.

Author: ['Smith DA', 'Burton LM', 'Amanda S']
Journal Title: Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised or has already begun to influence highly absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) science. It is not in the area expected, that of superior modelling of ADME data to increase its predictive power. It is influencing traditional exhaustive and careful literature research by providing almost perfect summaries of existing information. This will highly influence how people study, graduate and progress in the ADME sciences. The literature contains many flaws, protein binding influence on unbound drug concentration, is one of the examples cited, and without direction AI may help to popularise them.ADME science has a relatively small number of key assays and values but these are produced under widely varying conditions so large data sets, the best substrate for artificial intelligence, are not readily available to produce new more predictive systems. The use of AI to enrich the data bases may be a near term goal.AI is already contributing in other areas such as technical skill assimilation, maintenance of complex instruments (combined with virtual reality) and the processing of pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort. Here, this work develops a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel-based sensors and a self-designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multichannel EMG signals, the multimodal human-machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human-machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI-powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.
