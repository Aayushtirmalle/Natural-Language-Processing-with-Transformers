Author: ['Yang Z', 'Zhou D', 'Huang J']
Journal Title: International journal of molecular sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a type of malignant tumor with a consistently high mortality rate. The diagnosis of early-stage OC and identification of functional subsets in the tumor microenvironment are essential to the development of patient management strategies. However, the development of robust models remains unsatisfactory. We aimed to utilize artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis to address this issue. Two independent datasets were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and processed to obtain overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in stage II-IV vs. stage I diseases. Three explainable machine learning algorithms were integrated to construct models that could determine the tumor stage and extract important characteristic genes as diagnostic biomarkers. Correlations between cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration and characteristic gene expression were analyzed using TIMER2.0 and their relationship with survival rates was comprehensively explored via the Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM-plotter) online database. The specific expression of characteristic genes in fibroblast subsets was investigated through single-cell analysis. A novel fibroblast subset signature was explored to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response and oncogene mutation through Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and artificial neural network algorithms, respectively. We found that Support Vector Machine-Shapley Additive Explanations (SVM-SHAP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF) successfully diagnosed early-stage OC (stage I). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of these models exceeded 0.990. Their overlapping characteristic gene, secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was a risk factor that affected the overall survival of OC patients with stage II-IV disease (log-rank test: p < 0.01) and was specifically expressed in a fibroblast subset. Finally, the SFRP2(+) fibroblast signature served as a novel predictor in evaluating ICI response and exploring pan-cancer tumor protein P53 (TP53) mutation (AUC = 0.853, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.829-0.877). In conclusion, the models based on SVM-SHAP, XGBoost, and RF enabled the early detection of OC for clinical decision making, and SFRP2(+) fibroblast signature used in diagnostic models can inform OC treatment selection and offer pan-cancer TP53 mutation detection.

Author: ['Presern U', 'Golicnik M']
Journal Title: International journal of molecular sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Enzyme research is important for the development of various scientific fields such as medicine and biotechnology. Enzyme databases facilitate this research by providing a wide range of information relevant to research planning and data analysis. Over the years, various databases that cover different aspects of enzyme biology (e.g., kinetic parameters, enzyme occurrence, and reaction mechanisms) have been developed. Most of the databases are curated manually, which improves reliability of the information; however, such curation cannot keep pace with the exponential growth in published data. Lack of data standardization is another obstacle for data extraction and analysis. Improving machine readability of databases is especially important in the light of recent advances in deep learning algorithms that require big training datasets. This review provides information regarding the current state of enzyme databases, especially in relation to the ever-increasing amount of generated research data and recent advancements in artificial intelligence algorithms. Furthermore, it describes several enzyme databases, providing the reader with necessary information for their use.

Abstract: Photo-based dietary assessment is becoming more feasible as artificial intelligence methods improve. However, advancement of these methods for dietary assessment in research settings has been hindered by the lack of an appropriate dataset against which to benchmark algorithm performance. We conducted the Surveying Nutrient Assessment with Photographs of Meals (SNAPMe) study (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT05008653) to pair meal photographs with traditional food records. Participants were recruited nationally, and 110 enrollment meetings were completed via web-based video conferencing. Participants uploaded and annotated their meal photos using a mobile phone app called Bitesnap and completed food records using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24((R))) version 2020. Participants included photos before and after eating non-packaged and multi-serving packaged meals, as well as photos of the front and ingredient labels for single-serving packaged foods. The SNAPMe Database (DB) contains 3311 unique food photos linked with 275 ASA24 food records from 95 participants who photographed all foods consumed and recorded food records in parallel for up to 3 study days each. The use of the SNAPMe DB to evaluate ingredient prediction demonstrated that the publicly available algorithms FB Inverse Cooking and Im2Recipe performed poorly, especially for single-ingredient foods and beverages. Correlations between nutrient estimates common to the Bitesnap and ASA24 dietary assessment tools indicated a range in predictive capacity across nutrients (cholesterol, adjusted R(2) = 0.85, p < 0.0001; food folate, adjusted R(2) = 0.21, p < 0.05). SNAPMe DB is a publicly available benchmark for photo-based dietary assessment in nutrition research. Its demonstrated utility suggested areas of needed improvement, especially the prediction of single-ingredient foods and beverages.

Journal Title: Plants (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Plant physiological status is the interaction between the plant genome and the prevailing growth conditions. Accurate characterization of plant physiology is, therefore, fundamental to effective plant phenotyping studies; particularly those focused on identifying traits associated with improved yield, lower input requirements, and climate resilience. Here, we outline the approaches used to assess plant physiology and how these techniques of direct empirical observations of processes such as photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation, stomatal conductance, photosystem II electron transport, or the effectiveness of protective energy dissipation mechanisms are unsuited to high-throughput phenotyping applications. Novel optical sensors, remote/proximal sensing (multi- and hyperspectral reflectance, infrared thermography, sun-induced fluorescence), LiDAR, and automated analyses of below-ground development offer the possibility to infer plant physiological status and growth. However, there are limitations to such 'indirect' approaches to gauging plant physiology. These methodologies that are appropriate for the rapid high temporal screening of a number of crop varieties over a wide spatial scale do still require 'calibration' or 'validation' with direct empirical measurement of plant physiological status. The use of deep-learning and artificial intelligence approaches may enable the effective synthesis of large multivariate datasets to more accurately quantify physiological characters rapidly in high numbers of replicate plants. Advances in automated data collection and subsequent data processing represent an opportunity for plant phenotyping efforts to fully integrate fundamental physiological data into vital efforts to ensure food and agro-economic sustainability.

Author: ['Marek K', 'Redlicka J', 'Miller E', 'Zubrycki I']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: There is a wide variety of tools and measures for rehabilitation outcomes in post-stroke patients with impairments in the upper limb and hand, such as paralysis, paresis, flaccidity, and spasticity. However, there is a lack of general recommendations for selecting the most appropriate scales, tests, and instruments to objectively evaluate therapy outcomes. Reviews on upper limb and hand measurements reveal that clinicians' choices of tools and methods are highly varied. Some clinicians and medical teams continue to employ non-standard and unverified metrics in their research and measurements. This review article aims to identify the key parameters, assessed by outcome measures and instruments, that play a crucial role in upper limb and hand rehabilitation for post-stroke patients, specifically focusing on the recovery of hand function. The review seeks to assist researchers and medical teams in selecting appropriate outcome measures when evaluating post-stroke patients. We analyze the measured factors and skills found in these outcome measures and highlight useful tools that diversify assessments and enhance result objectivity through graphical representation. The paper also describes trends and new possibilities in hand outcome measures. Clinicians frequently use proven devices, such as EMG, goniometers, and hand dynamometers. Still, there is a growing trend towards incorporating technologies, such as pose and position estimation, using artificial intelligence, or custom hand grip measurement devices. Researchers are increasingly adopting scales previously successful in orthopedic and surgical patients, recognizing their potential for objectivizing outcomes in neurological patients with post-stroke hand complications. The review included only adults over the age of 18. Outcome measures were tested for usefulness in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.

Title: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Pancreatic Cancer Care: Early Detection, Liquid Biopsies, Precision Medicine and Artificial Intelligence.
Author: ['Daamen LA', 'Molenaar IQ', 'Groot VP']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: The incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is rising. While surgical techniques and peri-operative care have improved, the overall survival for PDAC remains poor. Thus, novel and bold research initiatives are needed along the spectrum of clinical care, a few of which will be discussed in this article. Early detection is crucial, with specific high-risk groups possibly benefiting from targeted screening programs. Liquid biopsies (such as circulating exosomes, tumor DNA, or tumor cells) offer promise as multifunctional biomarkers for early detection, treatment guidance, and recurrence monitoring. Precision medicine is being explored via targeted therapies for actionable mutations, such as PARP inhibitors for BRCA mutations, and immunotherapy strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool in medical imaging, biomarker discovery, genetics research, and treatment planning, and it can aid in diagnosis, treatment selection, and patient monitoring. However, its associated challenges include ethics, data security, algorithm reliability, and validation. Collaborative efforts between medical professionals, researchers, and AI experts are vital for unlocking AI's potential to enhance pancreatic cancer care. In conclusion, despite the challenges, advancements in liquid biopsies, precision medicine, and AI offer hope for enhancing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pancreatic cancer.

Title: Introduction of Deep Learning-Based Infrared Image Analysis to Marginal Reflex Distance1 Measurement Method to Simultaneously Capture Images and Compute Results: Clinical Validation Study.
Author: ['Song B', 'Kwon H', 'Kim S', 'Ha Y', 'Oh SH', 'Song SH']
Journal Title: Journal of clinical medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: Marginal reflex distance1 (MRD1) is a crucial clinical tool used to evaluate the position of the eyelid margin in relation to the cornea. Traditionally, this assessment has been conducted manually by plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, or trained technicians. However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, there is a growing interest in the development of automated systems capable of accurately measuring MRD1. In this context, we introduce novel MRD1 measurement methods based on deep learning algorithms that can simultaneously capture images and compute the results. This prospective observational study involved 154 eyes of 77 patients aged over 18 years who visited Chungnam National University Hospital between 1 January 2023 and 29 July 2023. We collected four different MRD1 datasets from patients using three distinct measurement methods, each tailored to the individual patient. The mean MRD1 values, measured through the manual method using a penlight, the deep learning method, ImageJ analysis from RGB eye images, and ImageJ analysis from IR eye images in 56 eyes of 28 patients, were 2.64 +/- 1.04 mm, 2.85 +/- 1.07 mm, 2.78 +/- 1.08 mm, and 3.07 +/- 0.95 mm, respectively. Notably, the strongest agreement was observed between MRD1_deep learning (DL) and MRD1_IR (0.822, p < 0.01). In a Bland-Altman plot, the smallest difference was observed between MRD1_DL and MRD1_IR ImageJ, with a mean difference of 0.0611 and DeltaLOA (limits of agreement) of 2.5162, which was the smallest among all of the groups. In conclusion, this novel MRD1 measurement method, based on an IR camera and deep learning, demonstrates statistical significance and can be readily applied in clinical settings.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: Scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity of lateral bending and rotation of the spine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of theories and techniques for studying artificial intelligence, which realizes machine intelligence by simulating and expanding human intelligence. With the continuous development of the multidisciplinary integration trend of modern medicine, artificial intelligence is used more and more in the diagnosis and treatment of scoliosis. Artificial intelligence has been widely used in the study of scoliosis and has penetrated into all fields of clinical practice of scoliosis. At present, artificial intelligence has shown good application prospects in early screening, diagnosis, treatment decision making, intraoperative operation, and prognosis prediction of scoliosis. This paper mainly summarizes the application of artificial intelligence in the clinical practice of scoliosis, and briefly introduces the AI model and its specific applications. In addition, this paper also discusses the limitations and future development of artificial intelligence. In the future, artificial intelligence will bring greater convenience to the diagnosis and treatment of scoliosis and provide better therapeutic effects for patients.

Abstract: The concept of machines learning and acting like humans is what is meant by the phrase "artificial intelligence" (AI). Several branches of dentistry are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The literature usually focuses on AI models. These AI models have been used to detect and diagnose a wide range of conditions, including, but not limited to, dental caries, vertical root fractures, apical lesions, diseases of the salivary glands, maxillary sinusitis, maxillofacial cysts, cervical lymph node metastasis, osteoporosis, cancerous lesions, alveolar bone loss, the need for orthodontic extractions or treatments, cephalometric analysis, age and gender determination, and more. The primary contemporary applications of AI in the dental field are in undergraduate teaching and research. Before these methods can be used in everyday dentistry, however, the underlying technology and user interfaces need to be refined.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Addressing intraoperative bleeding remains a significant challenge in the field of robotic surgery. This research endeavors to pioneer a groundbreaking solution utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The objective is to establish a system capable of forecasting instances of intraoperative bleeding during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and promptly notify the surgeon about bleeding risks. METHODS: To achieve this, a multi-task learning (MTL) CNN was introduced, leveraging a modified version of the U-Net architecture. The aim was to categorize video input as either "absence of blood accumulation" (0) or "presence of blood accumulation" (1). To facilitate seamless interaction with the neural networks, the Bleeding Artificial Intelligence-based Detector (BLAIR) software was created using the Python Keras API and built upon the PyQT framework. A subsequent clinical assessment of BLAIR's efficacy was performed, comparing its bleeding identification performance against that of a urologist. Various perioperative variables were also gathered. For optimal MTL-CNN training parameterization, a multi-task loss function was adopted to enhance the accuracy of event detection by taking advantage of surgical tools' semantic segmentation. Additionally, the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) approach was employed to assess software performance. RESULTS: The MTL-CNN demonstrated a remarkable event recognition accuracy of 90.63%. When evaluating BLAIR's predictive ability and its capacity to pre-warn surgeons of potential bleeding incidents, the density plot highlighted a striking similarity between BLAIR and human assessments. In fact, BLAIR exhibited a faster response. Notably, the MCA analysis revealed no discernible distinction between the software and human performance in accurately identifying instances of bleeding. CONCLUSION: The BLAIR software proved its competence by achieving over 90% accuracy in predicting bleeding events during RARP. This accomplishment underscores the potential of AI to assist surgeons during interventions. This study exemplifies the positive impact AI applications can have on surgical procedures.

Abstract: Vascular inflammation is recognized as the primary trigger of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, current noninvasive methods are not capable of accurately detecting coronary inflammation. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT), in addition to their role as an energy reserve system, have been found to contribute to the development and progression of coronary artery calcification, inflammation, and plaque vulnerability. They also participate in the vascular response during ischemia, sympathetic stimuli, and arrhythmia. As a result, the evaluation of EAT and PCAT using imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and nuclear imaging has gained significant attention. PCAT-CT attenuation, which measures the average CT attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) of the adipose tissue, reflects adipocyte differentiation/size and leukocyte infiltration. It is emerging as a marker of tissue inflammation and has shown prognostic value in coronary artery disease (CAD), being associated with plaque development, vulnerability, and rupture. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), an inflammatory pericoronary microenvironment promoted by dysfunctional EAT/PCAT has been demonstrated, and more recently, it has been associated with plaque rupture in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Endothelial dysfunction, known for its detrimental effects on coronary vessels and its association with plaque progression, is bidirectionally linked to PCAT. PCAT modulates the secretory profile of endothelial cells in response to inflammation and also plays a crucial role in regulating vascular tone in the coronary district. Consequently, dysregulated PCAT has been hypothesized to contribute to type 2 myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and coronary vasculitis. Recently, quantitative measures of EAT derived from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have been included in artificial intelligence (AI) models for cardiovascular risk stratification. These models have shown incremental utility in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared to plaque characteristics alone. Therefore, the analysis of PCAT and EAT, particularly through PCAT-CT attenuation, appears to be a safe, valuable, and sufficiently specific noninvasive method for accurately identifying coronary inflammation and subsequent high-risk plaque. These findings are supported by biopsy and in vivo evidence. Although speculative, these pieces of evidence open the door for a fascinating new strategy in cardiovascular risk stratification. The incorporation of PCAT and EAT analysis, mainly through PCAT-CT attenuation, could potentially lead to improved risk stratification and guide early targeted primary prevention and intensive secondary prevention in patients at higher risk of cardiac events.

Title: Anomaly Detection Based on a 3D Convolutional Neural Network Combining Convolutional Block Attention Module Using Merged Frames.
Author: ['Hwang IC', 'Kang HS']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: With the recent rise in violent crime, the real-time situation analysis capabilities of the prevalent closed-circuit television have been employed for the deterrence and resolution of criminal activities. Anomaly detection can identify abnormal instances such as violence within the patterns of a specified dataset; however, it faces challenges in that the dataset for abnormal situations is smaller than that for normal situations. Herein, using datasets such as UBI-Fights, RWF-2000, and UCSD Ped1 and Ped2, anomaly detection was approached as a binary classification problem. Frames extracted from each video with annotation were reconstructed into a limited number of images of 3x3, 4x3, 4x4, 5x3 sizes using the method proposed in this paper, forming an input data structure similar to a light field and patch of vision transformer. The model was constructed by applying a convolutional block attention module that included channel and spatial attention modules to a residual neural network with depths of 10, 18, 34, and 50 in the form of a three-dimensional convolution. The proposed model performed better than existing models in detecting abnormal behavior such as violent acts in videos. For instance, with the undersampled UBI-Fights dataset, our network achieved an accuracy of 0.9933, a loss value of 0.0010, an area under the curve of 0.9973, and an equal error rate of 0.0027. These results may contribute significantly to solve real-world issues such as the detection of violent behavior in artificial intelligence systems using computer vision and real-time video monitoring.

Title: BezierCE: Low-Light Image Enhancement via Zero-Reference Bezier Curve Estimation.
Author: ['Gao X', 'Zhao K', 'Han L', 'Luo J']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 3
Abstract: Due to problems such as the shooting light, viewing angle, and camera equipment, low-light images with low contrast, color distortion, high noise, and unclear details can be seen regularly in real scenes. These low-light images will not only affect our observation but will also greatly affect the performance of computer vision processing algorithms. Low-light image enhancement technology can help to improve the quality of images and make them more applicable to fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance images through Bezier curve estimation. We estimate the pixel-level Bezier curve by training a deep neural network (BCE-Net) to adjust the dynamic range of a given image. Based on the good properties of the Bezier curve, in that it is smooth, continuous, and differentiable everywhere, low-light image enhancement through Bezier curve mapping is effective. The advantages of BCE-Net's brevity and zero-reference make it generalizable to other low-light conditions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Within the broader context of improving interactions between artificial intelligence and humans, the question has arisen regarding whether auditory and rhythmic support could increase attention for visual stimuli that do not stand out clearly from an information stream. To this end, we designed an experiment inspired by pip-and-pop but more appropriate for eliciting attention and P3a-event-related potentials (ERPs). In this study, the aim was to distinguish between targets and distractors based on the subject's electroencephalography (EEG) data. We achieved this objective by employing different machine learning (ML) methods for both individual-subject (IS) and cross-subject (CS) models. Finally, we investigated which EEG channels and time points were used by the model to make its predictions using saliency maps. We were able to successfully perform the aforementioned classification task for both the IS and CS scenarios, reaching classification accuracies up to 76%. In accordance with the literature, the model primarily used the parietal-occipital electrodes between 200 ms and 300 ms after the stimulus to make its prediction. The findings from this research contribute to the development of more effective P300-based brain-computer interfaces. Furthermore, they validate the EEG data collected in our experiment.

Abstract: The proliferation and great variety of low-cost air quality (AQ) sensors, combined with their flexibility and energy efficiency, gives an opportunity to integrate them into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). However, with these sensors, AQ monitoring poses a significant challenge, as the data collection and analysis process is complex and prone to errors. Although these sensors do not meet the performance requirements for reference regulatory-equivalent monitoring, they can provide informative measurements and more if we can adjust and add further processing to their raw measurements. Therefore, the integration of these sensors aims to facilitate real-time monitoring and achieve a higher spatial and temporal sampling density, particularly in urban areas, where there is a strong interest in providing AQ surveillance services since there is an increase in respiratory/allergic issues among the population. Leveraging a network of low-cost sensors, supported by 5G communications in combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (using Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNN and DNN)) to predict 24-h-ahead readings is the goal of this article in order to be able to provide early warnings to the populations of hazards areas. We have evaluated four different neural network architectures: Multi-Linear prediction (with a dense Multi-Linear Neural Network (NN)), Multi-Dense network prediction, Multi-Convolutional network prediction, and Multi-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network prediction. To perform the training of the prediction of the readings, we have prepared a significant dataset that is analyzed and processed for training and testing, achieving an estimation error for most of the predicted parameters of around 7.2% on average, with the best option being the Multi-LSTM network in the forthcoming 24 h. It is worth mentioning that some pollutants achieved lower estimation errors, such as CO2 with 0.1%, PM10 with 2.4% (as well as PM2.5 and PM1.0), and NO2 with 6.7%.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled human-centered smart healthcare monitoring system can be useful in life saving, specifically for diabetes patients. Diabetes and heart patients need real-time and remote monitoring and recommendation-based medical assistance. Such human-centered smart healthcare systems can not only provide continuous medical assistance to diabetes patients but can also reduce overall medical expenses. In the last decade, machine learning has been successfully implemented to design more accurate and precise medical applications. In this paper, a smart sensing technologies-based architecture is proposed that uses AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) for continuous monitoring and health assistance for diabetes patients. The designed system senses various health parameters, such as blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose (non-invasively), body temperature, and pulse rate, using a wrist band. We also designed a non-invasive blood sugar sensor using a near-infrared (NIR) sensor. The proposed system can predict the patient's health condition, which is evaluated by a set of machine learning algorithms with the support of a fuzzy logic decision-making system. The designed system was validated on a large data set of 50 diabetes patients. The results of the simulation manifest that the random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy in comparison to other machine learning algorithms. The system predicts the patient's condition accurately and sends it to the doctor's portal.

Title: Rapid Determination of Wine Grape Maturity Level from pH, Titratable Acidity, and Sugar Content Using Non-Destructive In Situ Infrared Spectroscopy and Multi-Head Attention Convolutional Neural Networks.

Abstract: In the pursuit of enhancing the wine production process through the utilization of new technologies in viticulture, this study presents a novel approach for the rapid assessment of wine grape maturity levels using non-destructive, in situ infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence techniques. Building upon our previous work focused on estimating sugar content ( composite functionBrix) from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions, this research expands its scope to encompass pH and titratable acidity, critical parameters determining the grape maturity degree, and in turn, wine quality, offering a more representative estimation pathway. Data were collected from four grape varieties-Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon Blanc, and Syrah-during the 2023 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages in the vineyards of Ktima Gerovassiliou, northern Greece. A comprehensive spectral library was developed, covering the VNIR-SWIR spectrum (350-2500 nm), with measurements performed in situ. Ground truth data for pH, titratable acidity, and sugar content were obtained using conventional laboratory methods: total soluble solids (TSS) ( composite functionBrix) by refractometry, titratable acidity by titration (expressed as mg tartaric acid per liter of must) and pH by a pH meter, analyzed at different maturation stages in the must samples. The maturity indicators were predicted from the point hyperspectral data by employing machine learning algorithms, including Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in conjunction with various pre-processing techniques. Multi-output models were also considered to simultaneously predict all three indicators to exploit their intercorrelations. A novel multi-input-multi-output CNN model was also proposed, incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism and enabling the identification of the spectral regions it focuses on, and thus having a higher interpretability degree. Our results indicate high accuracy in the estimation of sugar content, pH, and titratable acidity, with the best models yielding mean R2 values of 0.84, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively, across all properties. The multi-output models did not improve the prediction results compared to the best single-output models, and the proposed CNN model was on par with the next best model. The interpretability analysis highlighted that the CNN model focused on spectral regions associated with the presence of sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose) and of the carboxylic acid group. This study underscores the potential of portable spectrometry for real-time, non-destructive assessments of wine grape maturity, thereby providing valuable tools for informed decision making in the wine production industry. By integrating pH and titratable acidity into the analysis, our approach offers a holistic view of grape quality, facilitating more comprehensive and efficient viticultural practices.

Title: A Bibliometric Analysis of Neuroscience Tools Use in Construction Health and Safety Management.
Author: ['Ding Z', 'Xiong Z', 'Ouyang Y']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: Despite longstanding traditional construction health and safety management (CHSM) methods, the construction industry continues to face persistent challenges in this field. Neuroscience tools offer potential advantages in addressing these safety and health issues by providing objective data to indicate subjects' cognition and behavior. The application of neuroscience tools in the CHSM has received much attention in the construction research community, but comprehensive statistics on the application of neuroscience tools to CHSM is lacking to provide insights for the later scholars. Therefore, this study applied bibliometric analysis to examine the current state of neuroscience tools use in CHSM. The development phases; the most productive journals, regions, and institutions; influential scholars and articles; author collaboration; reference co-citation; and application domains of the tools were identified. It revealed four application domains: monitoring the safety status of construction workers, enhancing the construction hazard recognition ability, reducing work-related musculoskeletal disorders of construction workers, and integrating neuroscience tools with artificial intelligence techniques in enhancing occupational safety and health, where magnetoencephalography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and electrodermal activity (EDA) are four predominant neuroscience tools. It also shows a growing interest in integrating the neuroscience tools with artificial intelligence techniques to address the safety and health issues. In addition, future studies are suggested to facilitate the applications of these tools in construction workplaces by narrowing the gaps between experimental settings and real situations, enhancing the quality of data collected by neuroscience tools and performance of data processing algorithms, and overcoming user resistance in tools adoption.
