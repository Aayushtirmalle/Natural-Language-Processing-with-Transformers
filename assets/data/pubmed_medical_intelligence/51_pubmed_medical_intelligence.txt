Journal Title: Hematology reports
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 26
Abstract: In Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (LLA), growing evidence has accumulated regarding the efficacy of low-intensity and chemo-free regimens. Our objective was to analyze all recent trials evaluating these treatments and to compare them in terms of efficacy. We applied the Shiny method, an artificial intelligence technique, to analyze Kaplan-Meier curves and reconstruct patient-level data. Reconstructed patient data were then evaluated through standard survival statistics and subjected to indirect head-to-head treatment comparisons. The endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Based on 432 reconstructed patients, eight trials were analyzed. The survival data from these trials were pooled into three types of treatments: (i) treatments based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) combined with reduced-intensity chemotherapy (denoted as TKICHE); (ii) TKIs associated with steroids with no chemotherapy (TKISTE); (iii) chemotherapy-free combinations of blinatumomab plus TKIs (TKIBLI). According to the Shiny method, the three PFS curves were reported in a single Kaplan-Meier graph and subjected to survival statistics. In terms of PFS, TKIBLI ranked first, TKICHE second, and TKISTE third; the differences between these three regimens were statistically significant. This multi-treatment Kaplan-Meier graph, generated through the Shiny method, summarized the current evidence on these treatments in both qualitative and quantitative terms.

Author: ['Gallos IK', 'Tryfonopoulos D', 'Shani G', 'Amditis A', 'Haick H', 'Dionysiou DD']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer is crucial for improving outcomes and reducing mortality. While there is strong evidence of effectiveness, currently adopted screening methods present several shortcomings which negatively impact the detection of early stage carcinogenesis, including low uptake due to patient discomfort. As a result, developing novel, non-invasive alternatives is an important research priority. Recent advancements in the field of breathomics, the study of breath composition and analysis, have paved the way for new avenues for non-invasive cancer detection and effective monitoring. Harnessing the utility of Volatile Organic Compounds in exhaled breath, breathomics has the potential to disrupt colorectal cancer screening practices. Our goal is to outline key research efforts in this area focusing on machine learning methods used for the analysis of breathomics data, highlight challenges involved in artificial intelligence application in this context, and suggest possible future directions which are currently considered within the framework of the European project ONCOSCREEN.

Author: ['Lee KH', 'Lee RW', 'Lee KH', 'Park W', 'Kwon SR', 'Lim MJ']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: PURPOSE: Sacroiliitis refers to the inflammatory condition of the sacroiliac joints, frequently causing lower back pain. It is often associated with systemic conditions. However, its signs on radiographic images can be subtle, which may result in it being overlooked or underdiagnosed. This study aims to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to create a diagnostic tool for more accurate sacroiliitis detection in radiological images, with the goal of optimizing treatment plans and improving patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study included 492 patients who visited our hospital. Right sacroiliac joint films were independently evaluated by two musculoskeletal radiologists using the Modified New York criteria (Normal, Grades 1-4). A consensus reading resolved disagreements. The images were preprocessed with Z-score standardization and histogram equalization. The DenseNet121 algorithm, a convolutional neural network with 201 layers, was used for learning and classification. All steps were performed on the DEEP:PHI platform. RESULT: The AI model exhibited high accuracy across different grades: 94.53% (Grade 1), 95.83% (Grade 2), 98.44% (Grade 3), 96.88% (Grade 4), and 96.09% (Normal cases). Sensitivity peaked at Grade 3 and Normal cases (100%), while Grade 4 achieved perfect specificity (100%). PPVs ranged from 82.61% (Grade 1) to 100% (Grade 4), and NPVs peaked at 100% for Grade 3 and Normal cases. The F1 scores ranged from 64.41% (Grade 1) to 95.38% (Grade 3). CONCLUSIONS: The AI diagnostic model showcased a robust performance in detecting and grading sacroiliitis, reflecting its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. By facilitating earlier and more accurate diagnoses, this model could substantially impact treatment strategies and patient outcomes.

Abstract: The surge in the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has permeated many aspects of our life, and health care is no exception. Whereas this technology can offer clear benefits, some of the problems associated with its use have also been recognised and brought into question, for example, its environmental impact. In a similar fashion, health care also has a significant environmental impact, and it requires a considerable source of greenhouse gases. Whereas efforts are being made to reduce the footprint of AI tools, here, we were specifically interested in how employing AI tools in gastroenterology departments, and in particular in conjunction with capsule endoscopy, can reduce the carbon footprint associated with digestive health care while offering improvements, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. We address the different ways that leveraging AI applications can reduce the carbon footprint associated with all types of capsule endoscopy examinations. Moreover, we contemplate how the incorporation of other technologies, such as blockchain technology, into digestive health care can help ensure the sustainability of this clinical speciality and by extension, health care in general.

Title: Deep Learning and Gastric Cancer: Systematic Review of AI-Assisted Endoscopy.
Author: ['Klang E', 'Sourosh A', 'Nadkarni GN', 'Sharif K', 'Lahat A']
Journal Title: Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC), a significant health burden worldwide, is typically diagnosed in the advanced stages due to its non-specific symptoms and complex morphological features. Deep learning (DL) has shown potential for improving and standardizing early GC detection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current status of DL in pre-malignant, early-stage, and gastric neoplasia analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE for original studies implementing DL algorithms for gastric neoplasia detection using endoscopic images. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The focus was on studies providing quantitative diagnostic performance measures and those comparing AI performance with human endoscopists. RESULTS: Our review encompasses 42 studies that utilize a variety of DL techniques. The findings demonstrate the utility of DL in GC classification, detection, tumor invasion depth assessment, cancer margin delineation, lesion segmentation, and detection of early-stage and pre-malignant lesions. Notably, DL models frequently matched or outperformed human endoscopists in diagnostic accuracy. However, heterogeneity in DL algorithms, imaging techniques, and study designs precluded a definitive conclusion about the best algorithmic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The promise of artificial intelligence in improving and standardizing gastric neoplasia detection, diagnosis, and segmentation is significant. This review is limited by predominantly single-center studies and undisclosed datasets used in AI training, impacting generalizability and demographic representation. Further, retrospective algorithm training may not reflect actual clinical performance, and a lack of model details hinders replication efforts. More research is needed to substantiate these findings, including larger-scale multi-center studies, prospective clinical trials, and comprehensive technical reporting of DL algorithms and datasets, particularly regarding the heterogeneity in DL algorithms and study designs.

Title: Challenges of Teleneurology in the Care of Complex Neurodegenerative Disorders: The Case of Parkinson's Disease with Possible Solutions.
Author: ['Fereshtehnejad SM', 'Lokk J']
Journal Title: Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 17
Abstract: Teleneurology is a specialist field within the realm of telemedicine, which is dedicated to delivering neurological care and consultations through virtual encounters. Teleneurology has been successfully used in acute care (e.g., stroke) and outpatient evaluation for chronic neurological conditions such as epilepsy and headaches. However, for some neurologic entities like Parkinson's disease, in which an in-depth physical examination by palpating muscles and performing neurologic maneuvers is the mainstay of monitoring the effects of medication, the yield and feasibility of a virtual encounter are low. Therefore, in this prospective review, we discuss two promising teleneurology approaches and propose adjustments to enhance the value of virtual encounters by improving the validity of neurological examination: 'hybrid teleneurology', which involves revising the workflow of virtual encounters; and 'artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted teleneurology', namely the use of biosensors and wearables and data processing using AI.

Title: Towards Non-Invasive and Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring in Neonatal Intensive Care Using Artificial Intelligence: A Narrative Review.
Author: ['Baker S', 'Yogavijayan T', 'Kandasamy Y']
Journal Title: Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: Preterm birth is a live birth that occurs before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Approximately 11% of babies are born preterm annually worldwide. Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for managing the haemodynamic stability of preterm infants and impacts outcomes. However, current methods have many limitations associated, including invasive measurement, inaccuracies, and infection risk. In this narrative review, we find that artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising tool for the continuous measurement of BP in a neonatal cohort, based on data obtained from non-invasive sensors. Our findings highlight key sensing technologies, AI techniques, and model assessment metrics for BP sensing in the neonatal cohort. Moreover, our findings show that non-invasive BP monitoring leveraging AI has shown promise in adult cohorts but has not been broadly explored for neonatal cohorts. We conclude that there is a significant research opportunity in developing an innovative approach to provide a non-invasive alternative to existing continuous BP monitoring methods, which has the potential to improve outcomes for premature babies.

Title: Nanowire-Enhanced Fully Transparent and Flexible Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide Transistors with Chitosan Hydrogel Gate Dielectric: A Pathway to Improved Synaptic Properties.
Author: ['Lee DH', 'Park H', 'Cho WJ']
Journal Title: Gels (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 27
Abstract: In this study, a transparent and flexible synaptic transistor was fabricated based on a random-network nanowire (NW) channel made of indium gallium zinc oxide. This device employs a biocompatible chitosan-based hydrogel as an electrolytic gate dielectric. The NW structure, with its high surface-to-volume ratio, facilitated a more effective modulation of the channel conductance induced by protonic-ion polarization. A comparative analysis of the synaptic properties of NW- and film-type devices revealed the distinctive features of the NW-type configuration. In particular, the NW-type synaptic transistors exhibited a significantly larger hysteresis window under identical gate-bias conditions. Notably, these transistors demonstrated enhanced paired-pulse facilitation properties, synaptic weight modulation, and transition from short- to long-term memory. The NW-type devices displayed gradual potentiation and depression of the channel conductance and thus achieved a broader dynamic range, improved linearity, and reduced power consumption compared with their film-type counterparts. Remarkably, the NW-type synaptic transistors exhibited impressive recognition accuracy outcomes in Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern-recognition simulations. This characteristic enhances the efficiency of practical artificial intelligence (AI) processes. Consequently, the proposed NW-type synaptic transistor is expected to emerge as a superior candidate for use in high-efficiency artificial neural network systems, thus making it a promising technology for next-generation AI semiconductor applications.

Title: Digitally Assisted Mindfulness in Training Self-Regulation Skills for Sustainable Mental Health: A Systematic Review.
Author: ['Mitsea E', 'Drigas A', 'Skianis C']
Journal Title: Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for mental health interventions, with a special focus on digitally assisted ones. Self-regulation describes a set of meta-skills that enable one to take control over his/her mental health and it is recognized as a vital indicator of well-being. Mindfulness training is a promising training strategy for promoting self-regulation, behavioral change, and mental well-being. A growing body of research outlines that smart technologies are ready to revolutionize the way mental health training programs take place. Artificial intelligence (AI); extended reality (XR) including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR); as well as the advancements in brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are ready to transform these mental health training programs. Mindfulness-based interventions assisted by smart technologies for mental, emotional, and behavioral regulation seem to be a crucial yet under-investigated issue. The current systematic review paper aims to explore whether and how smart technologies can assist mindfulness training for the development of self-regulation skills among people at risk of mental health issues as well as populations with various clinical characteristics. The PRISMA 2020 methodology was utilized to respond to the objectives and research questions using a total of sixty-six experimental studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that digitally assisted mindfulness interventions supported by smart technologies, including AI-based applications, chatbots, virtual coaches, immersive technologies, and brain-sensing headbands, can effectively assist trainees in developing a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral self-regulation skills, leading to a greater satisfaction of their psychological needs, and thus mental wellness. These results may provide positive feedback for developing smarter and more inclusive training environments, with a special focus on people with special training needs or disabilities.

Title: Validation of the Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq) in Arabic.
Author: ['Farran N', 'Darwish H']
Journal Title: Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: Cognitive reserve is the adaptability of cognitive processes in the face of brain aging and pathology. This study aimed to validate the Arabic version of the Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq) in a healthy Lebanese sample. CRIq assesses cognitive reserve through three domains: education, working activity, and leisure time. Statistical measures, including descriptive and regression analysis along with structural equation modeling, were utilized to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of the CRIq, incorporating fluid intelligence (Gf) and measures of cognitive function, long-term memory encoding and retrieval (Glr), and processing speed (Gs). Results from 174 participants revealed that the activities assessed by the CRIq-Arabic were comparable to the original CRIq study, with slight cultural differences. The internal consistency of the CRIq-Arabic was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88), indicating reliability. Convergent validity was confirmed, with moderate to high loadings on the cognitive reserve latent construct. Discriminant validity was supported as correlations between cognitive reserve variables and non-target constructs (Gf, Glr, and Gs) were less than 1. The findings provide an initial psychometric validation of the CRIq-Arabic. Further research of clinical samples is needed to enhance its utility in neuropsychological practice.

Title: Relationships between Math Skills, Motor Skills, Physical Activity, and Obesity in Typically Developing Preschool Children.
Author: ['Flores P', 'Coelho E', 'Mourao-Carvalhal I', 'Forte P']
Journal Title: Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: There is evidence of a relationship between motor and cognitive development. The literature has shown that of all the motor skills, fine motor skills are those that contribute most to mathematical performance in preschool children. As this is a sensitive period in the development of motor skills, low levels of physical activity in this period can compromise their development and contribute to weight gain and obesity. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the relationship between mathematical and motor skills, physical activity levels, and obesity. The sample consisted of 62 preschool children (32 males) with an average age of 4.63 +/- 0.81. The Weschler preschool and primary scale of intelligence-revised arithmetic test was used to assess mathematical skills. The tests to assess fine motor skills were the "Adapted Threading Beads Test" and the "Adapted Visuomotor Integration Test". The movement assessment battery for children-2, band 1, "Aiming & Catching", and "Balance" tests were used to assess gross motor skills. Levels of physical activity were assessed using the "Preschool-age physical activity questionnaire" and obesity using the body mass index. The results indicated that only the fine motor skills of visuomotor integration were included in the multiple linear regression model (F < 0.001; r = 0.464; R(2) = 0.215; p < 0.001), with the exclusion of gross motor skills, physical activity levels, and obesity levels. Thus, it was concluded that mathematical skills were only directly and significantly influenced by visuomotor integration. However, visuomotor integration was positively and significantly associated with gross motor skills (r = 0.269; p < 0.05) and not with levels of physical activity and obesity. Thus, gross motor skills could contribute to improving visuomotor integration directly and consequently mathematical skills indirectly. The results of this study suggest that the implementation of structured physical activity programs can contribute to mathematical performance.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 4
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sleep disorders and associated factors in patients with rheumatoid-arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). METHODS: We performed an observational study of 35 patients with RA-ILD (cases) and 35 age- and sex-matched RA patients without ILD (controls). We evaluated sleep disorders (Oviedo Sleep Questionnaire), positive psychological factors (resilience using the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale, emotional intelligence using the 24-item Trait Meta-Mood Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (36-item short-form survey), and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Questionnaire). Other variables studied included the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and RA activity according to the DAS28-ESR. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the cases were characterized by poorer sleep quality with a higher prevalence of insomnia (42% vs. 20%; p = 0.039), greater severity of insomnia (p = 0.001), and lower sleep satisfaction (p = 0.033). They also had poorer resilience and emotional recovery and more severe anxiety and depression. A diagnosis of ILD was the only factor independently associated with the three dimensions of sleep quality. The predictors of poorer sleep satisfaction in patients with RA-ILD were age (beta = -0.379), DAS28-ESR (beta = -0.331), and usual interstitial pneumonia pattern (beta = -0.438). The predictors of insomnia were DAS28-ESR (beta = 0.294), resilience (beta = -0.352), and CCI (beta = 0.377). CONCLUSIONS: RA-ILD is associated with significant sleep disorders. RA-ILD seems to be an independent risk factor for sleep alterations, with a greater impact on insomnia. Age, disease activity, and comorbidity also play a role in sleep disorders in patients with RA-ILD.

Author: ['Lockie E', 'Choi J']
Journal Title: ANZ journal of surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in all aspects of life in information compilation and writing, and this includes healthcare. This study aimed to evaluate a Chat GPT generated patient information leaflet (PIL) against a surgeon generated version, in order to explore a potential application of this artificial intelligence language processing model. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, undertaken May to June 2023, asking two cohorts (patients and doctors) to complete a questionnaire evaluating a Chat GPT generated PIL and a surgeon generated PIL about laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were having laparoscopic cholecystectomy at large private Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, and doctors were recruited from this hospital and a public quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The study included a convenience sample of 28 patients and 16 doctors. The main outcome measure was a questionnaire (maximum score out of 8) based on validated evaluation instrument for PILs. RESULTS: The study recruited 28 patients and 15 doctors to complete the questionnaire. The Chat GPT and surgeon generated PILs were scored similarly by patients (median 8 for both PIL; mean 7.5 for Chat GPT PIL vs. 7.1 for surgeon PIL). Doctors also scored both versions similarly, with slightly higher scores for Chat GPT over surgeon version (median 7 vs. 6; mean 6.7 vs. 5.6, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Chat GPT generated PIL was assessed as being as good or slightly better than the surgeon generated version. This study shows that PIL are a feasible application of AI language processing models.
