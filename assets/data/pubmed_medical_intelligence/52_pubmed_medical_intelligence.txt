Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Gait is an important basic function of human beings and an integral part of life. Many mental and physical abnormalities can cause noticeable differences in a person's gait. Abnormal gait can lead to serious consequences such as falls, limited mobility and reduced life satisfaction. Gait analysis, which includes joint kinematics, kinetics, and dynamic Electromyography (EMG) data, is now recognized as a clinically useful tool that can provide both quantifiable and qualitative information on performance to aid in treatment planning and evaluate its outcome. With the assistance of new artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the traditional medical environment has undergone great changes. AI has the potential to reshape medicine, making gait analysis more accurate, efficient and accessible. In this study, we analyzed basic information about gait analysis and AI articles that met inclusion criteria in the WoS Core Collection database from 1992-2022, and the VosViewer software was used for web visualization and keyword analysis. Through bibliometric and visual analysis, this article systematically introduces the research status of gait analysis and AI. We introduce the application of artificial intelligence in clinical gait analysis, which affects the identification and management of gait abnormalities found in various diseases. Machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the most often utilized AI methods in gait analysis. By comparing the predictive capability of different AI algorithms in published studies, we evaluate their potential for gait analysis in different situations. Furthermore, the current challenges and future directions of gait analysis and AI research are discussed, which will also provide valuable reference information for investors in this field.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intraoperative video recordings are a valuable addition to operative written documentation. However, the review of these videos often requires surgical expertise and takes considerable time. While a large amount of work has been undertaken to understand the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare more generally, the application of these techniques to automate the analysis of surgical videos is currently unclear. In this systematic scoping review, we sought to give a contemporary overview of the use of AI research in the analysis of digital videos of invasive general surgical procedures. We will describe and summarise the study characteristics, purpose of the applications and stage of development, to ascertain how these techniques might be applied in future research and to identify gaps in current knowledge (e.g. uncertainties about the study methods). METHODS: Systematic searches will be conducted in OVID Medline and Embase, using terms related to 'artificial intelligence', 'surgery' and 'video' to identify all potentially relevant studies published since 1st January 2012. All primary studies where AI has been applied to the analysis of videos (recorded by conventional digital cameras or laparoscopic or robotic-assisted technology) of general surgical procedures will be included. Data extraction will include study characteristics, governance, details of video datasets and AI models, measures of accuracy, validation and any reported limitations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required as primary data will not be collected. The results will be disseminated at relevant conferences, on social media and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the correlation between specific indicators and the quality of hip joint ultrasound images in infants and determine whether the individual infant suit ultrasound examination for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). METHOD: We retrospectively selected infants aged 0-6 months, undergone ultrasound imaging of the left hip joint between September 2021 and March 2022 at Shenzhen Children's Hospital. Using the entropy weighting method, weights were assigned to anatomical structures. Moreover, prospective data was collected from infants aged 5-11 months. The left hip joint was imaged, scored and weighted as before. The correlation between the weighted image quality scores and individual indicators were studied, with the last weighted image quality score used as the dependent variable and the individual indicators used as independent variables. A Long-short term memory (LSTM) model was used to fit the data and evaluate its effectiveness. Finally, The randomly selected images were manually measured and compared to measurements made using artificial intelligence (AI). RESULTS: According to the entropy weight method, the weights of each anatomical structure as follows: bony rim point 0.29, lower iliac limb point 0.41, and glenoid labrum 0.30. The final weighted score for ultrasound image quality is calculated by multiplying each score by its respective weight. Infant gender, age, height, and weight were found to be significantly correlated with the final weighted score of image quality (P < 0.05). The LSTM fitting model had a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.95. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for the alpha and beta angles between manual measurement and AI measurement was 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSION: The quality of ultrasound images for infants can be influenced by the individual indicators (gender, age, height, and weight). The LSTM model showed good fitting efficiency and can help clinicians select whether the individual infant suit ultrasound examination of DDH.

Title: Artificial intelligence-based analysis of time-lapse images of sphere formation and process of plate adhesion and spread of pancreatic cancer cells.
Author: ['Shichi Y', 'Gomi F', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Nonaka K', 'Shinji S', 'Takahashi K', 'Ishiwata T']
Journal Title: Frontiers in cell and developmental biology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Background: Most pancreatic cancers are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Spherical morphology formed in three-dimensional (3D) cultures and the effects of anticancer drugs differ between epithelial and mesenchymal PDAC cell lines. In the human pancreas, cancer cells form 3D tumors, migrate to adjacent tissues, and metastasize to other organs. However, no effective methods exist to examine the ability of the tumor mass to migrate to surrounding tissues in vitro. We used spheres formed in 3D culture to investigate whether the migratory ability of tumors of PDAC cell lines, including epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines, varies. Methods: Sphere formation and adhesion and spread on culture plates were examined by artificial intelligence-based analysis of time-lapse imaging using five epithelial and three mesenchymal PDAC cell lines. Fused and non-fused areas of the sphere surface during sphere formation on low-attachment plates, the adhesion area to normal culture plates, and the sphere area maintaining its original form during adhesion to plates were measured. Results: Immunocytochemical staining confirmed that E-cadherin was highly expressed in epithelial PDAC spheres, as was vimentin in mesenchymal PDAC spheres, in 2D culture. When forming spheres using low-attachment plates, most epithelial PDAC cell lines initially showed decreased sphere area, and then the covering cells fused to form a smooth surface on the sphere. Mesenchymal PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells showed little reduction in sphere area and few areas of sphere surface fusion. When formed PDAC spheres were seeded onto normal culture plates, spheres of epithelial PK-8 cells-which have the highest E-cadherin expression, form numerous cysts, and have smooth sphere surfaces-did not adhere to normal plates even after 60 h, and epithelial PK45-P and T3M-4 spheres hardly adhered. Conversely, the area of adhesion and spread of mesenchymal PANC-1 and KP4 cell spheres on normal plates markedly increased from early on, forming large areas of attachment to plates. Conclusion: Seeding spheres formed in 3D culture onto culture plates can clarify differences in tumor migration potential to surrounding areas. The masses formed by each PDAC cell line varied in migratory ability, with mesenchymal PDAC masses being more migratory than epithelial PDAC masses.

Journal Title: Occupational therapy international
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Occupational therapy (OT) educational programs are aimed at enrolling a diverse student population that is likely to succeed in the academic and fieldwork components of the program. Comprehending the array of factors that influence students' learning and academic and fieldwork success is important for university educators. This study investigated the existing literature on predictors of academic and fieldwork performance in OT students. METHODS: The search process used in this review included screening, eligibility, and study quality. We searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for literature published in the past 10 years (1 January 2012 to 30 March 2022). As a comprehensive search, the following keywords were used for abstract, title, and keywords sections: occupational therapy student, predictors, fieldwork, academic, academic success, academic performance, fieldwork success, and fieldwork performance. The Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument was used to assess the quality of studies. RESULTS: The systematic review retrieved 14 articles that met inclusion criteria. Most were cross-sectional studies, followed by cohort, retrospective analysis of secondary data, and exploratory studies. Four articles focused on academic success, eight focused on fieldwork success, and two explored both aspects. Promising predictors of academic performance included the admission grade point average and the student's approach to studying. Predictors of fieldwork performance included a graduate record examination score, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal relationships. CONCLUSION: This systematic review explores predictors of academic and fieldwork success in OT students, which provide opportunities to identify early the learning difficulties of students and assist educators to target modifiable predictors so they can provide high-quality education.

Title: Framework for Classifying Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Algorithms in Clinical Medicine.
Author: ['Gniadek T', 'Kang J', 'Theparee T', 'Krive J']
Journal Title: Online journal of public health informatics
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to medicine offers immense promise, in addition to safety and regulatory concerns. Traditional AI produces a core algorithm result, typically without a measure of statistical confidence or an explanation of its biological-theoretical basis. Efforts are underway to develop explainable AI (XAI) algorithms that not only produce a result but also an explanation to support that result. Here we present a framework for classifying XAI algorithms applied to clinical medicine: An algorithm's clinical scope is defined by whether the core algorithm output leads to observations (eg, tests, imaging, clinical evaluation), interventions (eg, procedures, medications), diagnoses, and prognostication. Explanations are classified by whether they provide empiric statistical information, association with a historical population or populations, or association with an established disease mechanism or mechanisms. XAI implementations can be classified based on whether algorithm training and validation took into account the actions of health care providers in response to the insights and explanations provided or whether training was performed using only the core algorithm output as the end point. Finally, communication modalities used to convey an XAI explanation can be used to classify algorithms and may affect clinical outcomes. This framework can be used when designing, evaluating, and comparing XAI algorithms applied to medicine.

Journal Title: International journal of telerehabilitation
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: SCOPE: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, community rehabilitation stakeholders from a provincial health system designed a novel telerehabilitation service. The service provided wayfinding and self-management advice to individuals with musculoskeletal concerns, neurological conditions, or post-COVID-19 recovery needs. This study evaluated the efficiency of the service in improving access to care. METHODOLOGY: We used multiple methods including secondary data analyses of call metrics, narrative analyses of clinical notes using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and qualitative interviews. CONCLUSIONS: Interviews revealed that the telerehabilitation service had the potential to positively impact access to rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, for individuals living rurally, and for individuals on wait lists. Call metric analyses revealed that efficiency may be enhanced if call handling time was reduced. AI/ML analyses found that pain was the most frequently-mentioned keyword in clinical notes, suggesting an area for additional telerehabilitation resources to ensure efficiency.

Title: Machine Learning Applications in Spine Surgery.
Author: ['Tragaris T', 'Benetos IS', 'Vlamis J', 'Pneumaticos S']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Oct
Abstract: This literature review sought to identify and evaluate the current applications of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) in spine surgery that can effectively guide clinical decision-making and surgical planning. By using specific keywords to maximize search sensitivity, a thorough literature research was conducted in several online databases: Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar, and the findings were filtered according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 46 studies met the requirements and were included in this review. According to this study, AI/ML models were sufficiently accurate with a mean overall value of 74.9%, and performed best at preoperative patient selection, cost prediction, and length of stay. Performance was also good at predicting functional outcomes and postoperative mortality. Regression analysis was the most frequently utilized application whereas deep learning/artificial neural networks had the highest sensitivity score (81.5%). Despite the relatively brief history of engagement with AI/ML, as evidenced by the fact that 77.5% of studies were published after 2018, the outcomes have been promising. In light of the Big Data era, the increasing prevalence of National Registries, and the wide-ranging applications of AI, such as exemplified by ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, California), it is highly likely that the field of spine surgery will gradually adopt and integrate AI/ML into its clinical practices. Consequently, it is of great significance for spine surgeons to acquaint themselves with the fundamental principles of AI/ML, as these technologies hold the potential for substantial improvements in overall patient care.
