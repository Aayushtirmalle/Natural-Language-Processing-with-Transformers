Author: ['Arce D', 'Solano J', 'Beltran C']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: At the beginning of a project or research that involves the issue of autonomous navigation of mobile robots, a decision must be made about working with traditional control algorithms or algorithms based on artificial intelligence. This decision is not usually easy, as the computational capacity of the robot, the availability of information through its sensory systems and the characteristics of the environment must be taken into consideration. For this reason, this work focuses on a review of different autonomous-navigation algorithms applied to mobile robots, from which the most suitable ones have been identified for the cases in which the robot must navigate in dynamic environments. Based on the identified algorithms, a comparison of these traditional and DRL-based algorithms was made, using a robotic platform to evaluate their performance, identify their advantages and disadvantages and provide a recommendation for their use, according to the development requirements of the robot. The algorithms selected were DWA, TEB, CADRL and SAC, and the results show that-according to the application and the robot's characteristics-it is recommended to use each of them, based on different conditions.

Title: Maximum Acceptable Tilt Angle for Point Autofocus Microscopy.
Author: ['Song H', 'Li Q', 'Shi Z']
Journal Title: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: The complete and accurate acquisition of geometric information forms the bedrock of maintaining high-end instrument performance and monitoring product quality. It is also a prerequisite for achieving the 'precision' and 'intelligence' that the manufacturing industry aspires to achieve. Industrial microscopes, known for their high accuracy and resolution, have become invaluable tools in the precision measurement of small components. However, these industrial microscopes often struggle to demonstrate their advantages when dealing with complex shapes or large tilt angles. This paper introduces a ray-tracing model for point autofocus microscopy, and it provides the quantified relationship formula between the maximum acceptable tilt angle and the beam offset accepted in point autofocus microscopy, then analyzing the maximum acceptable tilt angle of the objects being measured. This novel approach uses the geometric features of a high-precision reference sphere to simulate the tilt angle and displacement of the surface under investigation. The research findings show that the maximum acceptable tilt angles of a point autofocus microscope vary across different measured directions. Additionally, the extent to which the maximum acceptable tilt angles are affected by the distances of the beam offset also varies. Finally, the difference between the experiment results and the theoretical results is less than 0.5 degrees .

Title: Oncolytic Viruses in the Era of Omics, Computational Technologies, and Modeling: Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis.
Author: ['Menotti L', 'Vannini A']
Journal Title: International journal of molecular sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are the frontier therapy for refractory cancers, especially in integration with immunomodulation strategies. In cancer immunovirotherapy, the many available "omics" and systems biology technologies generate at a fast pace a challenging huge amount of data, where apparently clashing information mirrors the complexity of individual clinical situations and OV used. In this review, we present and discuss how currently big data analysis, on one hand and, on the other, simulation, modeling, and computational technologies, provide invaluable support to interpret and integrate "omic" information and drive novel synthetic biology and personalized OV engineering approaches for effective immunovirotherapy. Altogether, these tools, possibly aided in the future by artificial intelligence as well, will allow for the blending of the information into OV recombinants able to achieve tumor clearance in a patient-tailored way. Various endeavors to the envisioned "synthesis" of turning OVs into personalized theranostic agents are presented.

Author: ['Fabijan A', 'Polis B', 'Fabijan R', 'Zakrzewski K', 'Nowoslawska E', 'Zawadzka-Fabijan A']
Journal Title: Journal of personalized medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: Open-source artificial intelligence models are finding free application in various industries, including computer science and medicine. Their clinical potential, especially in assisting diagnosis and therapy, is the subject of increasingly intensive research. Due to the growing interest in AI for diagnostics, we conducted a study evaluating the abilities of AI models, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Scholar AI, in classifying single-curve scoliosis based on radiological descriptions. Fifty-six posturographic images depicting single-curve scoliosis were selected and assessed by two independent neurosurgery specialists, who classified them as mild, moderate, or severe based on Cobb angles. Subsequently, descriptions were developed that accurately characterized the degree of spinal deformation, based on the measured values of Cobb angles. These descriptions were then provided to AI language models to assess their proficiency in diagnosing spinal pathologies. The artificial intelligence models conducted classification using the provided data. Our study also focused on identifying specific sources of information and criteria applied in their decision-making algorithms, aiming for a deeper understanding of the determinants influencing AI decision processes in scoliosis classification. The classification quality of the predictions was evaluated using performance evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and balanced accuracy. Our study strongly supported our hypothesis, showing that among four AI models, ChatGPT 4 and Scholar AI Premium excelled in classifying single-curve scoliosis with perfect sensitivity and specificity. These models demonstrated unmatched rater concordance and excellent performance metrics. In comparing real and AI-generated scoliosis classifications, they showed impeccable precision in all posturographic images, indicating total accuracy (1.0, MAE = 0.0) and remarkable inter-rater agreement, with a perfect Fleiss' Kappa score. This was consistent across scoliosis cases with a Cobb's angle range of 11-92 degrees. Despite high accuracy in classification, each model used an incorrect angular range for the mild stage of scoliosis. Our findings highlight the immense potential of AI in analyzing medical data sets. However, the diversity in competencies of AI models indicates the need for their further development to more effectively meet specific needs in clinical practice.

Journal Title: Journal of personalized medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) using artificial intelligence. To do so, we compared the real-life situation during the pandemic with the pre-2020 situation. METHODS: This non-interventional, retrospective, observational study applied natural language processing to the electronic health records of the Castilla-La Mancha region of Spain. The analysis was conducted from January 2015 to December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2592 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis; 64.6% were males, and the mean age was 53.5 years (95%CI 53.0-54.0). In 2020, pulmonary tuberculosis diagnoses dropped by 28% compared to 2019. In total, 62 (14.2%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and pulmonary tuberculosis coinfection in 2020, with a mean age of 52.3 years (95%CI 48.3-56.2). The main symptoms in these patients were dyspnea (27.4%) and cough (35.5%), although their comorbidities were no greater than patients with isolated TB. The female sex was more frequently affected, representing 53.4% of this patient subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease was observed in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Women presented a significantly higher risk for pulmonary tuberculosis and COVID-19 coinfection, although the symptoms were not more severe than patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis alone.

Title: Review and Assessment of Fatigue Delamination Damage of Laminated Composite Structures.
Author: ['Deng J', 'Zhou J', 'Wu T', 'Liu Z', 'Wu Z']
Journal Title: Materials (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 16
Abstract: Fatigue delamination damage is one of the most important fatigue failure modes for laminated composite structures. However, there are still many challenging problems in the development of the theoretical framework, mathematical/physical models, and numerical simulation of fatigue delamination. What is more, it is essential to establish a systematic classification of these methods and models. This article reviews the experimental phenomena of delamination onset and propagation under fatigue loading. The authors reviewed the commonly used phenomenological models for laminated composite structures. The research methods, general modeling formulas, and development prospects of phenomenological models were presented in detail. Based on the analysis of finite element models (FEMs) for laminated composite structures, several simulation methods for fatigue delamination damage models (FDDMs) were carefully classified. Then, the whole procedure, range of applications, capability assessment, and advantages and limitations of the models, which were based on four types of theoretical frameworks, were also discussed in detail. The theoretical frameworks include the strength theory model (SM), fracture mechanics model (FM), damage mechanics model (DM), and hybrid model (HM). To the best of the authors' knowledge, the FDDM based on the modified Paris law within the framework of hybrid fracture and damage mechanics is the most effective method so far. However, it is difficult for the traditional FDDM to solve the problem of the spatial delamination of complex structures. In addition, the balance between the cost of acquiring the model and the computational efficiency of the model is also critical. Therefore, several potential research directions, such as the extended finite element method (XFEM), isogeometric analysis (IGA), phase-field model (PFM), artificial intelligence algorithm, and higher-order deformation theory (HODT), have been presented in the conclusions. Through validation by investigators, these research directions have the ability to overcome the challenging technical issues in the fatigue delamination prediction of laminated composite structures.

Title: Mechanochemical Degradation of Biopolymers.
Author: ['Jicsinszky L', 'Bucciol F', 'Chaji S', 'Cravotto G']
Journal Title: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 10
Abstract: Mechanochemical treatment of various organic molecules is an emerging technology of green processes in biofuel, fine chemicals, or food production. Many biopolymers are involved in isolating, derivating, or modifying molecules of natural origin. Mechanochemistry provides a powerful tool to achieve these goals, but the unintentional modification of biopolymers by mechanochemical manipulation is not always obvious or even detectable. Although modeling molecular changes caused by mechanical stresses in cavitation and grinding processes is feasible in small model compounds, simulation of extrusion processes primarily relies on phenomenological approaches that allow only tool- and material-specific conclusions. The development of analytical and computational techniques allows for the inline and real-time control of parameters in various mechanochemical processes. Using artificial intelligence to analyze process parameters and product characteristics can significantly improve production optimization. We aim to review the processes and consequences of possible chemical, physicochemical, and structural changes.

Abstract: Apples are rich in vitamins and dietary fiber and are one of the essential fruits in people's daily diet. China has always been a big apple consumer, and with the improvement of people's life quality, nutrition, and health requirements, the demand for high-quality apples has increased year by year. Apple mold heart disease is one of the main diseases affecting apple quality. However, this disease cannot be easily detected from the surface, so it is difficult to detect mold heart disease. Therefore, this paper focuses on the analysis of seven non-destructive detection technologies, including near infrared spectroscopy technology, hyperspectral technology, Raman spectroscopy technology, electronic nose technology, acoustic technology, electrical technology, and magnetic technology, summarizes their application status in the detection of apple mold heart disease, and then analyzes their advantages and disadvantages. Combined with the current rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, this paper proposes the future development trends of using non-destructive technologies to detect apple mold heart disease. It is expected to provide basic theory and application references for the intelligent detection of apple mold heart disease.

Title: Investigation of a Circularly Polarized Metasurface Antenna for Hybrid Wireless Applications.
Author: ['Behera BR', 'Alsharif MH', 'Jahid A']
Journal Title: Micromachines
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 29
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the primary networking infrastructure in a future society, driven by a strong focus on sustainability and data, is noteworthy. A significant concern associated with the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is the insufficient availability of viable strategies for effectively sustaining their power supply and ensuring their uninterrupted functionality. The ability of RF energy-harvesting systems to externally replenish batteries serves as a primary driver for the development of these technologies. To effectively mitigate concerns related to wireless technology, it is imperative to adhere strictly to the mandated limitations on electromagnetic field emissions. A TA broadband polarization-reconfigurable Y-shaped monopole antenna that is improved with a SADEA-tuned smart metasurface is one technique that has been proposed in order to accomplish this goal. A Y-shaped printed monopole antenna is first taken into consideration. To comprehend the process of polarization reconfigurability transitioning from linear to circular polarization (CP), a BAR 50-02 V RF PIN Diode is employed to shorten one of the parasitic conducting strips to the ground plane. A SADEA-driven metasurface, which utilizes the artificial intelligence-driven surrogate model-assisted differential evolution for antenna synthesis, is devised and positioned beneath the radiator to optimize performance trade-offs while increasing the antenna's gain and bandwidth. The ultimate prototype achieves the following: an impedance bandwidth of 2.58 GHz (3.27-5.85 GHz, 48.45%); an axial bandwidth of 1.25 GHz (4.19-5.44 GHz, 25.96%); a peak gain exceeding 8.45 dBic; and when a highly efficient rectifier is integrated, the maximum RF-DC conversion efficiency of 73.82% and DC output of 5.44 V are obtained. Based on the results mentioned earlier, it is considered appropriate to supply power to intelligent sensors and reduce reliance on batteries via RF energy-harvesting mechanisms implemented in hybrid wireless applications.

Title: Point-of-Care Ultrasound-History, Current and Evolving Clinical Concepts in Emergency Medicine.
Author: ['Osterwalder J', 'Polyzogopoulou E', 'Hoffmann B']
Journal Title: Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has become an indispensable standard in emergency medicine. Emergency medicine ultrasound (EMUS) is the application of bedside PoCUS by the attending emergency physician to assist in the diagnosis and management of many time-sensitive health emergencies. In many ways, using PoCUS is not only the mere application of technology, but also a fusion of already existing examiner skills and technology in the context of a patient encounter. EMUS practice can be defined using distinct anatomy-based applications. The type of applications and their complexity usually depend on local needs and resources, and practice patterns can vary significantly among regions, countries, or even continents. A different approach suggests defining EMUS in categories such as resuscitative, diagnostic, procedural guidance, symptom- or sign-based, and therapeutic. Because EMUS is practiced in a constantly evolving emergency medical setting where no two patient encounters are identical, the concept of EMUS should also be practiced in a fluid, constantly adapting manner driven by the physician treating the patient. Many recent advances in ultrasound technology have received little or no attention from the EMUS community, and several important technical advances and research findings have not been translated into routine clinical practice. The authors believe that four main areas have great potential for the future growth and development of EMUS and are worth integrating: 1. In recent years, many articles have been published on novel ultrasound applications. Only a small percentage has found its way into routine use. We will discuss two important examples: trauma ultrasound that goes beyond e-FAST and EMUS lung ultrasound for suspected pulmonary embolism. 2. The more ultrasound equipment becomes financially affordable; the more ultrasound should be incorporated into the physical examination. This merging and possibly even replacement of aspects of the classical physical exam by technology will likely outperform the isolated use of stethoscope, percussion, and auscultation. 3. The knowledge of pathophysiological processes in acute illness and ultrasound findings should be merged in clinical practice. The translation of this knowledge into practical concepts will allow us to better manage many presentations, such as hypotension or the dyspnea of unclear etiology. 4. Technical innovations such as elastography; CEUS; highly sensitive color Doppler such as M-flow, vector flow, or other novel technology; artificial intelligence; cloud-based POCUS functions; and augmented reality devices such as smart glasses should become standard in emergencies over time.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: In the realm of the rising incidence of cutaneous and mucous melanoma, CDKN2A mutations characterize familial and multiple primary melanoma cases. The involvement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is interconnected with survival rates, but may extend even further. The aim of this study is to verify the accuracy of the classical "naked eye" count of CD8-positive T cells comprised within the tumoral population and peritumoral infiltrate versus that obtained via a special software run by the aid of artificial intelligence (AI), used to determine the percentage of CD8-positive TILs. Materials and Methods: The present retrospective cross-sectional study conducted over a period of 5 years (2018-2022) focused on patients diagnosed with mucous and/or cutaneous melanoma, with a positive family history for melanoma, or personal antecedents of primary malignant melanocytic lesions. The 23 selected cases were diagnosed histopathologically, tested for CDKN2A mutations through fluorescent hybridization in situ, and CD8 immunohistochemistry was performed. The included slides were evaluated both manually (naked-eye examination) and automatically (via QuPath platform) for quantifying the CD8-positive TILs. Results: The number of CD8-positive TILs in melanoma samples has been more accurately identified through the use of an AI-mediated software as compared to the human-eye evaluation performed by experimental pathologists. A higher percentage of CD8-positive intratumoral lymphocytes versus stromal lymphocytes was positively associated with more numerous metastatic sites. Conclusions: The CD8 lymphocytic phenotype harbors major significance in the context of familial and multiple primary melanoma and may comprise a cost-effective investigation meant to help in the establishment of melanoma prognosis and response to immunotherapy.

Title: Prevalence of and Gender Differences in Psychiatric Disorders among Juvenile Detainees in South Korea: A Comparative Study.
Author: ['Choi BS', 'Kim B']
Journal Title: Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 23
Abstract: Background and Objectives: High rates of psychiatric disorders and comorbidities have been reported in juvenile detainees, which have been associated with repeat offenses. However, research into this topic has been limited to Asian countries. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and sexual differences among juvenile detainees in a detention center in South Korea. Materials and Methods: The participants comprised 54 males and 46 females, with a minimum intelligence score of 80. Psychiatric diagnosis was determined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID). The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2 (MAYSI-2) was used to investigate gender differences. Results: Using the MINI-KID, the most frequent diseases were conduct disorder (CD), alcohol dependence, suicidal tendency, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with statistically significant differences between men and women. Only alcohol abuse was higher in males, while the rest were higher in females. The items with a statistically significant gender difference in MAYSI-2 were alcohol/drug use, feeling depressed/anxious, somatic complaints, suicidal ideation, and traumatic experiences. All items for which gender difference was statistically significant were higher in the proportion of women. Conclusions: Juvenile detainees exhibit high rates of psychiatric disorders and comorbidities. CDs, alcohol dependence, and ADHD are the most common psychiatric disorders among juvenile detainees in South Korea. Assessment of and intervention in psychiatric disorders may help prevent further offenses. These findings highlight the importance of diagnosing and intervening in psychiatric disorders within juvenile detention systems.

Title: Assessing Non-Specific Neck Pain through Pose Estimation from Images Based on Ensemble Learning.
Author: ['Kang JH', 'Hsieh EH', 'Lee CY', 'Sun YM', 'Lee TY', 'Hsu JB', 'Chang TH']
Journal Title: Life (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mobile phones, laptops, and computers have become an indispensable part of our lives in recent years. Workers may have an incorrect posture when using a computer for a prolonged period of time. Using these products with an incorrect posture can lead to neck pain. However, there are limited data on postures in real-life situations. METHODS: In this study, we used a common camera to record images of subjects carrying out three different tasks (a typing task, a gaming task, and a video-watching task) on a computer. Different artificial intelligence (AI)-based pose estimation approaches were applied to analyze the head's yaw, pitch, and roll and coordinate information of the eyes, nose, neck, and shoulders in the images. We used machine learning models such as random forest, XGBoost, logistic regression, and ensemble learning to build a model to predict whether a subject had neck pain by analyzing their posture when using the computer. RESULTS: After feature selection and adjustment of the predictive models, nested cross-validation was applied to evaluate the models and fine-tune the hyperparameters. Finally, the ensemble learning approach was utilized to construct a model via bagging, which achieved a performance with 87% accuracy, 92% precision, 80.3% recall, 95.5% specificity, and an AUROC of 0.878. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a predictive model for the identification of non-specific neck pain using 2D video images without the need for costly devices, advanced environment settings, or extra sensors. This method could provide an effective way for clinically evaluating poor posture during real-world computer usage scenarios.

Title: Exercise Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease: Unraveling Neurobiological Mechanisms and Assessing Effects.
Author: ['Ren J', 'Xiao H']
Journal Title: Life (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and a major cause of age-related dementia, characterized by cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment. The underlying causes include the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in the brain, abnormal phosphorylation, and aggregation of tau protein within nerve cells, as well as neuronal damage and death. Currently, there is no cure for AD with drug therapy. Non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise have been widely used to treat AD, but the specific molecular and biological mechanisms are not well understood. In this narrative review, we integrate the biology of AD and summarize the knowledge of the molecular, neural, and physiological mechanisms underlying exercise-induced improvements in AD progression. We discuss various exercise interventions used in AD and show that exercise directly or indirectly affects the brain by regulating crosstalk mechanisms between peripheral organs and the brain, including "bone-brain crosstalk", "muscle-brain crosstalk", and "gut-brain crosstalk". We also summarize the potential role of artificial intelligence and neuroimaging technologies in exercise interventions for AD. We emphasize that moderate-intensity, regular, long-term exercise may improve the progression of Alzheimer's disease through various molecular and biological pathways, with multimodal exercise providing greater benefits. Through in-depth exploration of the molecular and biological mechanisms and effects of exercise interventions in improving AD progression, this review aims to contribute to the existing knowledge base and provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for managing AD.

Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) are often not reported by radiologists on routine chest radiographs. This study aims to investigate the clinical value of a newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Ofeye 1.0, for automated detection of OVFs on lateral chest radiographs in post-menopausal women (>60 years) who were referred to undergo chest x-rays for other reasons. A total of 510 de-identified lateral chest radiographs from three clinical sites were retrieved and analysed using the Ofeye 1.0 tool. These images were then reviewed by a consultant radiologist with findings serving as the reference standard for determining the diagnostic performance of the AI tool for the detection of OVFs. Of all the original radiologist reports, missed OVFs were found in 28.8% of images but were detected using the AI tool. The AI tool demonstrated high specificity of 92.8% (95% CI: 89.6, 95.2%), moderate accuracy of 80.3% (95% CI: 76.3, 80.4%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 73.7% (95% CI: 65.2, 80.8%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.5% (95% CI: 79, 83.8%), but low sensitivity of 49% (95% CI: 40.7, 57.3%). The AI tool showed improved sensitivity compared with the original radiologist reports, which was 20.8% (95% CI: 14.5, 28.4). The new AI tool can be used as a complementary tool in routine diagnostic reports for the reduction in missed OVFs in elderly women.
