Author: ['Lockie E', 'Choi J']
Journal Title: ANZ journal of surgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in all aspects of life in information compilation and writing, and this includes healthcare. This study aimed to evaluate a Chat GPT generated patient information leaflet (PIL) against a surgeon generated version, in order to explore a potential application of this artificial intelligence language processing model. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, undertaken May to June 2023, asking two cohorts (patients and doctors) to complete a questionnaire evaluating a Chat GPT generated PIL and a surgeon generated PIL about laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were having laparoscopic cholecystectomy at large private Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, and doctors were recruited from this hospital and a public quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The study included a convenience sample of 28 patients and 16 doctors. The main outcome measure was a questionnaire (maximum score out of 8) based on validated evaluation instrument for PILs. RESULTS: The study recruited 28 patients and 15 doctors to complete the questionnaire. The Chat GPT and surgeon generated PILs were scored similarly by patients (median 8 for both PIL; mean 7.5 for Chat GPT PIL vs. 7.1 for surgeon PIL). Doctors also scored both versions similarly, with slightly higher scores for Chat GPT over surgeon version (median 7 vs. 6; mean 6.7 vs. 5.6, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Chat GPT generated PIL was assessed as being as good or slightly better than the surgeon generated version. This study shows that PIL are a feasible application of AI language processing models.

Title: Machine learning in predicting gastric cancer survival Presenting a novel decision support system model.
Author: ['Altinsoy E', 'Bakirarar B', 'Culcu S']
Journal Title: Annali italiani di chirurgia
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is the 4th most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 40%. In recent years, many artificial intelligence applications have been used in the field of gastric cancer through their effective computing and learning ability. In this study, we aim to develop a software that can accurately detect overall survival in gastric cancer cases with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. METHODS: The study included 34417 patients' data diagnosed with gastric cancer between 2010 and 2015. The main hypothesis in the study was overall survival (OS) in years, defined from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or, for living patients, the last control date. In addition to survival, other variables selected for the analyzes were age at diagnosis, race, gender, behavior, primary site, grade, histology, T stage, N stage, M stage and size of the tumor, vital status, and follow-up time (months). RESULTS: The median overall survival of the patients was found to be 15.00+/-0.20 years. Median life expectancy was found to be 21.00+/-0.85 years for those younger than 50 years of age, 20.00+/-0.43 years for those aged 50-69 years, and 10.00+/-0.22 years for those aged 70 and over. Especially artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and deep learning lead to remarkable developments in the field of gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: With the ability to compute and learn we think that use of artificial intelligence will be revolutionary in gastric cancer in terms of diagnosis and prognosis. KEY WORDS: Artificial intelligence, Gastric cancer, Survival.

Journal Title: Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: Ganirelix, a peptide-based drug used to treat female infertility, has been in high market demand, which attracted generic formulation. A hitherto unknown impurity of ganirelix was observed in our formulation process, which reached ~0.3% in 6 months and led to a detailed investigation of its structure. In-depth analysis of ESI-MS/MS data of this impurity coupled with an artificial intelligence prediction tool led to a highly unusual putative structure, that is, N-(2-carboxyethyl)-ganirelix ((N) CE-GA), which was authenticated by chemical synthesis from ganirelix and NMR analysis and via corroborated HPLC and MS/MS data with the formulation-derived impurity.

Title: COVID's long shadow: How SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, and vaccination status affect long-term cognitive performance and health.
Author: ['Flegr J', 'Latifi A']
Journal Title: Biology methods & protocols
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: COVID-19 affects a variety of organs and systems of the body including the central nervous system. Recent research has shown that COVID-19 survivors often experience neurological and psychiatric complications that can last for months after infection. We conducted a large Internet study using online tests to analyze the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, and vaccination on health, intelligence, memory, and information processing precision and speed in a cohort of 4445 subjects. We found that both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity were associated with negative impacts on patients' health. Furthermore, we observed a negative association between COVID-19 severity and cognitive performance. Younger participants had a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 contraction, while the elderly had a higher likelihood of severe COVID-19 and vaccination. The association between age and COVID-19 severity was primarily mediated by older participants' impaired long-term health. Vaccination was positively associated with intelligence and the precision of information processing. However, the positive association between vaccination and intelligence was likely mediated by achieved education, which was itself strongly associated with the likelihood of being vaccinated.

Journal Title: World journal of clinical cases
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 6
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted many areas of healthcare. AI in healthcare uses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to analyze copious amounts of healthcare data and yield valuable outcomes. In the sleep medicine field, a large amount of physiological data is gathered compared to other branches of medicine. This field is primed for innovations with the help of AI. A good quality of sleep is crucial for optimal health. About one billion people are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnea worldwide, but it is difficult to diagnose and treat all the people with limited resources. Sleep apnea is one of the major contributors to poor health. Most of the sleep apnea patients remain undiagnosed. Those diagnosed with sleep apnea have difficulty getting it optimally treated due to several factors, and AI can help in this situation. AI can also help in the diagnosis and management of other sleep disorders such as insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorders, periodic leg movement disorders, etc. In this manuscript, we aim to address three critical issues about the use of AI in sleep medicine: (1) How can AI help in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders? (2) How can AI fill the gap in the care of sleep disorders? and (3) What are the ethical and legal considerations of using AI in sleep medicine?

Title: A Study on Distinguishing ChatGPT-Generated and Human-Written Orthopaedic Abstracts by Reviewers: Decoding the Discrepancies.
Author: ['Makiev KG', 'Asimakidou M', 'Vasios IS', 'Keskinis A', 'Petkidis G', 'Tilkeridis K', 'Ververidis A', 'Iliopoulos E']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: BACKGROUND: ChatGPT (OpenAI Incorporated, Mission District, San Francisco, United States) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based language model that generates human-resembling texts. This AI-generated literary work is comprehensible and contextually relevant and it is really difficult to differentiate from human-written content. ChatGPT has risen in popularity lately and is widely utilized in scholarly manuscript drafting. The aim of this study is to identify if 1) human reviewers can differentiate between AI-generated and human-written abstracts and 2) AI detectors are currently reliable in detecting AI-generated abstracts. METHODS: Seven blinded reviewers were asked to read 21 abstracts and differentiate which were AI-generated and which were human-written. The first group consisted of three orthopaedic residents with limited research experience (OR). The second group included three orthopaedic professors with extensive research experience (OP). The seventh reviewer was a non-orthopaedic doctor and acted as a control in terms of expertise. All abstracts were scanned by a plagiarism detector program. The performance of detecting AI-generated abstracts of two different AI detectors was also analyzed. A structured interview was conducted at the end of the survey in order to evaluate the decision-making process utilized by each reviewer. RESULTS: The OR group managed to identify correctly 34.9% of the abstracts' authorship and the OP group 31.7%. The non-orthopaedic control identified correctly 76.2%. All AI-generated abstracts were 100% unique (0% plagiarism). The first AI detector managed to identify correctly only 9/21 (42.9%) of the abstracts' authors, whereas the second AI detector identified 14/21 (66.6%). CONCLUSION: Inability to correctly identify AI-generated context poses a significant scientific risk as "false" abstracts can end up in scientific conferences or publications. Neither expertise nor research background was shown to have any meaningful impact on the predictive outcome. Focus on statistical data presentation may help the differentiation process. Further research is warranted in order to highlight which elements could help reveal an AI-generated abstract.

Author: ['Asokan A', 'Massey CJ', 'Tietbohl C', 'Kroenke K', 'Morris M', 'Ramakrishnan VR']
Journal Title: Laryngoscope investigative otolaryngology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate otolaryngologists' knowledge, trust, acceptance, and concerns with clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). METHODS: This study used mixed methods with survey and semistructured interviews. Survey was e-mailed to American Rhinologic Society members, of which a volunteer sample of 86 members responded. Nineteen otolaryngologists were purposefully recruited and interviewed until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents (10% response rate) completed the majority of the survey: 49% worked in academic settings and 43% completed residency 10 or fewer years ago. Of 19 interviewees, 58% worked in academic settings, and 47% completed residency 10 or fewer years ago. Familiarity: Only 8% of survey respondents reported having AI training in residency, although 72% had familiarity with general AI concepts; 0 interviewees had personal experience with AI in clinical settings. Expected uses: Of the surveyed otolaryngologists, 82% would use an AI-based clinical decision aid and 74% were comfortable with AI proposing treatment recommendations. However, only 44% of participants would trust AI to identify malignancy and 53% to interpret radiographic images. Interviewees trusted AI for simple tasks, such as labeling septal deviation, more than complex ones, such as identifying tumors. Factors influencing AI adoption: 89% of survey participants would use AI if it improved patient satisfaction, 78% would be willing to use AI if experts and studies validated the technologies, and 73% would only use AI if it increased efficiency. Sixty-one percent of survey respondents expected AI incorporation into clinical practice within 5 years. Interviewees emphasized that AI adoption depends on its similarity to their clinical judgment and to expert opinion. Concerns included nuanced or complex cases, poor design or accuracy, and the personal nature of physician-patient relationships. CONCLUSION: Few physicians have experience with AI technologies but expect rapid adoption in the clinic, highlighting the urgent need for clinical education and research. Otolaryngologists are most receptive to AI "augmenting" physician expertise and administrative capacity, with respect for physician autonomy and maintaining relationships with patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level VI, descriptive or qualitative study.

Title: Advances in machine intelligence-driven virtual screening approaches for big-data.
Author: ['Kumar N', 'Acharya V']
Journal Title: Medicinal research reviews
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is an integral and ever-evolving domain of drug discovery framework. The VS is traditionally classified into ligand-based (LB) and structure-based (SB) approaches. Machine intelligence or artificial intelligence has wide applications in the drug discovery domain to reduce time and resource consumption. In combination with machine intelligence algorithms, VS has emerged into revolutionarily progressive technology that learns within robust decision orders for data curation and hit molecule screening from large VS libraries in minutes or hours. The exponential growth of chemical and biological data has evolved as "big-data" in the public domain demands modern and advanced machine intelligence-driven VS approaches to screen hit molecules from ultra-large VS libraries. VS has evolved from an individual approach (LB and SB) to integrated LB and SB techniques to explore various ligand and target protein aspects for the enhanced rate of appropriate hit molecule prediction. Current trends demand advanced and intelligent solutions to handle enormous data in drug discovery domain for screening and optimizing hits or lead with fewer or no false positive hits. Following the big-data drift and tremendous growth in computational architecture, we presented this review. Here, the article categorized and emphasized individual VS techniques, detailed literature presented for machine learning implementation, modern machine intelligence approaches, and limitations and deliberated the future prospects.

Journal Title: Journal of glaucoma
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: PURPOSE: To summarize the main topics discussed during the 28th Annual Glaucoma Foundation Think Tank Meeting "A Patient-Centric Approach to Glaucoma" held in New York on June 9th and 10th 2023. METHODS: The highlights of the sessions on BIG DATA, genetics, modifiable lifestyle risk factors, female sex hormones, and neuroprotection in the field of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were summarized. RESULTS: The researchers discussed the importance of BIG DATA repositories available at national and international levels for POAG research, including the United Kingdom Biobank. Combining genotyped large cohorts worldwide, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches, led to the milestone discovery of 312 genome-wide significant disease loci for POAG. While these loci could be combined into a polygenic risk score with clinical utility, Think Tank meeting participants also provided analytical epidemiological evidence that behavioral risk factors modify POAG polygenetic risk, citing specific examples related to caffeine and alcohol use. The impact of female sex hormones on POAG pathophysiology was discussed, as was neuroprotection and the potential use of AI to help mitigate specific challenges faced in clinical trials and speed approval of neuroprotective agents. CONCLUSION: The experts agreed on the importance of genetics in defining individual POAG risk and highlighted the additional crucial role of lifestyle, gender, blood pressure, and vascular risk factors. The main takeaways also included that BIG DATA repositories and AI are important combinatory tools to foster novel strategies to prevent and stabilize glaucoma and, in the future, recover vision loss from the disease.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer, a prevalent form of endocrine malignancy, has witnessed a substantial increase in occurrence in recent decades. To gain a comprehensive understanding of thyroid cancer at the single-cell level, this narrative review evaluates the applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in thyroid cancer research. ScRNA-seq has revolutionised the identification and characterisation of distinct cell subpopulations, cell-to-cell communications, and receptor interactions, revealing unprecedented heterogeneity and shedding light on novel biomarkers for therapeutic discovery. These findings aid in the construction of predictive models on disease prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. Altogether, scRNA-seq has deepened our understanding of the tumour microenvironment immunologic insights, informing future studies in the development of effective personalised treatment for patients. Challenges and limitations of scRNA-seq, such as technical biases, financial barriers, and ethical concerns, are discussed. Advancements in computational methods, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), and the importance of single-cell data sharing and collaborative efforts are highlighted. Future directions of scRNA-seq in thyroid cancer research include investigating intra-tumoral heterogeneity, integrating with other omics technologies, exploring the non-coding RNA landscape, and studying rare subtypes. Overall, scRNA-seq has transformed thyroid cancer research and holds immense potential for advancing personalised therapies and improving patient outcomes. Efforts to make this technology more accessible and cost-effective will be crucial to ensuring its widespread utilisation in healthcare.

Title: [The contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) subsequent to the processing of thoracic imaging].
Author: ['Grenier PA', 'Brun AL', 'Mellot F']
Journal Title: Revue des maladies respiratoires
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: The contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) to medical imaging is currently the object of widespread experimentation. The development of deep learning (DL) methods, particularly convolution neural networks (CNNs), has led to performance gains often superior to those achieved by conventional methods such as machine learning. Radiomics is an approach aimed at extracting quantitative data not accessible to the human eye from images expressing a disease. The data subsequently feed machine learning models and produce diagnostic or prognostic probabilities. As for the multiple applications of AI methods in thoracic imaging, they are undergoing evaluation. Chest radiography is a practically ideal field for the development of DL algorithms able to automatically interpret X-rays. Current algorithms can detect up to 14 different abnormalities present either in isolation or in combination. Chest CT is another area offering numerous AI applications. Various algorithms have been specifically formed and validated for the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules and pulmonary embolism, as well as segmentation and quantitative analysis of the extent of diffuse lung diseases (emphysema, infectious pneumonias, interstitial lung disease). In addition, the analysis of medical images can be associated with clinical, biological, and functional data (multi-omics analysis), the objective being to construct predictive approaches regarding disease prognosis and response to treatment.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality, reliability, readability, and similarity of the data that a recently created NLP-based artificial intelligence model ChatGPT 4 provides to users in Cleft Lip and Palate (CLP)-related information. DESIGN: In the evaluation of the responses provided by the OpenAI ChatGPT to the CLP-related 50 questions, several tools were utilized, including the Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool, Reliability Scoring System (Adapted from DISCERN), Flesh Reading Ease Formula (FRES) and Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL) formulas, Global Quality Scale (GQS), and Similarity Index with plagiarism-detection tool. Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2022, version 2.3; Sydney, Australia) software was used for all statistical analyses. RESULTS: Based on the reliability and GQS values, ChatGPT demonstrated high reliability and good quality attributable to CLP. Furthermore, according to the FRES results, ChatGPT's readability is difficult, and the similarity index values of this software exhibit an acceptable level of similarity ratio. There is no significant difference in EQIP, Reliability Score System, FRES, FKGRL, GQS, and Similarity Index values among the two categories. CONCLUSION: OpenAI ChatGPT provides a highly reliable, high-quality, but challenging to read, and acceptable similarity rate in providing information related to CLP. Ensuring that information obtained through these models is verified and assessed by a qualified medical expert is crucial.

Title: Duration of the psychosis prodrome and its relationship to duration of untreated psychosis across all 12 DSM-IV psychotic diagnoses: Evidence for a trans-diagnostic process associated with resilience.
Author: ['Nkire N', 'Kinsella A', 'Russell V', 'Waddington JL']
Journal Title: European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: While duration of the psychosis prodrome (DPP) attracts attention in relation to the developmental trajectory of psychotic illness and service models, fundamental issues endure in the context of dimensional-spectrum models of psychosis. Among 205 epidemiologically representative subjects in the Cavan-Monaghan First Episode Psychosis Study, DPP was systematically quantified and compared, for the first time, across all 12 DSM-IV psychotic diagnoses. DPP was also compared with duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and each was then analysed in relation to premorbid features across three age ranges: <12, 12-15 and 16-18 years. For each diagnosis, medians for both DPP and DUP were shorter than means, indicating common right-skewed distributions. Rank orders for both DPP and DUP were longest for schizophrenia, intermediate for other schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses, psychotic depression and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, and shortest for brief psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder and substance-induced psychotic disorder, though with overlapping right-skewed distributions. DPP was longer than DUP for all diagnoses except substance-induced psychotic disorder. Across functional psychotic diagnoses, longer DPP was predicted by higher premorbid intelligence and better premorbid adjustment during age 16-18 years. These findings indicate that, trans-diagnostically, DPP and DUP share right-skewed continuities, in accordance with a dimensional-spectrum model of psychotic illness, and may reflect a unitary process that has been dichotomized at a subjective threshold along its trajectory. Better premorbid functioning during age 16-18 years appears to confer resilience by delaying progression to overt psychotic symptoms and may constitute a particular target period for psychosocial interventions.

Journal Title: Pathology, research and practice
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 16
Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) platform was trained by a consultant histopathologist to classify whole slide images (WSIs) of large bowel biopsies. Six medical students viewed WSIs of five large bowel biopsy cases and assigned the WSIs to one of the nine diagnostic categories. Then the students compared their answers with those generated by the AI. This training was repeated for a total of six rounds of five cases, and the accuracy of the students was recorded for each round. Each case had one or more WSIs. The student with the best final accuracy was asked to describe the morphological features that they had deduced. All the students improved during their training, from a mean accuracy of 13.7% in the first round to a mean accuracy of 77.1% in the sixth round (p = 0.0011). The student-deduced diagnostic features were mainly accurate. Some students learned more quickly than others.

Title: Informed consent for artificial intelligence in emergency medicine: A practical guide.
Author: ['Iserson KV']
Journal Title: The American journal of emergency medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 25
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) expands its presence in healthcare, particularly within emergency medicine (EM), there is growing urgency to explore the ethical and practical considerations surrounding its adoption. AI holds the potential to revolutionize how emergency physicians (EPs) make clinical decisions, but AI's complexity often surpasses EPs' capacity to provide patients with informed consent regarding its use. This article underscores the crucial need to address the ethical pitfalls of AI in EM. Patient autonomy necessitates that EPs engage in conversations with patients about whether to use AI in their evaluation and treatment. As clinical AI integration expands, this discussion should become an integral part of the informed consent process, aligning with ethical and legal requirements. The rapid availability of AI programs, fueled by vast electronic health record (EHR) datasets, has led to increased pressure on hospitals and clinicians to embrace clinical AI without comprehensive system evaluation. However, the evolving landscape of AI technology outpaces our ability to anticipate its impact on medical practice and patient care. The central question arises: Are EPs equipped with the necessary knowledge to offer well-informed consent regarding clinical AI? Collaborative efforts between EPs, bioethicists, AI researchers, and healthcare administrators are essential for the development and implementation of optimal AI practices in EM. To facilitate informed consent about AI, EPs should understand at least seven key areas: (1) how AI systems operate; (2) whether AI systems are understandable and trustworthy; (3) the limitations of and errors AI systems make; (4) how disagreements between the EP and AI are resolved; (5) whether the patient's personally identifiable information (PII) and the AI computer systems will be secure; (6) if the AI system functions reliably (has been validated); and (7) if the AI program exhibits bias. This article addresses each of these critical issues, aiming to empower EPs with the knowledge required to navigate the intersection of AI and informed consent in EM.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 21
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an intractable disease with frequent recurrence after resection and adjuvant therapy. The present study aimed to clarify whether artificial intelligence-assisted analysis of histopathological images can predict recurrence in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent resection and adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur/5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine/potassium oxonate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the study. Machine-learning algorithms were applied to 10-billion-scale pixel data of whole-slide histopathological images to generate key features using multiple deep autoencoders. Areas under the curve were calculated from receiver operating characteristic curves using a support vector machine with key features alone and by combining with clinical data (age and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels) for predicting recurrence. Supervised learning with pathological annotations was conducted to determine the significant features for predicting recurrence. RESULTS: Areas under the curves obtained were 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.87) by the histopathological data analysis and 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.94) by the combinatorial analysis of histopathological data and clinical data. Supervised learning model demonstrated that poor tumor differentiation was significantly associated with recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that machine learning with the integration of artificial intelligence-driven evaluation of histopathological images and conventional clinical data provides relevant prognostic information for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
