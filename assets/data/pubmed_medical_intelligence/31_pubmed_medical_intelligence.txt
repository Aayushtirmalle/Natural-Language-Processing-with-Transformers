Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: Characterizing structural and dynamic properties of proteins and large macromolecular assemblies is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions. In the field of structural biology, no single method comprehensively reveals the behavior of biological systems across various spatiotemporal scales. Instead, we have a versatile toolkit of techniques, each contributing a piece to the overall puzzle. Integrative structural biology combines different techniques to create accurate and precise multi-scale models that expand our understanding of complex biological systems. This review outlines recent advancements in computational and experimental methods in structural biology, with special focus on recent Artificial Intelligence techniques, emphasizes integrative approaches that combine different types of data for precise spatiotemporal modeling, and provides an outlook into future directions of this field.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Stimulated Raman histology is an innovative technology that generates real-time, high-resolution microscopic images of unprocessed tissue, significantly reducing prostate biopsy interpretation time. This study aims to evaluate the ability for an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to interpretate prostate biopsy histologic images created with stimulated Raman histology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unprocessed, unlabeled prostate biopsies were prospectively imaged using a stimulated Raman histology microscope. Following stimulated Raman histology creation, the cores underwent standard pathological processing and interpretation by at least 2 genitourinary pathologists to establish a ground truth assessment. A network, trained on 303 prostate biopsies from 100 participants, was used to measure the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of detecting prostate cancer on stimulated Raman histology relative to conventional pathology. The performance of the artificial intelligence was evaluated on an independent 113-biopsy test set. RESULTS: Prostate biopsy images obtained through stimulated Raman histology can be generated within a time frame of 2 to 2.75 minutes. The artificial intelligence system achieved a rapid classification of prostate biopsies with cancer, with a potential identification time of approximately 1 minute. The artificial intelligence demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 96.5% in detecting prostate cancer. Moreover, the artificial intelligence exhibited a sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 96.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulated Raman histology generates microscopic images capable of accurately identifying prostate cancer in real time, without the need for sectioning or tissue processing. These images can be interpreted by artificial intelligence, providing physicians with near-real-time pathological feedback during the diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer.

Publication Date: 2023 Nov 27
Abstract: Amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a protein-misfolding disease characterized by fibril accumulation in the extracellular space that can result in local tissue disruption and organ dysfunction. Cardiac involvement drives morbidity and mortality, and the heart is the major organ affected by ATTR amyloidosis. Multimodality cardiac imaging (ie, echocardiography, scintigraphy, and cardiac magnetic resonance) allows accurate diagnosis of ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), and this is of particular importance because ATTR-targeting therapies have become available and probably exert their greatest benefit at earlier disease stages. Apart from establishing the diagnosis, multimodality cardiac imaging may help to better understand pathogenesis, predict prognosis, and monitor treatment response. The aim of this review is to give an update on contemporary and evolving cardiac imaging methods and their role in diagnosing and managing ATTR-CM. Further, an outlook is presented on how artificial intelligence in cardiac imaging may improve future clinical decision making and patient management in the setting of ATTR-CM.

Abstract: Pain perception nociceptors (PPN), an important type of sensory neuron, are capable of sending out alarm signals when the human body is exposed to destructive stimuli. Simulating the human ability to perceive the external environment and spontaneously avoid injury is a critical function of neural sensing of artificial intelligence devices. The demand for developing artificial PPN has subsequently increased. However, due to the application scenarios of bionic electronic devices such as human skin, electronic prostheses, and robot bodies, where a certain degree of surface deformation constantly occurs, the ideal artificial PPN should have the stretchability to adapt to real scenarios. Here, an organic semiconductor nanofiber artificial pain perception nociceptor (NAPPN) based on a pre-stretching strategy is demonstrated to achieve key pain aspects such as threshold, sensitization, and desensitization. Remarkably, while stretching up to 50%, the synaptic behaviors and injury warning ability of NAPPN can be retained. To verify the wearability of the device, NAPPN was attached to a curved human finger joint, on which PPN behaviors were successfully mimicked. This provides a promising strategy for realizing neural sensing function on either deformed or mobile electronic devices.

Title: Using artificial intelligence to promote equitable care for inpatients with language barriers and complex medical needs: clinical stakeholder perspectives.
Author: ['Barwise AK', 'Curtis S', 'Diedrich DA', 'Pickering BW']
Journal Title: Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Inpatients with language barriers and complex medical needs suffer disparities in quality of care, safety, and health outcomes. Although in-person interpreters are particularly beneficial for these patients, they are underused. We plan to use machine learning predictive analytics to reliably identify patients with language barriers and complex medical needs to prioritize them for in-person interpreters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study used stakeholder engagement through semi-structured interviews to understand the perceived risks and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. Stakeholders included clinicians, interpreters, and personnel involved in caring for these patients or for organizing interpreters. Data were coded and analyzed using NVIVO software. RESULTS: We completed 49 interviews. Key perceived risks included concerns about transparency, accuracy, redundancy, privacy, perceived stigmatization among patients, alert fatigue, and supply-demand issues. Key perceived benefits included increased awareness of in-person interpreters, improved standard of care and prioritization for interpreter utilization; a streamlined process for accessing interpreters, empowered clinicians, and potential to overcome clinician bias. DISCUSSION: This is the first study that elicits stakeholder perspectives on the use of AI with the goal of improved clinical care for patients with language barriers. Perceived benefits and risks related to the use of AI in this domain, overlapped with known hazards and values of AI but some benefits were unique for addressing challenges with providing interpreter services to patients with language barriers. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence to identify and prioritize patients for interpreter services has the potential to improve standard of care and address healthcare disparities among patients with language barriers.

Author: ['Sidhu Z', 'Mansoori T']
Journal Title: Indian journal of ophthalmology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 15
Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for glaucoma detection using deep learning algorithm and evaluate its accuracy for image classification of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) from color fundus photographs. METHODS: A total of 1375 color fundus photographs, 735 normal optic nerve head and 640 GON, were uploaded on the AI software for training, validation, and testing using deep learning model, which is based on Residual Network (Res Net) 50V2. For initial training and validation, 400 fundus images (200 normal and 200 GON) were uploaded and for the final training and testing 975 (535 normal and 440 GON) were uploaded later. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the image classification performance of the algorithm. Also, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. RESULTS: The model used in the study showed an image classification accuracy of 81.3%, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 80% for the detection of GON. The false-negative grading was 17% and false-positive grading was 20% for the image classification of GON. Coexistence of glaucoma in patients with high myopia, early glaucoma in a small disc, and software misclassification of GON were the reasons for false-negative results. Physiological large cupping in a large disc, myopic or titled disc, and software misclassification of normal optic disc were the reasons for false-positive results. CONCLUSION: The model employed in this study achieved a good accuracy, and hence has a good potential in detection of GON using color fundus photographs.

Title: Harnessing the translational power of bleomycin model: new insights to guide drug discovery for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Author: ['Murgo A', 'Bignami F', 'Federico G', 'Villetti G', 'Civelli M', 'Sala A', 'Miglietta D']
Journal Title: Frontiers in pharmacology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, age-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) with limited therapeutic options. Despite the wide variety of different in vivo models for IPF, these preclinical models have shown limitations that may significantly impair their translational potential. Among the most relevant limitations are the methodologies used to assess the efficacy of anti-fibrotic treatments, that are not the ones used in humans. In this scenario, the goal of the work presented in this paper is to provide translational relevance to the bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model, introducing and validating novel readouts to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for IPF. Methods: The BLM model was optimized by introducing the use of functional assessments such as the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and the Diffusion Factor for Carbon Monoxide (DFCO), that are respectively the primary and secondary endpoints in clinical trials for IPF, comparing them to more common readouts such as lung histology, improved by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect and quantify fibrotic tissue deposition, and metalloproitenase-7 (MMP-7), a clinical prognostic biomarker. Results: Lung function measurement and DFCO changes well correlated with Ashcroft score, the current gold-standard for the assessment of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. The relevance and robustness of these novel readouts in the BLM model was confirmed by the results obtained testing Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, the only drugs approved for the treatment of IPF patients: in fact, both drugs administered therapeutically, significantly affected the changes in these parameters induced by BLM treatment, with results that closely reflected the efficacy observed in the clinic. Changes in biomarkers such as MMP-7 were also evaluated, and well correlated with the modifications of FVC and DFCO. Conclusion: Novel functional readouts such as FVC and DFCO can be efficiently used to assess pathology progression in the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model as well as compound efficacy, substantially improving its translational and predictivity potential.

Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cannabis may offer therapeutic benefits to patients with advanced cancer not responding adequately to conventional palliative treatment. However, tolerability is a major concern. Cognitive function is a potential adverse reaction to tetrahydrocannabinol containing regimens. The aim of this study was to test cognitive function in patients being prescribed dronabinol as an adjuvant palliative therapy. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced cancer and severe related pain refractory to conventional palliative treatment were included in this case-series study. Patients were examined at baseline in conjunction with initiation of dronabinol therapy and at a two-week follow-up using three selected Wechsler's adult intelligence scale III neurocognitive tests: Processing Speed Index (PSI), Perceptual Organization Index (POI), and Working Memory Index (WMI). Patients were also assessed using pain visual analog scale, Major Depression Inventory, and Brief Fatigue Inventory. RESULTS: Eight patients consented to take part in the study. Two patients discontinued dronabinol therapy, one due to a complaint of dizziness and another critical progression of cancer disease, respectively. The remaining six patients were successfully treated with a daily dosage of 12.5 mg dronabinol (p = 0.039). PSI (p = 0.020), POI (p = 0.034.), and WMI (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function improved in this group of patients with advanced cancer in conjunction with low-dose dronabinol therapy. The cause is likely multifactorial including reported relief of cancer-associated symptoms. Further clinical investigation is required.

Title: Prediction of self-efficacy in recognizing deepfakes based on personality traits .
Author: ['Abraham J', 'Putra HA', 'Prayoga T', 'Warnars HLHS', 'Manurung RH', 'Nainggolan T']
Journal Title: F1000Research
Publication Date: 2022
Abstract: Background: While deepfake technology is still relatively new, concerns are increasing as they are getting harder to spot. The first question we need to ask is how good humans are at recognizing deepfakes - the realistic-looking videos or images that show people doing or saying things that they never actually did or said generated by an artificial intelligence-based technology. Research has shown that an individual's self-efficacy correlates with their ability to detect deepfakes. Previous studies suggest that one of the most fundamental predictors of self-efficacy are personality traits. In this study, we ask the question: how can people's personality traits influence their efficacy in recognizing deepfakes? Methods: Predictive correlational design with a multiple linear regression data analysis technique was used in this study. The participants of this study were 200 Indonesian young adults. Results: The results showed that only traits of Honesty-humility and Agreeableness were able to predict the efficacy, in the negative and positive directions, respectively. Meanwhile, traits of Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness cannot predict it. Conclusion: Self-efficacy in spotting deepfakes can be predicted by certain personality traits.

Abstract: Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, particularly in radiation oncology. AI-based contouring tools like Limbus are designed to delineate Organs at Risk (OAR) and Target Volumes quickly. This study evaluates the accuracy and efficiency of AI contouring compared to human radiation oncologists and the ability of professionals to differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated contours. Methods At a recent AI conference in Abu Dhabi, a blind comparative analysis was performed to assess AI's performance in radiation oncology. Participants included four human radiation oncologists and the Limbus(R) AI software. They contoured specific regions from CT scans of a breast cancer patient. The audience, consisting of healthcare professionals and AI experts, was challenged to identify the AI-generated contours. The exercise was repeated twice to observe any learning effects. Time taken for contouring and audience identification accuracy were recorded. Results Initially, only 28% of the audience correctly identified the AI contours, which slightly increased to 31% in the second attempt. This indicated a difficulty in distinguishing between AI and human expertise. The AI completed contouring in up to 60 seconds, significantly faster than the human average of 8 minutes. Discussion The results indicate that AI can perform radiation contouring comparably to human oncologists but much faster. The challenge faced by professionals in identifying AI versus human contours highlights AI's advanced capabilities in medical tasks. Conclusion AI shows promise in enhancing radiation oncology workflow by reducing contouring time without quality compromise. Further research is needed to confirm AI contouring's clinical efficacy and its integration into routine practice.

Journal Title: Frontiers in microbiology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The efficacy of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents in combating bacterial infections faces a grave peril in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an exceedingly pressing global health issue. The emergence and dissemination of drug-resistant bacteria can be attributed to the rampant overuse and misuse of antibiotics, leading to dire consequences such as organ failure and sepsis. Beyond the realm of individual health, the pervasive specter of AMR casts its ominous shadow upon the economy and society at large, resulting in protracted hospital stays, elevated medical expenditures, and diminished productivity, with particularly dire consequences for vulnerable populations. It is abundantly clear that addressing this ominous threat necessitates a concerted international endeavor encompassing the optimization of antibiotic deployment, the pursuit of novel antimicrobial compounds and therapeutic strategies, the enhancement of surveillance and monitoring of resistant bacterial strains, and the assurance of universal access to efficacious treatments. In the ongoing struggle against this encroaching menace, phage-based therapies, strategically tailored to combat AMR, offer a formidable line of defense. Furthermore, an alluring pathway forward for the development of vaccines lies in the utilization of virus-like particles (VLPs), which have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to elicit a robust immune response against bacterial infections. VLP-based vaccinations, characterized by their absence of genetic material and non-infectious nature, present a markedly safer and more stable alternative to conventional immunization protocols. Encouragingly, preclinical investigations have yielded promising results in the development of VLP vaccines targeting pivotal bacteria implicated in the AMR crisis, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium difficile. Notwithstanding the undeniable potential of VLP vaccines, formidable challenges persist, including the identification of suitable bacterial markers for vaccination and the formidable prospect of bacterial pathogens evolving mechanisms to thwart the immune response. Nonetheless, the prospect of VLP-based vaccines holds great promise in the relentless fight against AMR, underscoring the need for sustained research and development endeavors. In the quest to marshal more potent defenses against AMR and to pave the way for visionary innovations, cutting-edge techniques that incorporate RNA interference, nanomedicine, and the integration of artificial intelligence are currently under rigorous scrutiny.

Title: A bibliometric analysis on discovering anti-quorum sensing agents against clinically relevant pathogens: current status, development, and future directions.
Author: ['Peng B', 'Li Y', 'Yin J', 'Ding W', 'Fazuo W', 'Xiao Z', 'Yin H']
Journal Title: Frontiers in microbiology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quorum sensing is bacteria's ability to communicate and regulate their behavior based on population density. Anti-quorum sensing agents (anti-QSA) is promising strategy to treat resistant infections, as well as reduce selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance of clinically relevant pathogens. This study analyzes the output, hotspots, and trends of research in the field of anti-QSA against clinically relevant pathogens. METHODS: The literature on anti-QSA from the Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved and analyzed. Tools such as CiteSpace and Alluvial Generator were used to visualize and interpret the data. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2023, the number of publications related to anti-QAS research increased rapidly, with a total of 1,743 articles and reviews published in 558 journals. The United States was the largest contributor and the most influential country, with an H-index of 88, higher than other countries. Williams was the most productive author, and Hoiby N was the most cited author. Frontiers in Microbiology was the most prolific and the most cited journal. Burst detection indicated that the main frontier disciplines shifted from MICROBIOLOGY, CLINICAL, MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, and other biomedicine-related fields to FOOD, MATERIALS, NATURAL PRODUCTS, and MULTIDISCIPLINARY. In the whole research history, the strongest burst keyword was cystic-fibrosis patients, and the strongest burst reference was Lee and Zhang (2015). In the latest period (burst until 2023), the strongest burst keyword was silver nanoparticle, and the strongest burst reference was Whiteley et al. (2017). The co-citation network revealed that the most important interest and research direction was anti-biofilm/anti-virulence drug development, and timeline analysis suggested that this direction is also the most active. The key concepts alluvial flow visualization revealed seven terms with the longest time span and lasting until now, namely Escherichia coli, virulence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, virulence factor, bacterial biofilm, gene expression, quorum sensing. Comprehensive analysis shows that nanomaterials, marine natural products, and artificial intelligence (AI) may become hotspots in the future. CONCLUSION: This bibliometric study reveals the current status and trends of anti-QSA research and may assist researchers in identifying hot topics and exploring new research directions.

Journal Title: Frontiers in psychology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise is one of the most relevant lifestyle choices for the prevention of diseases; however, participation in this type of activity remains low. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the understanding of related psychological factors in men and women. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether personality traits, emotional intelligence and negative affective are differentially related to physical exercise characteristics in men and women. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 579 physically active people (61.1% men) between 18 and 59 years of age. The Big Five Inventory (BFI-15p), Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale (EQ-i-M20), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used. RESULTS: Compared with men, women exercised fewer days and minutes per week, had fewer years of participation and performed fewer different physical exercises. On the emotional intelligence scale, compared with men, women showed less stress management, adaptability and general mood but greater interpersonal intelligence. With regard to personality traits, compared with men, women showed greater openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In males, heightened levels of general mood and extraversion were associated to a lasting commitment to physical exercise over time. Conversely, in females, depression was negatively associated with the years dedicated to physical exercise. CONCLUSION: Distinct approaches are essential for men and women, acknowledging the varied ways psychological factors are linked to physical exercise based on gender.

Abstract: Highly robust flexible multifunctional film with excellent electromagnetic interference shielding and electrothermal/photothermal characteristics are highly desirable for aerospace, military, and wearable devices. Herein, an asymmetric gradient multilayer structured bacterial cellulose@Fe(3) O(4) /carbon nanotube/Ti(3) C(2) T(x) (BC@Fe(3) O(4) /CNT/Ti(3) C(2) T(x) ) multifunctional composite film is fabricated with simultaneously demonstrating fast Joule response, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) and photothermal conversion properties. The asymmetric gradient 6-layer composite film with 40% of Ti(3) C(2) T(x) possesses excellent mechanical performance with exceptional tensile strength (76.1 MPa), large strain (14.7%), and good flexibility. This is attributed to the asymmetric gradient multilayer structure designed based on the hydrogen bonding self-assembly strategy between Ti(3) C(2) T(x) and BC. It achieved an EMI SE of up to 71.3 dB, which is attributed to the gradient "absorption-reflection-reabsorption" mechanism. Furthermore, this composite film also exhibits excellent low-voltage-driven Joule heating (up to 80.3  degrees C at 2.5 V within 15 s) and fast-response photothermal performance (up to 101.5  degrees C at 1.0 W cm(-2) within 10 s), which is attributed to the synergistic effect of heterostructure. This work demonstrates the fabrication of multifunctional bacterial cellulose@Fe(3) O(4) /carbon nanotube/Ti(3) C(2) T(x) composite film has promising potentials for next-generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, aerospace, and artificial intelligence.

Title: Is intelligence of preterm children different from full-term children? Commentary on Rapuc et al. (2023).
Author: ['Demetriou A']
Journal Title: Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: Rapuc et al. (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2023) found that Full-Scale IQ of preterm children is significantly lower than full-term children. Also, although the structure of intelligence appeared to involve the same clusters of cognitive ability, relations between abilities were stronger in preterm children, implying that abilities are more differentiated in full-term than in preterm children. This commentary examined if these findings hold when different modelling methods are used. Instead of the network analysis used in the target article (Rapuc et al., 2023), I used confirmatory factor analysis and special forms of structural equation modelling designed to capture interactions between processes and their differentiation from general cognitive ability. I found, in line with the target article, that premature children scored lower overall in cognitive ability, and that cognitive processes are more strongly related in preterm than in full-term children. However, in contrast to the target article, specific abilities tended to differentiate with increasing general ability in preterm rather than in full-term children. In full-term children, increases in specific abilities were commensurate with increases in general ability. These differences may reflect slower development in preterm children and stronger dependence on executive processes dominating in preschool. Clinical implications are discussed.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical education and practice is a significant development. This study examined the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of health professions' students in Jordan concerning AI, providing insights into their preparedness and perceptions. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to 483 Jordanian health professions' students via social media. Demographic data, AI-related KAP, and barriers were collected. Quantile regression models analyzed associations between variables and KAP scores. RESULTS: Moderate AI knowledge was observed among participants, with specific understanding of data requirements and barriers. Attitudes varied, combining skepticism about AI replacing human teachers with recognition of its value. While AI tools were used for specific tasks, broader integration in medical education and practice was limited. Barriers included lack of knowledge, access, time constraints, and curriculum gaps. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need to enhance medical education with AI topics and address barriers. Students need to be better prepared for AI integration, in order to enable medical education to harness AI's potential for improved patient care and training.

Title: Performance analysis of conventional and AI-based variant callers using short and long reads.
Author: ['Abdelwahab O', 'Belzile F', 'Torkamaneh D']
Journal Title: BMC bioinformatics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 14
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The accurate detection of variants is essential for genomics-based studies. Currently, there are various tools designed to detect genomic variants, however, it has always been a challenge to decide which tool to use, especially when various major genome projects have chosen to use different tools. Thus far, most of the existing tools were mainly developed to work on short-read data (i.e., Illumina); however, other sequencing technologies (e.g. PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore) have recently shown that they can also be used for variant calling. In addition, with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based variant calling tools, there is a pressing need to compare these tools in terms of efficiency, accuracy, computational power, and ease of use. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated five of the most widely used conventional and AI-based variant calling tools (BCFTools, GATK4, Platypus, DNAscope, and DeepVariant) in terms of accuracy and computational cost using both short-read and long-read data derived from three different sequencing technologies (Illumina, PacBio HiFi, and ONT) for the same set of samples from the Genome In A Bottle project. The analysis showed that AI-based variant calling tools supersede conventional ones for calling SNVs and INDELs using both long and short reads in most aspects. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of each tool while ranking them in each aspect of these comparisons. CONCLUSION: This study provides best practices for variant calling using AI-based and conventional variant callers with different types of sequencing data.

Abstract: The photovoltaic system is quickly emerging as a highly favored option among renewable energy sources. However, it faces several significant challenges, including variable solar irradiance, temperature, and partial shading. Unfortunately, conventional Maximum Power Point Trackers (MPPTs) cannot accurately track partial shading. Artificial intelligence and optimization techniques have been proposed as alternatives, but they require extensive training and can take a long time to achieve maximum power point (MPP) under partial shading circumstances. In this paper, a dynamic and fast-moving method of MPP tracking is proposed for use under both uniform solar irradiance and partial shade. This method combines an enhanced incremental conductance (INC) algorithm with a global search algorithm that looks at how well solar cells work when partly shaded. Simulation investigations are performed to validate the method's applicability and ensure that it reaches the most accurate value of MPP with a short-tracking time of less than 0.2 s and a steady-state error of less than 0.3% of the PV power. The results confirm the efficacy of the suggested tracking method under uniform solar irradiance and partial shade.
