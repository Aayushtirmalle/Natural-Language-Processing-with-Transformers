Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) are often not reported by radiologists on routine chest radiographs. This study aims to investigate the clinical value of a newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Ofeye 1.0, for automated detection of OVFs on lateral chest radiographs in post-menopausal women (>60 years) who were referred to undergo chest x-rays for other reasons. A total of 510 de-identified lateral chest radiographs from three clinical sites were retrieved and analysed using the Ofeye 1.0 tool. These images were then reviewed by a consultant radiologist with findings serving as the reference standard for determining the diagnostic performance of the AI tool for the detection of OVFs. Of all the original radiologist reports, missed OVFs were found in 28.8% of images but were detected using the AI tool. The AI tool demonstrated high specificity of 92.8% (95% CI: 89.6, 95.2%), moderate accuracy of 80.3% (95% CI: 76.3, 80.4%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 73.7% (95% CI: 65.2, 80.8%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.5% (95% CI: 79, 83.8%), but low sensitivity of 49% (95% CI: 40.7, 57.3%). The AI tool showed improved sensitivity compared with the original radiologist reports, which was 20.8% (95% CI: 14.5, 28.4). The new AI tool can be used as a complementary tool in routine diagnostic reports for the reduction in missed OVFs in elderly women.

Abstract: Third molar surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Considering the patient's young age and the often-elective nature of the procedure, a comprehensive preoperative evaluation of the surgical site, relying heavily on preoperative imaging, is key to providing accurate diagnostic work-up, evidence-based clinical decision making, and, when appropriate, indication-specific surgical planning. Given the rapid developments of dental imaging in the field, the aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date clinical overview of various imaging techniques related to perioperative imaging in third molar surgery, ranging from panoramic radiography to emerging technologies, such as photon-counting computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Each modality's advantages, limitations, and recent improvements are evaluated, highlighting their role in treatment planning, complication prevention, and postoperative follow-ups. The integration of recent technological advances, including artificial intelligence and machine learning in biomedical imaging, coupled with a thorough preoperative clinical evaluation, marks another step towards personalized dentistry in high-risk third molar surgery. This approach enables minimally invasive surgical approaches while reducing inefficiencies and risks by incorporating additional imaging modality- and patient-specific parameters, potentially facilitating and improving patient management.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous neoplasm accounting for the second most prevalent hematologic disorder. The identification of noninvasive, valuable biomarkers is of utmost importance for the best patient treatment selection, especially in heterogeneous diseases like MM. Despite molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) has achieved a primary role in the characterization of MM, it is not free from shortcomings. In recent years, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, have played an important role in mining additional information from medical images beyond human eyes' resolving power. Our review provides a summary of the current status of radiomics and AI in different clinical contexts of MM. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted, including all the articles published in English that explored radiomics and AI analyses of PET/CT images in MM. The initial results have highlighted the potential role of such new features in order to improve the clinical stratification of MM patients, as well as to increase their clinical benefits. However, more studies are warranted before these approaches can be implemented in clinical routines.

Abstract: In recent years, many studies have analyzed the importance of integrating time, or aging, into the equation that relates genetics and the environment to the development and origin of COPD. Under conditions of daily clinical practice, our study attempts to identify the differences in the clinical profile of patients with COPD according to age and the impact on the global burden of the disease. This study is non-interventional and observational, using artificial intelligence and data captured from electronic medical records. The study population included patients who were diagnosed with COPD between 2011 and 2021. A total of 73,901 patients had a diagnosis of COPD. The mean age was 73 years (95% CI: 72.9-73.1), and 56,763 were men (76.8%). We observed a specific prevalence of obesity, heart failure, depression, and hiatal hernia in women (p < 0.001), and ischemic heart disease and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in men (p < 0.001). In the analysis by age ranges, a progressive increase in cardiovascular risk factors was observed with age. In conclusion, in a real-life setting, COPD is a disease that primarily affects older subjects and frequently presents with comorbidities that are decisive in the evolutionary course of the disease.

Abstract: We sought to prospectively investigate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment using a hand-held ultrasound device (HUD) in COVID-19 patients and to examine whether reduced LVEF predicts the composite endpoint of in-hospital death, advanced ventilatory support, shock, myocardial injury, and acute decompensated heart failure. COVID-19 patients were evaluated with a real-time LVEF assessment using an HUD equipped with an AI-based tool vs. assessment by a blinded fellowship-trained echocardiographer. Among 42 patients, those with LVEF < 50% were older with more comorbidities and unfavorable exam characteristics. An excellent correlation was demonstrated between the AI and the echocardiographer LVEF assessment (0.774, p < 0.001). Substantial agreement was demonstrated between the two assessments (kappa = 0.797, p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the HUD for this threshold were 72.7% 100%, 100%, and 91.2%, respectively. AI-based LVEF < 50% was associated with worse composite endpoints; unadjusted OR = 11.11 (95% CI 2.25-54.94), p = 0.003; adjusted OR = 6.40 (95% CI 1.07-38.09, p = 0.041). An AI-based algorithm incorporated into an HUD can be utilized reliably as a decision support tool for automatic real-time LVEF assessment among COVID-19 patients and may identify patients at risk for unfavorable outcomes. Future larger cohorts should verify the association with outcomes.

Abstract: Down syndrome arises from chromosomal non-disjunction during gametogenesis, resulting in an additional chromosome. This anomaly presents with intellectual impairment, growth limitations, and distinct facial features. Positive correlation exists between maternal age, particularly in advanced cases, and the global annual incidence is over 200,000 cases. Early interventions, including first and second-trimester screenings, have improved DS diagnosis and care. The manifestations of Down syndrome result from complex interactions between genetic factors linked to various health concerns. To explore recent advancements in Down syndrome research, we focus on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for improved diagnosis and management. Recent developments leverage AI and ML algorithms to detect subtle Down syndrome indicators across various data sources, including biological markers, facial traits, and medical images. These technologies offer potential enhancements in accuracy, particularly in cases complicated by cognitive impairments. Integration of AI and ML in Down syndrome diagnosis signifies a significant advancement in medical science. These tools hold promise for early detection, personalized treatment, and a deeper comprehension of the complex interplay between genetics and environmental factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of neurodevelopmental and cognitive profiles, comorbidities, diagnosis, and management within the Down syndrome context. The utilization of AI and ML represents a transformative step toward enhancing early identification and tailored interventions for individuals with Down syndrome, ultimately improving their quality of life.

Abstract: Prognostic markers in routine clinical management of breast cancer are often assessed using RNA-based multi-gene panels that depend on fluctuating tumor purity. Multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mfIHC) holds the potential for an improved risk assessment. To enable automated prognosis marker detection (i.e., progesterone receptor [PR], estrogen receptor [ER], androgen receptor [AR], GATA3, TROP2, HER2, PD-L1, Ki67, TOP2A), a framework for automated breast cancer identification was developed and validated involving thirteen different artificial intelligence analysis steps and an algorithm for cell distance analysis using 11+1-marker-BLEACH&STAIN-mfIHC staining in 1404 invasive breast cancers of no special type (NST). The framework for automated breast cancer detection discriminated normal glands from malignant glands with an accuracy of 98.4%. This approach identified that five (PR, ER, AR, GATA3, PD-L1) of nine biomarkers were associated with prolonged overall survival (p </= 0.0095 each) and two of these (PR, AR) were found to be independent risk factors in multivariate analysis (p </= 0.0151 each). The combined assessment of PR-ER-AR-GATA3-PD-L1 as a five-marker prognosis score showed strong prognostic relevance (p < 0.0001) and was an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis (p = 0.0034). Automated breast cancer detection in combination with an artificial intelligence-based analysis of mfIHC enables a rapid and reliable analysis of multiple prognostic parameters. The strict limitation of the analysis to malignant cells excludes the impact of fluctuating tumor purity on assay precision.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into drug discovery has markedly advanced the search for effective therapeutics. In our study, we employed a comprehensive computational-experimental approach to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. We developed a predictive model to assess the activities of compounds based on their structural features. This model screened a library of approximately 700,000 compounds, culminating in the selection of the top 100 candidates for experimental validation. In vitro assays on human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) revealed that 19 of these compounds exhibited inhibitory activity. Notably, eight compounds demonstrated dose-dependent activity in Vero cell lines, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 1 muM to 7 muM. Furthermore, we utilized a clustering approach to pinpoint potential nucleoside analog inhibitors, leading to the discovery of two promising candidates: azathioprine and its metabolite, thioinosinic acid. Both compounds showed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, with thioinosinic acid also significantly reducing viral loads in mouse lungs. These findings underscore the utility of AI in accelerating drug discovery processes.

Journal Title: Brain sciences
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 3
Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term benefits of cochlear implantation (CI) on cognitive performance, speech perception, and psychological status in post-lingually deafened patients older than 65 (n = 33). Patients were consecutively enrolled in this prospective study and assessed before, one year after, and two years after CI for speech perception, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and working memory and processing speed. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was used for the latter. Thirty-three patients (fourteen men and nineteen women) were included. The scores indicating "hearing in quiet" and "hearing with background noise" improved significantly one year after CI and remained so two years after CI. The sound localization scores improved two years after CI. The depressive symptoms and perceived stress scores were low at the study's onset and remained unchanged. Working memory improved significantly two years after CI, while processing speed improved significantly one year after CI and was maintained after that. The improvement in working memory and processing speed two years after CI suggests there is a sustained positive effect of auditory rehabilitation with CI on cognitive abilities.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 1
Abstract: After recovering from the acute COVID-19 illness, a substantial proportion of people continue experiencing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also termed "long COVID". Their quality of life is adversely impacted by persistent cognitive dysfunction and affective distress, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study recruited a group of mostly young, previously healthy adults (24.4 +/- 5.2 years of age) who experienced PASC for almost 6 months following a mild acute COVID-19 illness. Confirming prior evidence, they reported noticeable memory and attention deficits, brain fog, depression/anxiety, fatigue, and other symptoms potentially suggestive of excitation/inhibition imbalance. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was used to examine the neurochemical aspects of cell signaling with an emphasis on GABA levels in the occipital cortex. The PASC participants were compared to a control (CNT) group matched in demographics, intelligence, and an array of other variables. Controlling for tissue composition, biological sex, and alcohol intake, the PASC group had lower GABA+/water than CNT, which correlated with depression and poor sleep quality. The mediation analysis revealed that the impact of PASC on depression was partly mediated by lower GABA+/water, indicative of cortical hyperexcitability as an underlying mechanism. In addition, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) tended to be lower in the PASC group, possibly suggesting compromised neuronal integrity. Persistent neuroinflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PASC-related neurocognitive dysfunction.

Abstract: Noonan syndrome (NS) is one of the most common genetic conditions inherited mostly in an autosomal dominant manner with vast heterogeneity in clinical and genetic features. Patients with NS might have speech disturbances, memory and attention deficits, limitations in daily functioning, and decreased overall intelligence. Here, 34 patients with Noonan syndrome and 23 healthy controls were enrolled in a study involving gray and white matter volume evaluation using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), white matter connectivity measurements using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) probability distributions were calculated. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales. Reductions in white matter connectivity were detected using DTI in NS patients. The rs-fMRI revealed hyper-connectivity in NS patients between the sensorimotor network and language network and between the sensorimotor network and salience network in comparison to healthy controls. NS patients exhibited decreased verbal and nonverbal IQ compared to healthy controls. The assessment of the microstructural alterations of white matter as well as the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis in patients with NS may shed light on the mechanisms responsible for cognitive and neurofunctional impairments.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal helminth parasites continue to be a significant threat to the health of equine. OvaCyte Telenostic (OCT) (Telenostic Ltd., Kilkenny, Ireland) has developed an automated digital microscope utilising Artificial Intelligence to identify and count the clinically important helminth species in equine, bovine, and ovine host species. In this paper, the performance of the OCT analyser was evaluated for the detection and counting of equine helminth species parasites and its performance compared to the currently accepted benchmark methods of faecal egg counts being the McMaster and the Mini-FLOTAC techniques. A pairwise comparison of tests was assessed based on the correlation of egg counts and Cohen's kappa agreement statistics for dichotomized outcomes. Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all three techniques in the absence of a gold standard for four helminth parasites (strongyles, Anoplocephala spp., Parascaris spp. and Strongyloides westeri). Based on the analysis of 783 equine faecal samples, we found a high level (rho >/= 0.94) of correlation between each pairwise comparison of techniques for strongyle egg counts. Cohen's kappa agreement between techniques was high for strongyles and S. westeri, moderate for Parascaris spp., and low for Anoplocephala spp. All three techniques had a high sensitivity and specificity (>0.90) for strongyles. Across helminth parasites, the sensitivity of the OCT was the highest of the three techniques evaluated for strongyles (0.98 v 0.96 and 0.94), Anoplocephala spp. (0.86 v 0.44 and 0.46) and Parascaris spp. (0.96 v 0.83 and 0.96); but lowest for S. westeri (0.74 v 0.88 and 0.88), compared to McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC, respectively. In terms of specificity, OCT was the lowest in two species (Parascaris spp. 0.96, Anoplocephala spp. 0.95). In conclusion, OCT has a sensitivity and specificity statistically similar to both McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC, and had a higher correlation with Mini-FLOTAC. The OCT point of care faecal analyser offers improved workflow, test turn-around time and does not require trained laboratory personnel to operate or interpret the results.

Abstract: Terrorist organizations have compelled security authorities of every nation to make an increasingly significant commitment toward mitigating the risk of mass casualties and severe financial and property damages. As a result, various security measures have been implemented, including the use of advanced equipment and an uptick in intelligence activities. One of the most effective tools that has yielded outstanding results is the use of explosive detection dogs (EDDs). The nature of EDDs demands a high level of sensitivity given the inherent danger and severity of real threat situations that may involve the risk of explosion. Moreover, the operating procedures for EDDs are unique and distinguishable from other forms of detection. We conducted a review to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the subject, highlighting the EDDs' personality profile, selection, training methods, performance, and employment, incorporating insights from diverse fields, conducting an analysis, and presenting a perspective on using EDDs to prevent explosion threats.

Journal Title: Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: Real-time performance and reliability are two critical indicators in cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). To meet strict requirements in terms of these indicators, it is necessary to solve complex job-shop scheduling problems (JSPs) and reserve considerable redundant resources for unexpected jobs before production. However, traditional job-shop methods are difficult to apply under dynamic conditions due to the uncertain time cost of transmission and computation. Edge computing offers an efficient solution to this issue. By deploying edge servers around the equipment, smart factories can achieve localized decisions based on computational intelligence (CI) methods offloaded from the cloud. Most works on edge computing have studied task offloading and dispatching scheduling based on CI. However, few of the existing methods can be used for behavior-level control due to the corresponding requirements for ultralow latency (10 ms) and ultrahigh reliability (99.9999% in wireless transmission), especially when unexpected computing jobs arise. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic resource prediction scheduling (DRPS) method based on CI to achieve real-time localized behavior-level control. The proposed DRPS method primarily focuses on the schedulability of unexpected computing jobs, and its core ideas are (1) to predict job arrival times based on a backpropagation neural network and (2) to perform real-time migration in the form of human-computer interaction based on the results of resource analysis. An experimental comparison with existing schemes shows that our DRPS method improves the acceptance ratio by 25.9% compared to the earliest deadline first scheme.

Title: Stable and Fast Deep Mutual Information Maximization Based on Wasserstein Distance.
Author: ['He X', 'Peng C', 'Wang L', 'Tan W', 'Wang Z']
Journal Title: Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 30
Abstract: Deep learning is one of the most exciting and promising techniques in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which drives AI applications to be more intelligent and comprehensive. However, existing deep learning techniques usually require a large amount of expensive labeled data, which limit the application and development of deep learning techniques, and thus it is imperative to study unsupervised machine learning. The learning of deep representations by mutual information estimation and maximization (Deep InfoMax or DIM) method has achieved unprecedented results in the field of unsupervised learning. However, in the DIM method, to restrict the encoder to learn more normalized feature representations, an adversarial network learning method is used to make the encoder output consistent with a priori positively distributed data. As we know, the model training of the adversarial network learning method is difficult to converge, because there is a logarithmic function in the loss function of the cross-entropy measure, and the gradient of the model parameters is susceptible to the "gradient explosion" or "gradient disappearance" phenomena, which makes the training of the DIM method extremely unstable. In this regard, we propose a Wasserstein distance-based DIM method to solve the stability problem of model training, and our method is called the WDIM. Subsequently, the training stability of the WDIM method and the classification ability of unsupervised learning are verified on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10 datasets. The experiments show that our proposed WDIM method is more stable to parameter updates, has faster model convergence, and at the same time, has almost the same accuracy as the DIM method on the classification task of unsupervised learning. Finally, we also propose a reflection of future research for the WDIM method, aiming to provide a research idea and direction for solving the image classification task with unsupervised learning.

Title: Interpretability Is in the Mind of the Beholder: A Causal Framework for Human-Interpretable Representation Learning.
Author: ['Marconato E', 'Passerini A', 'Teso S']
Journal Title: Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 22
Abstract: Research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence has recently started exploring the idea of producing explanations that, rather than being expressed in terms of low-level features, are encoded in terms of interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both post hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in human-interpretable representation learning (hrl) is how to model and operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both post hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of hrl builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us derive a principled notion of alignment between the machine's representation and the vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of representations, namely disentanglement. We also show that alignment is linked to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on human-interpretable representations.
