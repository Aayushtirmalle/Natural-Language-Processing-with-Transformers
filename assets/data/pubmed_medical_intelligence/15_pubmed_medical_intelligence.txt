Abstract: BACKGROUND: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) powered algorithm in clinical decision-making is globally popular among clinicians and medical scientists. In this research endeavor, we harnessed the capabilities of AI to enhance the precision of hysteroscopic myomectomy procedures. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive suite of algorithms, rooted in deep learning technology, addressing myomas segmentation tasks. We assembled a cohort comprising 56 patients diagnosed with submucosal myomas, each of whom underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Subsequently, half of the participants were randomly designated to undergo AI-augmented procedures. Our AI system exhibited remarkable proficiency in elucidating the precise spatial localization of submucosal myomas. RESULTS: The results of our study showcased a statistically significant reduction in both operative duration (41.32 +/- 17.83 minutes vs. 32.11 +/- 11.86 minutes, p=0.03) and intraoperative blood loss (10.00 (6.25-15.00) ml vs. 10.00 (5.00-15.00) ml, p=0.04) in procedures assisted by AI. CONCLUSION: This work stands as a pioneering achievement, marking the inaugural deployment of an AI-powered diagnostic model in the domain of hysteroscopic surgery. Consequently, our findings substantiate the potential of AI-driven interventions within the field of gynecological surgery.

Title: Toward explainable AI (XAI) for mental health detection based on language behavior.
Author: ['Kerz E', 'Zanwar S', 'Qiao Y', 'Wiechmann D']
Journal Title: Frontiers in psychiatry
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular are paving the new way forward for the automated detection and prediction of mental health disorders among the population. Recent research in this area has prioritized predictive accuracy over model interpretability by relying on deep learning methods. However, prioritizing predictive accuracy over model interpretability can result in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which is critical in sensitive applications such as healthcare. There is thus a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and prediction. The main aim of this work is to address a gap by conducting a systematic investigation of XAI approaches in the realm of automatic detection of mental disorders from language behavior leveraging textual data from social media. In pursuit of this aim, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the balance between accuracy and interpretability across predictive mental health models. More specifically, we build BiLSTM models trained on a comprehensive set of human-interpretable features, encompassing syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, readability, cohesion, stylistics, as well as topics and sentiment/emotions derived from lexicon-based dictionaries to capture multiple dimensions of language production. We conduct extensive feature ablation experiments to determine the most informative feature groups associated with specific mental health conditions. We juxtapose the performance of these models against a "black-box" domain-specific pretrained transformer adapted for mental health applications. To enhance the interpretability of the transformers models, we utilize a multi-task fusion learning framework infusing information from two relevant domains (emotion and personality traits). Moreover, we employ two distinct explanation techniques: the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method and a model-specific self-explaining method (AGRAD). These methods allow us to discern the specific categories of words that the information-infused models rely on when generating predictions. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on two public English benchmark datasets, subsuming five mental health conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and psychological stress).

Title: Is recovery just the beginning? Persistent symptoms and health and performance deterioration in post-COVID-19, non-hospitalized university students-a cross-sectional study.
Author: ['Latifi A', 'Flegr J']
Journal Title: Biology methods & protocols
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Many individuals experience persistent symptoms such as deteriorated physical and mental health, increased fatigue, and reduced cognitive performance months after recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is limited data on the long-term trajectory and prevalence of these symptoms, especially in milder cases. Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first 2 years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the 2-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.

Journal Title: Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Achieving endoscopic and histological remission is a critical treatment objective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Nevertheless, interobserver variability can significantly impact overall assessment performance. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm for the real-time and objective evaluation of endoscopic disease activity and prediction of histological remission in UC. DESIGN: This is a retrospective diagnostic study. METHODS: Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using 12,257 endoscopic images and biopsy results sourced from 1124 UC patients who underwent colonoscopy at a single center from January 2018 to December 2022. Mayo Endoscopy Subscore (MES) and UC Endoscopic Index of Severity Score (UCEIS) assessments were conducted by two experienced and independent reviewers. Model performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value. The output of the CNN models was also compared with the corresponding histological results to assess histological remission prediction performance. RESULTS: The MES-CNN model achieved 97.04% accuracy in diagnosing endoscopic remission of UC, while the MES-CNN and UCEIS-CNN models achieved 90.15% and 85.29% accuracy, respectively, in evaluating endoscopic severity of UC. For predicting histological remission, the CNN models achieved accuracy and kappa values of 91.28% and 0.826, respectively, attaining higher accuracy than human endoscopists (87.69%). CONCLUSION: The proposed artificial intelligence model, based on MES and UCEIS evaluations from expert gastroenterologists, offered precise assessment of inflammation in UC endoscopic images and reliably predicted histological remission.

Title: Does artificial intelligence enhance physician interpretation of optical coherence tomography: insights from eye tracking.
Author: ['Cioffi GM', 'Pinilla-Echeverri N', 'Sheth T', 'Sibbald MG']
Journal Title: Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The adoption of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is limited by need for real-time image interpretation expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted Ultreon 2.0 software could address this barrier. We used eye tracking to understand how these software changes impact viewing efficiency and accuracy. METHODS: Eighteen interventional cardiologists and fellows at McMaster University, Canada, were included in the study and categorized as experienced or inexperienced based on lifetime OCT use. They were tasked with reviewing OCT images from both Ultreon 2.0 and AptiVue software platforms while their eye movements were recorded. Key metrics, such as time to first fixation on the area of interest, total task time, dwell time (time spent on the area of interest as a proportion of total task time), and interpretation accuracy, were evaluated using a mixed multivariate model. RESULTS: Physicians exhibited improved viewing efficiency with Ultreon 2.0, characterized by reduced time to first fixation (Ultreon 0.9 s vs. AptiVue 1.6 s, p = 0.007), reduced total task time (Ultreon 10.2 s vs. AptiVue 12.6 s, p = 0.006), and increased dwell time in the area of interest (Ultreon 58% vs. AptiVue 41%, p < 0.001). These effects were similar for experienced and inexperienced physicians. Accuracy of OCT image interpretation was preserved in both groups, with experienced physicians outperforming inexperienced physicians. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that AI-enabled Ultreon 2.0 software can streamline the image interpretation process and improve viewing efficiency for both inexperienced and experienced physicians. Enhanced viewing efficiency implies reduced cognitive load potentially reducing the barriers for OCT adoption in PCI decision-making.

Author: ['Khanna VV', 'Chadaga K', 'Sampathila N', 'Chadaga R', 'Prabhu S', 'K S S', 'Jagdale AS', 'Bhat D']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone condition that occurs when bone mineral density and mass decrease. This makes the bones weak and brittle. The disorder is often undiagnosed and untreated due to its asymptomatic nature until the manifestation of a fracture. Machine Learning (ML) is extensively used in diverse healthcare domains to analyze precise outcomes, provide timely risk scores, and allocate resources. Hence, we have designed multiple heterogeneous machine-learning frameworks to predict the risk of Osteoporosis. An open-source dataset of 1493 patients containing bone density, blood, and physical tests is utilized. Thirteen distinct feature selection techniques were leveraged to extract the most salient parameters. The best-performing pipeline consisted of a Forward Feature Selection algorithm followed by a custom multi-level ensemble learning-based stack, which achieved an accuracy of 89 %. Deploying a layer of explainable artificial intelligence using tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive Values), LIME (Local Interpretable Model Explainer), ELI5, Qlattice, and feature importance provided interpretability and rationale behind classifier prediction. With this study, we aim to provide the holistic risk prediction of Osteoporosis and concurrently present a system for automated screening to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.

Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) via soft computing procedures have attracted the attention of researchers due to their effective modeling, simulation procedures, and detailed analysis. In this article, the designing of intelligence computing through a neural network that is backpropagated with the Levenberg-Marquardt method (NN-BLMM) to study the Cattaneo-Christov heat flow model at the mixed impulse stagnation point (CCHFM-MISP) past a Riga plate is investigated. The original model CCHFM-MISP in terms of PDEs is converted into non-linear ODEs through suitable similarity variables. A data set is generated for all scenarios of CCHFM-MISP through Lobatto IIIA numerical solver by varying Hartman number, velocity ratio parameter, inverse Darcy number, mixed impulse variable, non-dimensional constraint, Eckert number, heat generation variable, Prandtl number, thermal relaxation variable. To find the physical impacts of parameters of interest associated with the presented fluidic system CCHFM-MISP, the approximate solution of NN-BLMM is carried out by performing training (80 %), testing (10 %), and validation (10 %), and then the results are equated with the reference data to ensure the perfection of the proposed model. Through MSE, state transition, error histogram, and regression analysis, the outcomes of NN-BLMM are presented and analyzed. The graphical illustration and numerical outcomes confirm the authentication and effectiveness of the solver. Moreover, mean square errors for validation, training and testing data points along with performance measures lie around 10(-10) and the solution plots generated through deterministic (Lobatto IIIA) approach and stochastic numerical solver are matching up to 10(-6), which surely validate the solver NN-BLMM. The outcomes of M and B on velocity present the similar impacts. The velocity of material particles decreases under Da while, it increases through velocity ratio and magnetic parameters.

Author: ['Patokar A', 'Lohe V', 'Reche A', 'Sune R', 'Datkar D']
Journal Title: Journal of education and health promotion
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Studies on Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) have already focused on various medical aspects of this syndrome. This review is focusing on the psychological aspects of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients, the behaviors of patients, and the effects of the disease on the children. This disorder is characterized by angiomas, glaucoma, and seizures with a birthmark. Patients with this syndrome have behavioral problems, a lack of social skills, and a lack of intellectual or academic skills. These patients are usually introverted because of a lack of warmth and limited communication. Friends or classmates tease them by calling them "ugly." All this leads to a lack of social skills, and they mostly keep their feelings to themselves and prefer to be alone. Because of all this mocking by classmates, they keep isolating themselves. All this causes psychological problems in children. They start behaving differently, have suicidal tendencies, and fight with their friends who bully them. Psychological problems are mostly seen in children who are lacking in intelligence and functioning and who have seizure disorders, mostly in those who have frequent seizures. Problems like anxiety, depression, mood changes, anger, and violence are also observed in these patients. All this is always ignored by the parents as well as the doctors. This review aims to focus on the psychological aspect of the patients with SWS, to inform the parents about the behavior of their children with SWS, and to pay more attention to the psychological problems. This review is focusing on the importance of the psychological behavior of patients with SWS, how to diagnose it at an early stage, and how to treat and take care of children with SWS.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: During the COVID pandemic, it was speculated that patients with the virus who were smoking-related might have a lower likelihood of disease exacerbation or death. To assess whether there is an association between smoking and risk of in-hospital mortality, SAVANA's big data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology is used. METHOD: A retrospective, observational, non-interventional cohort study was conducted based on real-life data extracted from medical records throughout Castilla La Mancha using Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence techniques developed by SAVANA. The study covered the entire population of this region with Electronic Medical Records in SESCAM presenting with a diagnosis of COVID from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. RESULTS: Smokers had a significantly higher percentage of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes), COPD, asthma, IDP, IC, CVD, PTE, cancer in general and lung cancer in particular, bronchiectasis, heart failure and a history of pneumonia (p < 0.0001).Former smokers, current smokers and non-smokers have a significant age difference. As for in-hospital deaths, they were more frequent in the case of ex-smokers, followed by smokers and then non-smokers (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is an increased risk of dying in hospital in SARS-COV2-infected patients who are active smokers or have smoked in the past.

Journal Title: Biological psychiatry. Cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Grey-matter abnormalities in depression are potentially attributable to some combination of trait, state, and illness-history factors. Here, we sought to determine the contributions of polygenic risk for depression, depressive-disease status, and their interaction to these grey-matter abnormalities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional comparison using a 2x3 factorial design examining effects of Polygenic Risk for depression (lower versus upper quartile) and Depression Status (never depressed, currently depressed, or remitted depressed) on regional grey-matter concentration and grey-matter volume. Participants were a subset of MRI-scanned UK Biobank participants comprising 2682 persons (1806 females, 876 males), algorithmically matched on 16 potential confounders. RESULTS: In females but not males we observed that elevated polygenic risk for depression was associated with reduced cerebellar grey-matter volume. This deficit occurred in salience- and dorsal-attention-network regions of the cerebellum and was associated with poorer performance on tests of attention and executive function but not fluid intelligence. Moreover, in currently depressed women, relative both to remitted depressed and never-disordered women, we observed grey-matter reductions in ventral and medial prefrontal, insular, and medial temporal regions. These state-related abnormalities remained when accounting for anti-depressant medication status. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroanatomical deficits attributed broadly to major depression are more likely due to an aggregation of independent factors. Polygenic risk for depression accounts for cerebellar structural abnormalities which, themselves, account for cognitive deficits observed in this disorder. Medial and ventral prefrontal, insular, and temporal cortex deficits constitute a much larger proportion of the aggregate deficit and are attributable to the depressed state.

Abstract: Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host immune response to infection. Despite recognition of its significance, immune status monitoring is not implemented in clinical practice due in part to the current absence of direct therapeutic implications. Technological advances in immunological profiling could enhance our understanding of immune dysregulation and facilitate integration into clinical practice. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of immune profiling in sepsis, including its use, current challenges, and opportunities for progress. We highlight the important role of immunological biomarkers in facilitating predictive enrichment in current and future treatment scenarios. We propose that multiple immune and non-immune-related parameters, including clinical and microbiological data, be integrated into diagnostic and predictive combitypes, with the aid of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. These combitypes could form the basis of workable algorithms to guide clinical decisions that make precision medicine in sepsis a reality and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) images of biopsy needle tract (BNT) tissues for predicting prostate cancer (PCa) and to compare the PCa diagnostic performance of the radiologist model and clinical model. METHODS: A total of 1696 2D prostate TRUS images were involved from 142 patients between July 2021 and May 2022. The ResNet50 network model was utilized to train classification models with different input methods: original image (Whole model), BNT (Needle model), and combined image [Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) model]. The training set, validation set, and test set were randomly assigned, then randomized 5-fold cross-validation between the training set and validation set was performed. The diagnostic effectiveness of AI models and image combination was accessed by an independent testing set. Then, the optimal AI model and image combination were selected to compare the diagnostic efficacy with that of senior radiologists and the clinical model. RESULTS: In the test set, the area under the curve, specificity, and sensitivity of the FPN model were 0.934, 0.966, and 0.829, respectively; the diagnostic efficacy was improved compared with the Whole and Needle models, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05), and was better than that of senior radiologists (area under the curve: 0.667). The FPN model detected more PCa compared with senior physicians (82.9% vs. 55.8%), with a 61.3% decrease in the false-positive rate and a 23.2% increase in overall accuracy (0.887 vs. 0.655). CONCLUSION: The proposed FPN model can offer a new method for prostate tissue classification, improve the diagnostic performance, and may be a helpful tool to guide prostate biopsy.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Real-time artificial intelligence (AI) annotation of the surgical field has the potential to automatically extract information from surgical videos, helping to create a robust surgical atlas. This content can be used for surgical education and qualitative initiatives. We demonstrate the first use of AI in urologic robotic surgery to capture live surgical video and annotate key surgical steps and safety milestones in real-time. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: While AI models possess the capability to generate automated annotations based on a collection of video images, the real-time implementation of such technology in urological robotic surgery to aid surgeon and training staff it is still pending to be studied. METHODS: We conducted an educational symposium, which broadcasted 2 live procedures, a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and a robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). A surgical AI platform system (Theator, Palo Alto, CA) generated real-time annotations and identified operative safety milestones. This was achieved through trained algorithms, conventional video recognition, and novel Video Transfer Network technology which captures clips in full context, enabling automatic recognition and surgical mapping in real-time. RESULTS: Real-time AI annotations for procedure #1, RARP, are found in Table 1. The safety milestone annotations included the apical safety maneuver and deliberate views of structures such as the external iliac vessels and the obturator nerve. Real-time AI annotations for procedure #2, RAPN, are found in Table 1. Safety milestones included deliberate views of structures such as the gonadal vessels and the ureter. AI annotated surgical events included intraoperative ultrasound, temporary clip application and removal, hemostatic powder application, and notable hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, surgical intelligence successfully showcased real-time AI annotations of 2 separate urologic robotic procedures during a live telecast. These annotations may provide the technological framework for send automatic notifications to clinical or operational stakeholders. This technology is a first step in real-time intraoperative decision support, leveraging big data to improve the quality of surgical care, potentially improve surgical outcomes, and support training and education.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computational advances in artificial intelligence have led to the recent emergence of U-Net convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to medical imaging. Our objectives were to assess the progression of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) using routine CT scans processed by a U-Net CNN developed by our research team, and to identify a progression threshold indicative of poor prognosis. METHODS: CT scans and clinical history of 32 patients with idiopathic fibrotic ILDs were retrospectively reviewed. Successive CT scans were processed by the U-Net CNN and ILD quantification was obtained. Correlation between ILD and FVC changes was assessed. ROC curve was used to define a threshold of ILD progression rate (PR) to predict poor prognostic (mortality or lung transplantation). The PR threshold was used to compare the cohort survival with Kaplan Mayer curves and log-rank test. RESULTS: The follow-up was 3.8 +/- 1.5 years encompassing 105 CT scans, with 3.3 +/- 1.1 CT scans per patient. A significant correlation between ILD and FVC changes was obtained (p = 0.004, rho = -0.30 [95% CI: -0.16 to -0.45]). Sixteen patients (50%) experienced unfavorable outcome including 13 deaths and 3 lung transplantations. ROC curve analysis showed an aera under curve of 0.83 (p < 0.001), with an optimal cut-off PR value of 4%/year. Patients exhibiting a PR >/= 4%/year during the first two years had a poorer prognosis (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Applying a U-Net CNN to routine CT scan allowed identifying patients with a rapid progression and unfavorable outcome.

Abstract: Patient care workflows are highly multimodal and intertwined: the intersection of data outputs provided from different disciplines and in different formats remains one of the main challenges of modern oncology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the current clinical practice of oncology owing to advancements in digitalization, database expansion, computational technologies, and algorithmic innovations that facilitate discernment of complex relationships in multimodal data. Within oncology, radiation therapy (RT) represents an increasingly complex working procedure, involving many labor-intensive and operator-dependent tasks. In this context, AI has gained momentum as a powerful tool to standardize treatment performance and reduce inter-observer variability in a time-efficient manner. This review explores the hurdles associated with the development, implementation, and maintenance of AI platforms and highlights current measures in place to address them. In examining AI's role in oncology workflows, we underscore that a thorough and critical consideration of these challenges is the only way to ensure equitable and unbiased care delivery, ultimately serving patients' survival and quality of life.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 22
Abstract: Clinical dermatoscopy and pathological slide assessment are essential in the diagnosis and management of patients with cutaneous melanoma. For those presenting with stage IIC disease and beyond, radiological investigations are often considered. The dermatoscopic, whole slide and radiological images used during clinical care are often stored digitally, enabling artificial intelligence (AI) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn, analyse and contribute to the clinical decision-making. To review the literature on the progression, capabilities and limitations of AI and CNN and its use in diagnosis and management of cutaneous melanoma. A keyword search of the Medline database for articles relating to cutaneous melanoma. Full-text articles were reviewed if they related to dermatoscopy, pathological slide assessment or radiology. Through analysis of 95 studies, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy of AI/CNN can be superior (or at least equal) to clinicians. However, variability in image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction remains challenging. With current technological abilities, AI/CNN and clinicians synergistically working together are better than one another in all subspecialty domains relating to cutaneous melanoma. AI has the potential to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of junior dermatology trainees, primary care skin cancer clinicians and general practitioners. For experienced clinicians, AI provides a cost-efficient second opinion. From a pathological and radiological perspective, CNN has the potential to improve workflow efficiency, allowing clinicians to achieve more in a finite amount of time. Until the challenges of AI/CNN are reliably met, however, they can only remain an adjunct to clinical decision-making.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 23
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predictive toxicology is rapidly increasing, particularly aiming to develop non-testing methods that effectively address ethical concerns and reduce economic costs. In this context, Developmental Toxicity (Dev Tox) stands as a key human health endpoint, especially significant for safeguarding maternal and child well-being. AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the existing methods employed in Dev Tox predictions and underscores the benefits of utilizing New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), specifically focusing on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which proves highly efficient in constructing reliable and transparent models aligned with recommendations from international regulatory bodies. EXPERT OPINION: The limited availability of high-quality data and the absence of dependable Dev Tox methodologies render XAI an appealing avenue for systematically developing interpretable and transparent models, which hold immense potential for both scientific evaluations and regulatory decision-making.
