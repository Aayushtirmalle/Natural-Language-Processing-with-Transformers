Abstract: The development of accurate and interpretable models for predicting reaction constants of organic compounds with hydroxyl radicals is vital for advancing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in pollutant degradation. Methods like molecular descriptors, molecular fingerprinting, and group contribution methods have limitations, as traditional machine learning struggles to capture all intramolecular information simultaneously. To address this, we established an integrated graph neural network (GNN) with approximately 12 million learnable parameters. GNN represents atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges, thus transforming molecules into a graph structures, effectively capturing microscopic properties while depicting atom connectivity in non-Euclidean space. Our datasets comprise 1401 pollutants to develop an integrated GNN model with Bayesian optimization, the model achieves root mean square errors of 0.165, 0.172, and 0.189 on the training, validation, and test datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we assess molecular structure similarity using molecular fingerprint to enhance the model's applicability. Afterwards, we propose a gradient weight mapping method for model explainability, uncovering the key functional groups in chemical reactions in artificial intelligence perspective, which would boost chemistry through artificial intelligence extreme arithmetic power.

Journal Title: Frontiers in medicine
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the value of an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostic system in the prediction of pulmonary nodules. METHODS: The AI system was able to make predictions of benign or malignant nodules. 260 cases of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) were divided into 173 malignant cases and 87 benign cases based on the surgical pathological diagnosis. A stratified data analysis was applied to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of the AI system to distinguish between the subgroups with different clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The accuracy of AI system in judging benignity and malignancy of the nodules was 75.77% (p < 0.05). We created an ROC curve by calculating the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold values, and the AUC was 0.755. Results of the stratified analysis were as follows. (1) By nodule position: the AUC was 0.677, 0.758, 0.744, 0.982, and 0.725, respectively, for the nodules in the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. (2) By nodule size: the AUC was 0.778, 0.771, and 0.686, respectively, for the nodules measuring 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 mm in diameter. (3) The predictive accuracy was higher for the subsolid pulmonary nodules than for the solid ones (80.54 vs. 66.67%). CONCLUSION: The AI system can be applied to assist in the prediction of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. It can provide a valuable reference, especially for the diagnosis of subsolid nodules and small nodules measuring 5-10 mm in diameter.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The development of costs-effective and sensitive screening solutions to prevent amblyopia and identify its risk factors (strabismus, refractive problems or mixed) is a significant priority of pediatric ophthalmology. The main objective of our study was to compare the classification performance of various vision screening tests, including classic, stereoacuity-based tests (Lang II, TNO, Stereo Fly, and Frisby), and non-stereoacuity-based, low-density static, dynamic, and noisy anaglyphic random dot stereograms. We determined whether the combination of non-stereoacuity-based tests integrated in the simplest artificial intelligence (AI) model could be an alternative method for vision screening. METHODS: Our study, conducted in Spain and Hungary, is a non-experimental, cross-sectional diagnostic test assessment focused on pediatric eye conditions. Using convenience sampling, we enrolled 423 children aged 3.6-14 years, diagnosed with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors, and compared them to age-matched emmetropic controls. Comprehensive pediatric ophthalmologic examinations ascertained diagnoses. Participants used filter glasses for stereovision tests and red-green goggles for an AI-based test over their prescribed glasses. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were our metrics, with sensitivity being the primary endpoint. AUCs were analyzed using DeLong's method, and binary classifications (pathologic vs. normal) were evaluated using McNemar's matched pair and Fisher's nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Four non-overlapping groups were studied: (1) amblyopia (n = 46), (2) amblyogenic (n = 55), (3) non-amblyogenic (n = 128), and (4) emmetropic (n = 194), and a fifth group that was a combination of the amblyopia and amblyogenic groups. Based on AUCs, the AI combination of non-stereoacuity-based tests showed significantly better performance 0.908, 95% CI: (0.829-0.958) for detecting amblyopia and its risk factors than most classical tests: Lang II: 0.704, (0.648-0.755), Stereo Fly: 0.780, (0.714-0.837), Frisby: 0.754 (0.688-0.812), p < 0.02, n = 91, DeLong's method). At the optimum ROC point, McNemar's test indicated significantly higher sensitivity in accord with AUCs. Moreover, the AI solution had significantly higher sensitivity than TNO (p = 0.046, N = 134, Fisher's test), as well, while the specificity did not differ. DISCUSSION: The combination of multiple tests utilizing anaglyphic random dot stereograms with varying parameters (density, noise, dynamism) in AI leads to the most advanced and sensitive screening test for identifying amblyopia and amblyogenic conditions compared to all the other tests studied.

Author: ['Dutta S', 'Mudaranthakam DP', 'Li Y', 'Sardiu ME']
Journal Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
Publication Date: 2023 Oct 30
Abstract: Omics datasets often pose a computational challenge due to their high dimensionality, large size, and non-linear structures. Analyzing these datasets becomes especially daunting in the presence of rare events. Machine learning (ML) methods have gained traction for analyzing rare events, yet there remains a limited exploration of bioinformatics tools that integrate ML techniques to comprehend the underlying biology. Expanding upon our previously developed computational framework of an integrative machine learning approach (1) , we introduce PerSEveML, an interactive web-based that uses crowd-sourced intelligence to predict rare events and determine feature selection structures. PerSEveML provides a comprehensive overview of the integrative approach through evaluation metrics that help users understand the contribution of individual ML methods to the prediction process. Additionally, PerSEveML calculates entropy and rank scores, which visually organize input features into a persistent structure of selected, unselected, and fluctuating categories that help researchers uncover meaningful hypotheses regarding the underlying biology. We have evaluated PerSEveML on three diverse biologically complex data sets with extremely rare events from small to large scale and have demonstrated its ability to generate valid hypotheses. PerSEveML is available at https://biostats-shinyr.kumc.edu/PerSEveML/ and https://github.com/sreejatadutta/PerSEveML .

Journal Title: Prostate international
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our life, including the medical field. Repeated machine learning using big data made various fields more predictable and accurate. In medicine, IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), trained by Memorial Slone Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), was first introduced and applied in 14 countries worldwide.Our study was designed to assess the feasibility of WFO in actual clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the concordance rate between WFO and multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) in Urologic cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively collected data for consecutive patients who underwent WFO and MTB simultaneously in the diagnosis of urologic malignancy before determining further treatment between August 2017 and September 2020. We compared the recommendation of the AI system, WFO (IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA), with the opinion of MTB for further managing all patients diagnosed with urologic malignancies such as prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled in our study. The number of patients with prostate cancer was 48. The number of bladder and kidney cancer patients was 5 and 2, respectively. The overall concordance rate between WFO and MTB was 92.7%. Three patients could not suggest proper treatment options using WFO, and the recommended choice of WFO was not feasible in the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. CONCLUSIONS: The decision of WFO showed a high concordance rate with a multidisciplinary tumor board for urologic oncology. However, some recommendations of WFO were not feasible in actual practice, and WFO still has some points to improve and modify. Interestingly, applying WFO is likely to facilitate a multidisciplinary team approach.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 20
Abstract: Pneumoconiosis is the occupational disease with the highest burden in China currently. The diagnosis of pneumoconiosis mainly relies on manual reading of X-ray high-kilovoltage or digital photography chest radiograph, which has some problems such as low efficiency, strong subjectivity, and cannot accurately judge the critical lesions. With the progress of machine-aided diagnosis technology, the efficient, objective and quantitative of artificial intelligence diagnosis technology just solve the shortcomings above. This paper reviews the research progress in digital chest radiography diagnosis of pneumoconiosis using artificial intelligence technology, especially deep learning model, combined with the limitations of conventional manual reading, in order to clarify the application prospect of artificial intelligence technology in the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis by digital chest radiography, and provide a direction for future research in this field.

Journal Title: Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 12
Abstract: We investigate the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI, in providing nutritional information for dietary planning and weight management. The results have a reasonable level of accuracy, with energy values having the highest level of conformity: 97% of the artificial intelligence values fall within a 40% difference from United States Department of Agriculture data. Additionally, ChatGPT displayed consistency in its provision of nutritional data, as indicated by relatively low coefficient of variation values for each nutrient. The artificial intelligence model also proved efficient in generating a daily meal plan within a specified caloric limit, with all the meals falling within a 30% bound of the United States Department of Agriculture's caloric values. These findings suggest that ChatGPT can provide reasonably accurate and consistent nutritional information. Further research is recommended to assess the model's performance across a broader range of foods and meals.<END ABSTRACT>.

Abstract: Breast cancer has the highest incidence and second-highest mortality rate among all cancers. The management of breast cancer is being revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI), which is improving early detection, pathological diagnosis, risk assessment, individualized treatment recommendations, and treatment response prediction. Nuclear medicine has used artificial intelligence (AI) for over 50 years, but more recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have given AI in nuclear medicine additional capabilities. AI accurately analyzes breast imaging scans for early detection, minimizing false negatives while offering radiologists reliable, swift image processing assistance. It smoothly fits into radiology workflows, which may result in early treatments and reduced expenditures. In pathological diagnosis, artificial intelligence improves the quality of diagnostic data by ensuring accurate diagnoses, lowering inter-observer variability, speeding up the review process, and identifying errors or poor slides. By taking into consideration nutritional, genetic, and environmental factors, providing individualized risk assessments, and recommending more regular tests for higher-risk patients, AI aids with the risk assessment of breast cancer. The integration of clinical and genetic data into individualized treatment recommendations by AI facilitates collaborative decision-making and resource allocation optimization while also enabling patient progress monitoring, drug interaction consideration, and alignment with clinical guidelines. AI is used to analyze patient data, imaging, genomic data, and pathology reports in order to forecast how a treatment would respond. These models anticipate treatment outcomes, make sure that clinical recommendations are followed, and learn from historical data. The implementation of AI in medicine is hampered by issues with data quality, integration with healthcare IT systems, data protection, bias reduction, and ethical considerations, necessitating transparency and constant surveillance. Protecting patient privacy, resolving biases, maintaining transparency, identifying fault for mistakes, and ensuring fair access are just a few examples of ethical considerations. To preserve patient trust and address the effect on the healthcare workforce, ethical frameworks must be developed. The amazing potential of AI in the treatment of breast cancer calls for careful examination of its ethical and practical implications. We aim to review the comprehensive role of artificial intelligence in breast cancer management.

Title: A novel approach for sports injury risk prediction: based on time-series image encoding and deep learning.
Author: ['Ye X', 'Huang Y', 'Bai Z', 'Wang Y']
Journal Title: Frontiers in physiology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The rapid development of big data technology and artificial intelligence has provided a new perspective on sports injury prevention. Although data-driven algorithms have achieved some valuable results in the field of sports injury risk assessment, the lack of sufficient generalization of models and the inability to automate feature extraction have made it challenging to deploy research results in the real world. Therefore, this study attempts to build an injury risk prediction model using a combination of time-series image encoding and deep learning algorithms to address this issue better. This study used the time-series image encoding approach for feature construction to represent relationships between values at different moments, including Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plot (RP). Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DCAE) learned the image-encoded data for representation to obtain features with good discrimination, and the classifier was performed using Deep Neural Network (DNN). The results from five repeated experiments show that the GASF-DCAE-DNN model is overall better in the training (AUC: 0.985 +/- 0.001, Gmean: 0.930 +/- 0.007, Sensitivity: 0.997 +/- 0.003, Specificity: 0.868 +/- 0.013) and test sets (AUC: 0.891 +/- 0.026, Gmean: 0.830 +/- 0.027, Sensitivity: 0.816 +/- 0.039, Specificity: 0.845 +/- 0.022), with good discriminative power, robustness, and generalization ability. Compared with the best model reported in the literature, the AUC, Gmean, Sensitivity, and Specificity of the GASF-DCAE-DNN model were higher by 23.9%, 27.5%, 39.7%, and 16.2%, respectively, which confirmed the validity and practicability of the model in injury risk prediction. In addition, differences in injury risk patterns between the training and test sets were identified through shapley additivity interpretation. It was also found that the training volume was an essential factor that affected injury risk prediction. The model proposed in this study provides a powerful injury risk prediction tool for future sports injury prevention practice.

Journal Title: Italian journal of food safety
Publication Date: 2023 Nov 9
Abstract: Trichinellosis is a globally diffused foodborne parasitic disease caused by nematodes of the Trichinella complex. During evolution, guided by ecological interactions, natural selection, and biochemical "intelligence", these parasites developed admirable strategies to infect the host's organism. One of the most fascinating is represented by the nurse cell formation in muscular tissue (e.g., diaphragm, skeletal muscle, extrinsic ocular muscles, etc.). This strategy allowed the parasite to adapt and conquer the wider host species spectrum, including ungulates and humans. Consumption of undercooked meat from infected wild ungulates constitutes the most important source of infection for the human species. In this study, we show the prevalence of Trichinella spp. in hunted wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Central Italy. During the hunting season 2021/2022 in the province of Rieti, 554 wild boar diaphragm biopsies were collected for Trichinella spp. screening, in accordance with Regulation EU 1375/2015. An artificial digestion method was used for the detection of Trichinella spp. larval forms. The results revealed a positivity of 0.18% (1/554), and molecular biology identification demonstrated the presence of Trichinella britovi in the positive sample. This species is the most diffused in wild ungulate populations in Central Italy and the most frequently isolated in human patients with trichinellosis from this area, showing a close epidemiological relation between Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa for Trichinella spp. diffusion in an ecosystem. Epidemiological surveillance, in receptive animal species destined for human consumption and at any One Health level, represents the main "winning" strategy in the control of this worldwide, widespread foodborne parasitic disease.

Title: Enhancing public sector enterprise risk management through interactive information processing.
Author: ['Andersen TJ', 'Young PC']
Journal Title: Frontiers in research metrics and analytics
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Federal agencies are increasingly expected to adopt enterprise risk management (ERM). However, public sector adoption of ERM has typically focused on the economic efficiency of tax-financed activities based on control-based practices. This reflects an emphasis on quantifiable concerns that invariably directs attention to risk, that (by definition) relates to identifiable and measurable events, thereby downplaying uncertain and unknown aspects of public exposures. This is a potentially serious shortcoming as government entities often act as society's risk managers of last resort. When extreme events happen what were previously considered private matters can quickly turn into public obligations. Hence, there is a need for proactive assessments of the evolving public risk landscape to discern unpredictable-even unknowable-developments. METHODS: The article reviews recent empirical studies on public risk management practices, effects of digitalization in public sector institutions, current strategic management research, and insights uncovered from a recent study of risk management practices in federal agencies. On this basis, the article explains how the ability to generate value from ERM can be enhanced when it intertwines with local responsive initiatives and central strategic risk analyses. It can form a dynamic adaptive risk management process where insights from dispersed actors inform updated risk analyses based on local autonomy and open exchange of information. This approach builds on specific structural features embedded in culture-driven aspirations to generate collaborative solutions. Its functional mode is an interactive control system with open discussions across levels and functions in contrast to conventional diagnostic controls that monitor predetermined key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs). FINDINGS: Backed by theoretical rationales and empirical research evidence, it is found that applications of ERM frameworks can produce positive results but is unable to deal with a public risk landscape characterized by uncertain unpredictable conditions with potentially extreme outcome effects. It is shown how interactive exchange of fast local insights and slow integrated strategic risk analyses supported by digitized data processing can form a dynamic adaptive system that enable public sector institutions to deal with emergent high-scale exposures. It is explained how the requirement for conducive organizational structures and supportive values require a new strategic risk leadership approach, which is contrasted to observed practices in federal agencies that are constrained by prevailing public governance requirements. DISCUSSION: The need to deal with uncertainty and unknown conditions demands a cognitive shift in current thinking from a primary focus on risk to also appraise complexity and prepare for the unexpected where data-driven methods can uncover emergent exposures through dynamic information processing. This requires strategic risk leaders that recognize the significance of complex public exposures with many unknowns and a willingness to facilitate digitalized information processing rooted in a collaborative organizational climate. If handled properly, adoption of ERM in public risk management can consider emergent dimensions in complex public exposures applying interactive information processing as a dynamic adaptive risk management approach incorporating digitized methods to solicit collective intelligence for strategic risk updating.

Author: ['Alabadi M', 'Habbal A']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The fourth industrial revolution, often referred to as Industry 4.0, has revolutionized the manufacturing sector by integrating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine and deep learning, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud computing, cyber physical systems (CPSs) and cognitive computing, throughout the production life cycle. Predictive maintenance (PdM) emerges as a critical component, utilizing data analytic to track machine health and proactively detect machinery failures. Deep learning (DL), is pivotal in this context, offering superior accuracy in prediction through neural networks' data processing capabilities. However, DL adoption in PdM faces challenges, including continuous model updates and domain dependence. Meanwhile, centralized DL models, prevalent in PdM, pose security risks such as central points of failure and unauthorized access. To address these issues, this study presents an innovative decentralized PdM system integrating DL, blockchain, and decentralized storage based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for accurately predicting Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL). DL handles predictive tasks, while blockchain secures data orchestration. Decentralized storage safeguards model metadata and training data for dynamic models. The system features synchronized two DL pipelines for time series data, encompassing prediction and training mechanisms. The detailed material and methods of this research shed light on the system's development and validation processes. Rigorous validation confirms the system's accuracy, performance, and security through an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate the system's dynamic updating and domain independence. Prediction model surpass state-of-the-art models in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) score. Blockchain-based scalability performance was tested based on smart contract gas usage, and the analysis shows efficient performance across varying input and output data scales. A comprehensive CIA analysis highlights the system's robust security features, addressing confidentiality, integrity, and availability aspects. The proposed decentralized predictive maintenance (PdM) system, which incorporates deep learning (DL), blockchain technology, and decentralized storage, has the potential to improve predictive accuracy and overcome significant security and scalability obstacles. Consequently, this system holds promising implications for the advancement of predictive maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0.

Title: FMC(2) model based perception grading for dark insurgent network analysis.
Author: ['Pugalendhi GK', 'Kumaresan S', 'Paul A']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The burgeoning role of social network analysis (SNA) in various fields raises complex challenges, particularly in the analysis of dark and dim networks involved in illicit activities. Existing models like the stochastic block model (SBM), exponential graph model (EGM), and latent space model (LSM) are limited in scope, often only suitable for one-mode networks. This article introduces a novel fuzzy multiple criteria multiple constraint model (FMC(2)) tailored for community detection in two-mode networks, which are particularly common in dark networks. The proposed method quantitatively determines the relationships between nodes based on a probabilistic measure and uses distance metrics to identify communities within the network. Moreover, the model establishes fuzzy boundaries to differentiate between the most and least influential nodes. We validate the efficacy of FMC2 using the Noordin Terrorist dataset and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate performance metrics. The results demonstrate that FMC2 not only effectively identifies communities but also ranks influential nodes within them, contributing to a nuanced understanding of complex networks. The method promises broad applicability and adaptability, particularly in intelligence and security domains where identifying influential actors within covert networks is critical.

Title: Research on line loss analysis and intelligent diagnosis of abnormal causes in distribution networks: artificial intelligence based method.
Author: ['Liao Y', 'En W', 'Li B', 'Zhu M', 'Li B', 'Li Z', 'Gu Z']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The primary source of energy losses in distribution networks (DNs) is rooted in line losses, which is crucial to conduct a thorough and reasonable examination of any unusual sources of line losses to guarantee the power supply in a timely and safe manner. In recent studies, identifying and analyzing abnormal line losses in DNs has been a widely and challenging research subject. This article investigates a key technology for the line loss analyses of DNs and intelligent diagnosis of abnormal causes by implementing artificial intelligence (AI), resulting in several prominent results. The proposed algorithm optimizes the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) and suggests an intelligent diagnosis algorithm called the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm and Support Vector Machine (ISSA-SVM). The ISSA-SVM algorithm is trained to calculate the data anomalies of line losses when changing loads and exhibiting exceptional performance to identify abnormal line losses. The accuracy of abnormality identification employing the ISSA-SVM algorithm reaches an impressive 98%, surpassing the performances of other available algorithms. Moreover, the practical performance of the proposed approach for analyzing large volumes of abnormal line loss data daily in DNs is also noteworthy. The ISSA-SVM accurately identifies the root causes of abnormal line losses and lowers the error in calculating abnormal line loss data. By combining different types of power operation data and creating a multidimensional feature traceability model, the study successfully determines the factors contributing to abnormal line losses. The relationship between transformers and voltage among various lines is determined by using the Pearson correlation, which provides valuable insights into the relationship between these variables and line losses. The algorithm's reliability and its potential to be applied to real-world scenarios bring an opportunity to improve the efficiency and safety of power supply systems. The ISSA that incorporates advanced techniques such as the Sobol sequence, golden sine algorithm, and Gaussian difference mutation appears to be a promising tool.

Title: Computational linguistics based text emotion analysis using enhanced beetle antenna search with deep learning during COVID-19 pandemic.
Author: ['Alotaibi Y', 'Selvi Sundarapandi AM', 'P S', 'Rajendran S']
Journal Title: PeerJ. Computer science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Computational intelligence and nature-inspired computing have changed the way biologically and linguistically driven computing paradigms are made. In the last few decades, they have been used more and more to solve optimisation problems in the real world. Computational linguistics has its roots in linguistics, but most of the studies being done today are led by computer scientists. Data-driven and machine-learning methods have become more popular than handwritten language rules, which shows this shift. This study uses a new method called Computational Linguistics-based mood Analysis using Enhanced Beetle Antenna Search with deep learning (CLSA-EBASDL) to tackle the important problem of mood analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine how people felt about the COVID-19 pandemic by studying social media texts. The method is made up of three main steps. First, data pre-processing changes raw data into a shape that can be used. After that, word embedding is done using the 'bi-directional encoder representations of transformers (BERT) process. An attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (ABiLSTM) network is at the heart of mood classification. The Enhanced Beetle Antenna Search (EBAS) method, in particular, fine-tunes hyperparameters so that the ABiLSTM model works at its best. Many tests show that the CLSA-EBASDL method works better than others. Comparative studies show that it works, making it the best method for analysing opinion during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In many cases, it is hard to emphasize the importance of monitoring things in real-time with data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The people who make the IoT devices and those who use them face big problems when they try to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in real-world applications, where data must be collected and processed at a central location. Federated learning (FL) has made a decentralized, cooperative AI system that can be used by many IoT apps that use AI. It is possible because it can train AI on IoT devices that are spread out and do not need to share data. FL allows local models to be trained on local data and share their knowledge to improve a global model. Also, shared learning allows models from all over the world to be trained using data from all over the world. This article looks at the IoT in all of its forms, including "smart" businesses, "smart" cities, "smart" transportation, and "smart" healthcare. This study looks at the safety problems that the federated learning with IoT (FL-IoT) area has brought to market. This research is needed to explore because federated learning is a new technique, and a small amount of work is done on challenges faced during integration with IoT. This research also helps in the real world in such applications where encrypted data must be sent from one place to another. Researchers and graduate students are the audience of our article.

Abstract: Recently, attention mechanism and derived models have gained significant traction in drug development due to their outstanding performance and interpretability in handling complex data structures. This review offers an in-depth exploration of the principles underlying attention-based models and their advantages in drug discovery. We further elaborate on their applications in various aspects of drug development, from molecular screening and target binding to property prediction and molecule generation. Finally, we discuss the current challenges faced in the application of attention mechanisms and Artificial Intelligence technologies, including data quality, model interpretability and computational resource constraints, along with future directions for research. Given the accelerating pace of technological advancement, we believe that attention-based models will have an increasingly prominent role in future drug discovery. We anticipate that these models will usher in revolutionary breakthroughs in the pharmaceutical domain, significantly accelerating the pace of drug development.
