Abstract: AIM: This study aims to explore the critical dimension of assessing the perceptions and readiness of hematologists to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in their diagnostic and treatment decision-making processes. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design for collecting data related to the perceptions and readiness of hematologists using a validated online questionnaire-based survey. Both hematologists (MD) and postgraduate MD students in hematology were included in the study. A total of 188 participants, including 35 hematologists (MD) and 153 MD hematology students, completed the survey. RESULTS: Major challenges include "AI's level of autonomy" and "the complexity in the field of medicine." Major barriers and risks identified include "lack of trust," "management's level of understanding," "dehumanization of healthcare," and "reduction in physicians' skills." Statistically significant differences in perceptions of benefits including resources (p=0.0326, p<0.05) and knowledge (p=0.0262, p<0.05) were observed between genders. Older physicians were observed to be more concerned about the use of AI compared to younger physicians (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: While AI use in hematology diagnosis and treatment decision-making is positively perceived, issues such as lack of trust, transparency, regulations, and poor AI awareness can affect the adoption of AI.

Title: Bidirectional associations between hearing difficulty and cognitive function in Chinese adults: a longitudinal study.

Journal Title: Frontiers in aging neuroscience
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Middle-aged and older adults frequently experience hearing loss and a decline in cognitive function. Although an association between hearing difficulty and cognitive function has been demonstrated, its temporal sequence remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether there are bidirectional relationships between hearing difficulty and cognitive function and explored the mediating role of depressive symptoms in this relationship. METHOD: We used the cross-lagged panel model and the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model to look for any possible two-way link between self-reported hearing difficulty and cognitive function. To investigate depressive symptoms' role in this association, a mediation analysis was conducted. The sample was made up of 4,363 adults aged 45 and above from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; 2011-2018; 44.83% were women; mean age was 56.16 years). One question was used to determine whether someone had a hearing impairment. The tests of cognitive function included episodic memory and intelligence. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which consists of 10 items, was used to measure depressive symptoms. RESULTS: A bidirectional association between hearing and cognition was observed, with cognition predominating (Wald chi2 (1) = 7.241, p < 0.01). At the between-person level, after controlling for potential confounders, worse hearing in 2011 predicted worse cognitive function in 2013 (beta = -0.039, p < 0.01) and vice versa (beta = -0.041, p < 0.01) at the between-person level. Additionally, there was no corresponding cross-lagged effect of cognitive function on hearing difficulty; rather, the more hearing difficulty, the greater the cognitive decline at the within-person level. According to the cross-lagged mediation model, depressive symptoms partially mediates the impact of cognitive function on subsequent hearing difficulty (indirect effect: -0.003, bootstrap 95% confidence interval: -0.005, -0.001, p < 0.05), but not the other way around. CONCLUSION: These results showed that within-person relationships between hearing impairment and cognitive function were unidirectional, while between-person relationships were reciprocal. Setting mental health first may be able to break the vicious cycle that relates hearing loss to cognitive decline. Comprehensive long-term care requires services that address depressive symptoms and cognitive decline to be integrated with the hearing management.

Title: Mitigating Membership Inference in Deep Survival Analyses with Differential Privacy.
Author: ['Fan L', 'Bonomi L']
Journal Title: IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics. IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics
Publication Date: 2023 Jun
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been increasingly integrated in healthcare applications to enable accurate predicative analyses. Sharing trained deep models not only facilitates knowledge integration in collaborative research efforts but also enables equitable access to computational intelligence. However, recent studies have shown that an adversary may leverage a shared model to learn the participation of a target individual in the training set. In this work, we investigate privacy-protecting model sharing for survival studies. Specifically, we pose three research questions. (1) Do deep survival models leak membership information? (2) How effective is differential privacy in defending against membership inference in deep survival analyses? (3) Are there other effects of differential privacy on deep survival analyses? Our study assesses the membership leakage in emerging deep survival models and develops differentially private training procedures to provide rigorous privacy protection. The experimental results show that deep survival models leak membership information and our approach effectively reduces membership inference risks. The results also show that differential privacy introduces a limited performance loss, and may improve the model robustness in the presence of noisy data, compared to non-private models.

Title: Emergence Patterns from General Anesthesia after Epilepsy Surgery: An Observational Pilot Study.
Author: ['Venkatraghavan L', 'Bhardwaj S', 'Banik S', 'Chowdhury T', 'McAndrews MP', 'Valiante T']
Journal Title: Asian journal of neurosurgery
Publication Date: 2023 Sep
Abstract: Objective Emergence from anesthesia starts from the limbic structures and then spreads outwards to brainstem, reticular activating systems, and then to the cortex. Epilepsy surgery often involves resection of limbic structures and hence may disrupt the pattern of emergence. The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of emergence from anesthesia following epilepsy surgery and to determine associated variables affecting the emergence pattern. Setting and Design  Tertiary care center, prospective observational study. Materials   and Methods We conducted a prospective observation pilot study on adult patients undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy for epilepsy. Anesthesia management was standardized in all patients, and they were allowed to wake up with "no touch" technique. Primary outcome of the study was the pattern of emergence (normal emergence, agitated emergence, or slow emergence) from anesthesia. Secondary outcomes were to explore the differences in preoperative neuropsychological profile and limbic structure volumes between the different patterns of emergence. Quantitative variables were analyzed using Student's t -test. Qualitative variables were analyzed using chi-square test. Results  Twenty-nine patients completed the study: 9 patients (31%) had agitated emergence, and 20 patients had normal emergence. Among the agitated emergence, 2 patients had Riker scale of 7 indicating violent emergence. Patient demographics, anesthetic used, neuropsychological profile, and limbic structure volumes were similar between normal emergence and agitated emergence groups. However, two patients who had severe agitation (Riker scale of 7) had the lowest intelligence quotient. Conclusion  Our pilot study showed that emergence agitation is not uncommon in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. However, due to smaller sample size, the role of preoperative neuropsychologic profile and hippocampal volumes in predicting the pattern of emergence is inconclusive.

Author: ['Bednorz A', 'Mak JKL', 'Jylhava J', 'Religa D']
Journal Title: Clinical interventions in aging
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Electronic medical records (EMRs) have many benefits in clinical research in gerontology, enabling data analysis, development of prognostic tools and disease risk prediction. EMRs also offer a range of advantages in clinical practice, such as comprehensive medical records, streamlined communication with healthcare providers, remote data access, and rapid retrieval of test results, ultimately leading to increased efficiency, enhanced patient safety, and improved quality of care in gerontology, which includes benefits like reduced medication use and better patient history taking and physical examination assessments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches on EMRs can further improve disease diagnosis, symptom classification, and support clinical decision-making. However, there are also challenges related to data quality, data entry errors, as well as the ethics and safety of using AI in healthcare. This article discusses the future of EMRs in gerontology and the application of AI and ML in clinical research. Ethical and legal issues surrounding data sharing and the need for healthcare professionals to critically evaluate and integrate these technologies are also emphasized. The article concludes by discussing the challenges related to the use of EMRs in research as well as in their primary intended use, the daily clinical practice.

Abstract: Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is a type of psychological visual stimulation experimental paradigm that requires participants to identify target stimuli presented continuously in a stream of stimuli composed of numbers, letters, words, images, and so on at the same spatial location, allowing them to discern a large amount of information in a short period of time. The RSVP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can not only be widely used in scenarios such as assistive interaction and information reading, but also has the advantages of stability and high efficiency, which has become one of the common techniques for human-machine intelligence fusion. In recent years, brain-controlled spellers, image recognition and mind games are the most popular fields of RSVP-BCI research. Therefore, aiming to provide reference and new ideas for RSVP-BCI related research, this paper reviewed the paradigm design and system performance optimization of RSVP-BCI in these three fields. It also looks ahead to its potential applications in cutting-edge fields such as entertainment, clinical medicine, and special military operations.

Abstract: This review article aims to explore the major challenges that the healthcare system is currently facing and propose a new paradigm shift that harnesses the potential of wearable devices and novel theoretical frameworks on health and disease. Lifestyle-induced diseases currently account for a significant portion of all healthcare spending, with this proportion projected to increase with population aging. Wearable devices have emerged as a key technology for implementing large-scale healthcare systems focused on disease prevention and management. Advancements in miniaturized sensors, system integration, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies have enabled wearable devices to perform high-quality measurements comparable to medical devices. Through various physical, chemical, and biological sensors, wearable devices can continuously monitor physiological status information in a non-invasive or minimally invasive way, including electrocardiography, electroencephalography, respiration, blood oxygen, blood pressure, blood glucose, activity, and more. Furthermore, by combining concepts and methods from complex systems and nonlinear dynamics, we developed a novel theory of continuous dynamic physiological signal analysis-dynamical complexity. The results of dynamic signal analyses can provide crucial information for disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. Wearable devices can also serve as an important bridge connecting doctors and patients by tracking, storing, and sharing patient data with medical institutions, enabling remote or real-time health assessments of patients, and providing a basis for precision medicine and personalized treatment. Wearable devices have a promising future in the healthcare field and will be an important driving force for the transformation of the healthcare system, while also improving the health experience for individuals.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess 6 generative artificial intelligences (AIs)' performance on the learning objectives of medical arthropodology in parasitology class in Korea. We examined AIs' performance by querying in Korean and English to determine their information amount, accuracy, and relevance in both language prompts. METHODS: From December 15 to 17, 2023, 6 generative AIs, including Bard, Bing, Claude, Clova X, GPT-4, and Wrtn, were tested on 7 medical arthropodology learning objectives in English and Korean. Clova X and Wrtn are platforms from Korean companies. Responses were evaluated for the criteria in English and Korean queries. RESULTS: Bard had abundant information but was fourth in accuracy and relevance. GPT-4, with high information content, ranked first in accuracy and relevance. Clova X was 4th in amount but 2nd in accuracy and relevance. Bing provided lower pieces of information with moderate accuracy and relevance. Wrtn's answer was short of data, with average accuracy and relevance. Claude AI had reasonable information but lower accuracy and relevance. Responses in English were superior in all aspects. Clova X was notably optimized for Korean, leading in relevance. CONCLUSION: In a study of 6 generative AIs applied to medical arthropodology, GPT-4 excelled overall, while Clova X, a Korea-based AI, achieved 100% relevance in Korean queries, the highest among its peers. Utilizing these AIs in classrooms enhanced the author's self-efficacy and interest in the subject, offering a positive experience of interacting with generative AIs to question and receive information.

Abstract: In this study, we sought to objectively and quantitatively characterize the prosodic features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) via the characteristics of prosody in a newly developed structured speech experiment. Male adults with high-functioning ASD and age/intelligence-matched men with typical development (TD) were asked to read 29 brief scripts aloud in response to preceding auditory stimuli. To investigate whether (1) highly structured acting-out tasks can uncover the prosodic of difference between those with ASD and TD, and (2) the prosodic stableness and flexibleness can be used for objective automatic assessment of ASD, we compared prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, and mora duration. The results indicate that individuals with ASD exhibit stable pitch registers or volume levels in some affective vocal-expression scenarios, such as those involving anger or sadness, compared with TD and those with TD. However, unstable prosody was observed in some timing control or emphasis tasks in the participants with ASD. Automatic classification of the ASD and TD groups using a support vector machine (SVM) with speech features exhibited an accuracy of 90.4%. A machine learning-based assessment of the degree of ASD core symptoms using support vector regression (SVR) also had good performance. These results may inform the development of a new easy-to-use assessment tool for ASD core symptoms using recorded audio signals.

Author: ['Grafe D', 'Beeskow AB', 'Pfaffle R', 'Rosolowski M', 'Chung TS', 'DiFranco MD']
Journal Title: European radiology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 28
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) software in bone age (BA) assessment, according to the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method in a German pediatric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hand radiographs of 306 pediatric patients aged 1-18 years (153 boys, 153 girls, 18 patients per year of life)-including a subgroup of patients in the age group for which the software is declared (243 patients)-were analyzed retrospectively. Two pediatric radiologists and one endocrinologist made independent blinded BA reads. Subsequently, AI software estimated BA from the same images. Both agreements, accuracy, and interchangeability between AI and expert readers were assessed. RESULTS: The mean difference between the average of three expert readers and AI software was 0.39 months with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 6.8 months (1.73 months for the mean difference and 6.0 months for MAD in the intended use subgroup). Performance in boys was slightly worse than in girls (MAD 6.3 months vs. 5.6 months). Regression analyses showed constant bias (slope of 1.01 with a 95% CI 0.99-1.02). The estimated equivalence index for interchangeability was - 14.3 (95% CI -27.6 to - 1.1). CONCLUSION: In terms of BA assessment, the new AI software was interchangeable with expert readers using the G&P method. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The use of AI software enables every physician to provide expert reader quality in bone age assessment. KEY POINTS: * A novel artificial intelligence-based software for bone age estimation has not yet been clinically validated. * Artificial intelligence showed a good agreement and high accuracy with expert radiologists performing bone age assessment. * Artificial intelligence showed to be interchangeable with expert readers.

Title: AI-augmented clinical decision in paediatric appendicitis: can an AI-generated model improve trainees' diagnostic capability?
Author: ['Shikha A', 'Kasem A', 'Han WSP', 'Wong JHL']
Journal Title: European journal of pediatrics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of paediatric appendicitis remains a challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations and reliance on subjective assessments. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with an expert's ''clinical sense'' has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Artificial Intelligence Pediatric Appendicitis Decision-tree (AiPAD) model in enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of trainees and compare their performance with that of an expert supervisor. Between March 2019 and October 2022, we included paediatric patients aged 0-12 years who were referred for suspected appendicitis. Trainees collected clinical findings using five predefined parameters before ordering any imaging studies. The AiPAD model, which was blinded to the surgical team, made predictions from the supervisor's and trainees' findings independently. The diagnosis verdicts of the supervisor and the trainees were statistically evaluated in comparison to the prediction of the AI model, taking into account the revealed correct diagnosis. A total of 136 cases were included, comprising 58 cases of acute appendicitis (AA) and 78 cases of non-appendicitis (NA). The supervisor's correct verdict showed 91% accuracy compared to an average of 70% for trainees. However, if trainees were enabled with AiPAD, their accuracy would improve significantly to an average of 97%. Significantly, a strong association was observed between the expert's clinical sense and the predictions generated by AiPAD. CONCLUSION:  The utilisation of the AiPAD model in diagnosing paediatric appendicitis has significant potential to improve trainees' diagnostic accuracy, approaching the level of an expert supervisor. This hybrid approach combining AI and expert knowledge holds promise for enhancing diagnostic capabilities, reducing medical errors and improving patient outcomes. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Sharpening clinical judgement for pediatric appendicitis takes time and seasoned exposure. Traditional training leaves junior doctors yearning for a faster path to diagnostic mastery. WHAT IS NEW: * AI-generated models unlock the secrets of expert intuition, crafting an explicit guide for juniors to rapidly elevate their diagnostic skills. This leapfrog advancement empowers young doctors, democratizing medical expertise and paving the way for brighter outcomes in clinical training.

Author: ['Taha MA', 'Morren JA']
Journal Title: Muscle & nerve
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have ushered in a new era of technological breakthroughs in healthcare. These technologies are revolutionizing the way we utilize medical data, enabling improved disease classification, more precise diagnoses, better treatment selection, therapeutic monitoring, and highly accurate prognostication. Different ML and DL models have been used to distinguish between electromyography signals in normal individuals and those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and myopathy, with accuracy ranging from 67% to 99.5%. DL models have also been successfully applied in neuromuscular ultrasound, with the use of segmentation techniques achieving diagnostic accuracy of at least 90% for nerve entrapment disorders, and 87% for inflammatory myopathies. Other successful AI applications include prediction of treatment response, and prognostication including prediction of intensive care unit admissions for patients with myasthenia gravis. Despite these remarkable strides, significant knowledge, attitude, and practice gaps persist, including within the field of electrodiagnostic and neuromuscular medicine. In this narrative review, we highlight the fundamental principles of AI and draw parallels with the intricacies of human brain networks. Specifically, we explore the immense potential that AI holds for applications in electrodiagnostic studies, neuromuscular ultrasound, and other aspects of neuromuscular medicine. While there are exciting possibilities for the future, it is essential to acknowledge and understand the limitations of AI and take proactive steps to mitigate these challenges. This collective endeavor holds immense potential for the advancement of healthcare through the strategic and responsible integration of AI technologies.

Title: Initiation of China Alliance of Research in High Myopia (CHARM): protocol for an AI-based multimodal high myopia research biobank.
Author: ['He HL', 'Liu YX', 'Song H', 'Xu TZ', 'Wong TY', 'Jin ZB']
Journal Title: BMJ open
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 27
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: High myopia is a pressing public health concern due to its increasing prevalence, younger trend and the high risk of blindness, particularly in East Asian countries, including China. The China Alliance of Research in High Myopia (CHARM) is a newly established consortium that includes more than 100 hospitals and institutions participating across the nation, aiming to promote collaboration and data sharing in the field of high myopia screening, classification, diagnosis and therapeutic development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CHARM project is an ongoing study, and its initiation is distinguished by its unprecedented scale, encompassing plans to involve over 100 000 Chinese patients. This initiative stands out not only for its extensive scope but also for its innovative application of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. The CHARM project has been carried out using a 'three-step' strategy. The first step involves the collection of basic information, refraction, axial length and fundus photographs from participants with high myopia. In the second step, we will collect multimodal imaging data to expand the scope of clinical information, for example, optical coherence tomography and ultra-widefield fundus images. In the final step, genetic testing will be conducted by incorporating patient family histories and blood samples. The majority of data collected by CHARM is in the form of images that will be used to detect and predict the progression of high myopia through the identification and quantification of biomarkers such as fundus tessellation, optic nerve head and vascular parameters. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital (TREC2022-KY045). The establishment of CHARM represents an opportunity to create a collaborative platform for myopia experts and facilitate the dissemination of research findings to the global community through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. These insights can inform clinical decision-making and contribute to the development of new treatment modalities that may benefit patients worldwide. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300071219.

Abstract: The International Society of AD (ISAD) organized a roundtable on global aspects of AD at the WCD 2023 in Singapore. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) consortium, at least 171 million individuals were affected with AD in 2019, corresponding to 2.23% of the world population, with age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates that were relatively stable from 1990 to 2019. Based on the panel experience, most AD cases are mild-to-moderate. Without parallel data on disease prevalence and severity, the GBD data are difficult to interpret in many regions. This gap is particularly important in countries with limited medical infrastructure, but indirect evidence suggests a significant burden of AD in low-and-medium resource settings, especially urban areas. The Singapore roundtable was an opportunity to compare experiences in World Bank category 1 (Madagascar and Mali), 3 (Brazil, China) and 4 (Australia, Germany, Qatar, USA, Singapore, Japan) countries. The panel concluded that current AD guidelines are not adapted for low resource settings and a more pragmatic approach, as developed by WHO for skin NTDs, would be advisable for minimal access to moisturizers and topical corticosteroids. The panel also recommended prioritizing prevention studies, regardless of the level of existing resources. For disease long-term control in World Bank category 3 and most category 4 countries, the main problem is not access to drugs for most mild-to-moderate cases, but rather poor compliance due to insufficient time at visits. Collaboration with WHO, patient advocacy groups and industry may promote global change, improve capacity training and fight current inequalities. Finally, optimizing management of AD and its comorbidities needs more action at the primary care level, because reaching specialist care is merely aspirational in most settings. Primary care empowerment with store and forward telemedicine and algorithms based on augmented intelligence is a future goal.
