Title: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Applications to Epilepsy: a Review for the Practicing Epileptologist.
Author: ['Kerr WT', 'McFarlane KN']
Journal Title: Current neurology and neuroscience reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are data-driven techniques to translate raw data into applicable and interpretable insights that can assist in clinical decision making. Some of these tools have extremely promising initial results, earning both great excitement and creating hype. This non-technical article reviews recent developments in ML/AI in epilepsy to assist the current practicing epileptologist in understanding both the benefits and limitations of integrating ML/AI tools into their clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: ML/AI tools have been developed to assist clinicians in almost every clinical decision including (1) predicting future epilepsy in people at risk, (2) detecting and monitoring for seizures, (3) differentiating epilepsy from mimics, (4) using data to improve neuroanatomic localization and lateralization, and (5) tracking and predicting response to medical and surgical treatments. We also discuss practical, ethical, and equity considerations in the development and application of ML/AI tools including chatbots based on Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT). ML/AI tools will change how clinical medicine is practiced, but, with rare exceptions, the transferability to other centers, effectiveness, and safety of these approaches have not yet been established rigorously. In the future, ML/AI will not replace epileptologists, but epileptologists with ML/AI will replace epileptologists without ML/AI.

Title: Four attributes of intelligence, a thousand questions.
Author: ['Bardal M', 'Chalmers E']
Journal Title: Biological cybernetics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Jeff Hawkins is one of those rare individuals who speaks the languages of both AI and neuroscience. In his recent book, "A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence", Hawkins proposes that current learning algorithms lack four attributes which will be necessary for true machine intelligence. Here we demonstrate that a minimal learning system which satisfies all four points can be constructed using only simple, classical machine learning techniques. We illustrate that such a system falls short of biological intelligence in some important ways. We suggest that Hawkins' list is a useful model, but the "recipe" for true intelligence-if there is one-may not be so easily defined.

Journal Title: Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Chromoendoscopy with the use of indigo carmine (IC) dye is a crucial endoscopic technique to identify gastrointestinal neoplasms. However, its performance is limited by the endoscopist's skill, and no standards are available for lesion identification. Thus, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to replace chromoendoscopy. METHODS: This pilot study assessed the feasibility of our novel AI model in the conversion of white-light images (WLI) into virtual IC-dyed images based on a generative adversarial network. The predictions of our AI model were evaluated against the assessments of five endoscopic experts who were blinded to the purpose of this study with a staining quality rating from 1 (unacceptable) to 4 (excellent). RESULTS: The AI model successfully transformed the WLI of polyps with different morphologies and different types of lesions in the gastrointestinal tract into virtual IC-dyed images. The quality ratings of the real IC-dyed and AI images did not significantly differ concerning surface structure (AI vs IC: 3.08 vs 3.00), lesion border (3.04 vs 2.98), and overall contrast (3.14 vs 3.02) from 10 sets of images (10 AI images and 10 real IC-dyed images). Although the score depended significantly on the evaluator, the staining methods (AI or real IC) and evaluators had no significant interaction (P > 0.05) with each other. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the feasibility of employing AI model's virtual IC staining, increasing the possibility of being employed in daily practice. This novel technology may facilitate gastrointestinal lesion identification in the future.

Title: A review of posterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses.
Author: ['Reinstein DZ', 'MacGregor C', 'Archer TJ', 'Gupta R', 'Potter JG']
Journal Title: Current opinion in ophthalmology
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 7
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Posterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs) are increasing in popularity as a viable alternative to laser refractive surgery. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the recent updates to pIOLs and to assess the advancements and safety of the procedure. RECENT FINDINGS: Accurate lens sizing is the key determinant to suitable vault prediction, advancements to sizing formulae including the use of very high frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound and the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to improved vault prediction and safety. The introduction of the central aquaport has been shown to reduce the formation of cataract and is now adopted in most myopic pIOLs. Recently published studies have demonstrated that pIOLs have an excellent safety profile with no increased risk of retinal detachment or endothelial cell loss. Advancements have led to the introduction of extended depth of focus pIOLs for the correction of presbyopia, further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of new lens designs. SUMMARY: pIOL surgery is experiencing traction with improved lens design and increased lenses choices such as larger optical zone and presbyopic options. Accuracy of implantable collamer lens sizing is paramount to the safety and clinical outcomes, greater predictability is likely to encourage more posterior chamber pIOL users due to fewer sizing related complications.

Title: Artificial intelligence in the NICU to predict extubation success in prematurely born infants.
Author: ['Jenkinson AC', 'Dassios T', 'Greenough A']
Journal Title: Journal of perinatal medicine
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Mechanical ventilation in prematurely born infants, particularly if prolonged, can cause long term complications including bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Timely extubation then is essential, yet predicting its success remains challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) may provide a potential solution. CONTENT: A narrative review was undertaken to explore AI's role in predicting extubation success in prematurely born infants. Across the 11 studies analysed, the range of reported area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) for the selected prediction models was between 0.7 and 0.87. Only two studies implemented an external validation procedure. Comparison to the results of clinical predictors was made in two studies. One group reported a logistic regression model that outperformed clinical predictors on decision tree analysis, while another group reported clinical predictors outperformed their artificial neural network model (AUCs: ANN 0.68 vs. clinical predictors 0.86). Amongst the studies there was an heterogenous selection of variables for inclusion in prediction models, as well as variations in definitions of extubation failure. SUMMARY: Although there is potential for AI to enhance extubation success, no model's performance has yet surpassed that of clinical predictors. OUTLOOK: Future studies should incorporate external validation to increase the applicability of the models to clinical settings.

Title: Prenatal tobacco exposure on brain morphometry partially mediated poor cognitive performance in preadolescent children.
Author: ['Rodriguez Rivera PJ', 'Liang H', 'Isaiah A', 'Cloak CC', 'Menken MS', 'Ryan MC', 'Ernst T', 'Chang L']
Journal Title: NeuroImmune pharmacology and therapeutics
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) is related to poorer cognitive performance, abnormal brain morphometry, and whether poor cognitive performance is mediated by PTE-related structural brain differences. METHODS: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study dataset was used to compare structural MRI data and neurocognitive (NIH Toolbox((R))) scores in 9-to-10-year-old children with (n=620) and without PTE (n=10,989). We also evaluated whether PTE effects on brain morphometry mediated PTE effects on neurocognitive scores. Group effects were evaluated using Linear Mixed Models, covaried for socio-demographics and prenatal exposures to alcohol and/or marijuana, and corrected for multiple comparisons using the false-discovery rate (FDR). RESULTS: Compared to unexposed children, those with PTE had poorer performance (all p-values <0.05) on executive function, working memory, episodic memory, reading decoding, crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence and overall cognition. Exposed children also had thinner parahippocampal gyri, smaller surface areas in the posterior-cingulate and pericalcarine cortices; the lingual and inferior parietal gyri, and smaller thalamic volumes (all p-values <0.001). Furthermore, among children with PTE, girls had smaller surface areas in the superior-frontal (interaction-FDR-p=0.01), precuneus (interaction-FDR-p=0.03) and postcentral gyri (interaction-FDR-p=0.02), while boys had smaller putamen volumes (interaction-FDR-p=0.02). Smaller surface areas across regions of the frontal and parietal lobes, and lower thalamic volumes, partially mediated the associations between PTE and poorer neurocognitive scores (p-values <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest PTE may lead to poorer cognitive performance and abnormal brain morphometry, with sex-specific effects in some brain regions, in pre-adolescent children. The poor cognition in children with PTE may result from the smaller areas and subcortical brain volumes.

Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Purpose: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant virus has resulted in an overload of hospitals around the globe. As a result, many patients are deprived of hospital facilities, increasing mortality rates. Therefore, mortality rates can be reduced by efficiently assigning facilities to higher-risk patients. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate patients' survival probability based on their conditions at the time of admission so that the minimum required facilities can be provided, allowing more opportunities to be available for those who need them. Although radiologic findings in chest computerized tomography scans show various patterns, considering the individual risk factors and other underlying diseases, it is difficult to predict patient prognosis through routine clinical or statistical analysis. Method: In this study, a deep neural network model is proposed for predicting survival based on simple clinical features, blood tests, axial computerized tomography scan images of lungs, and the patients' planned treatment. The model's architecture combines a Convolutional Neural Network and a Long Short Term Memory network. The model was trained using 390 survivors and 108 deceased patients from the Rasoul Akram Hospital and evaluated 109 surviving and 36 deceased patients infected by the omicron variant. Results: The proposed model reached an accuracy of 87.5% on the test data, indicating survival prediction possibility. The accuracy was significantly higher than the accuracy achieved by classical machine learning methods without considering computerized tomography scan images (p-value <= 4E-5). The images were also replaced with hand-crafted features related to the ratio of infected lung lobes used in classical machine-learning models. The highest-performing model reached an accuracy of 84.5%, which was considerably higher than the models trained on mere clinical information (p-value <= 0.006). However, the performance was still significantly less than the deep model (p-value <= 0.016). Conclusion: The proposed deep model achieved a higher accuracy than classical machine learning methods trained on features other than computerized tomography scan images. This proves the images contain extra information. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence methods with multimodal inputs can be more reliable and accurate than computerized tomography severity scores.

Title: CerviCell-detector: An object detection approach for identifying the cancerous cells in pap smear images of cervical cancer.
Author: ['Kalbhor M', 'Shinde S', 'Wajire P', 'Jude H']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most commonly seen cancer in women. It affects the cervix portion of the vagina. The most preferred diagnostic test required for screening for cervical cancer is the pap smear test. Pap smear is a time-consuming test as it requires detailed analysis by expert cytologists. Cytologists can screen around 100 to 1000 slides depending upon the availability of advanced equipment. It requires substantial time and effort to carefully examine each slide, identify and classify cells, and make accurate diagnoses. Prolonged periods of visual inspection can increase the likelihood of human errors, such as overlooking abnormalities or misclassifying cells. The sheer volume of slides to be screened can exacerbate fatigue and impact diagnostic accuracy. Due to this reason Artificial intelligence (AI) based computer-aided diagnosis system for the classification and detection of pap smear images is needed. There are some AI-based solutions proposed in the literature, still, an effective and accurate system is under research. In this paper, we implement a state-of-the-art object detection model with a newly available CRIC dataset which follows the Bethesda system for nomenclature. Object detection models implemented are YOLOv5 which uses the CSPNet backbone, Faster R-CNN which has Region Proposal Network (RPN) and Detectron2 framework created by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) Group. ResNext model is implemented among the available models from Detectron2. The CRIC dataset is preprocessed and augmented using Roboflow tool. The performance measures of Average Precision and mean Average precision over the Intersection over Union (IoU) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the models. The models performed better for two classes namely Normal and Abnormal compared to six classes from the Bethesda system. The highest mean Average Precision (mAP) is observed on the augmented dataset for YOLOv5 models for binary classification with 83 % mAP with IoU in the range of 0.50-0.95.

Author: ['Raman R', 'Kumar Nair V', 'Nedungadi P', 'Ray I', 'Achuthan K']
Journal Title: Heliyon
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: The Darkweb, part of the deep web, can be accessed only through specialized computer software and used for illegal activities such as cybercrime, drug trafficking, and exploitation. Technological advancements like Tor, bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies allow criminals to carry out these activities anonymously, leading to increased use of the Darkweb. At the same time, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping our behavior, and influencing how we interact with each other and the world. This work carries out the bibliometric study on the research conducted on Darkweb over the last decade. The findings illustrate that most research on Darkweb can be clustered into four areas based on keyword co-occurrence analysis: (i) network security, malware, and cyber-attacks, (ii) cybercrime, data privacy, and cryptography, (iii) machine learning, social media, and artificial intelligence, and (iv) drug trafficking, cryptomarket. National Science Foundation from the United States is the top funder. Darkweb activities interfere with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) laid forth by the United Nations to promote peace and sustainability for current and future generations. SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) has the highest number of publications and citations but has an inverse relationship with Darkweb, as the latter undermines the former. This study highlights the need for further research in bitcoin, blockchain, IoT, NLP, cryptocurrencies, phishing and cybercrime, botnets and malware, digital forensics, and electronic crime countermeasures about the Darkweb. The study further elucidates the multi-dimensional nature of the Darkweb, emphasizing the intricate relationship between technology, psychology, and geopolitics. This comprehensive understanding serves as a cornerstone for evolving effective countermeasures and calls for an interdisciplinary research approach. The study also delves into the psychological motivations driving individuals towards illegal activities on the Darkweb, highlighting the urgency for targeted interventions to promote pro-social online behavior.

Journal Title: Liver cancer
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Because of recent developments in treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), methods for determining suitable therapy for initial or recurrent HCC have become important. This study used artificial intelligence (AI) findings to establish a system for predicting prognosis of HCC patients at time of reoccurrence based on clinical data as a reference for selection of treatment modalities. METHODS: As a training cohort, 5,701 observations obtained at the initial and each subsequent treatment for recurrence from 1,985 HCC patients at a single center from 2000 to 2021 were used. The validation cohort included 5,692 observations from patients at multiple centers obtained at the time of the initial treatment. An AI calculating system (PRAID) was constructed based on 25 clinical factors noted at each treatment from the training cohort, and then predictive prognostic values for 1- and 3-year survival in both cohorts were evaluated. RESULTS: After exclusion of patients lacking clinical data regarding albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade or tumor-node-metastasis stage of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan, 6th edition (TNM-LCSGJ 6th), ALBI-TNM-LCSGJ 6th (ALBI-T) and modified ALBI-T scores confirmed that prognosis for patients in both cohorts was similar. The area under the curve for prediction of both 1- and 3-year survival in the validation cohort was 0.841 (sensitivity 0.933 [95% CI: 0.925-0.940], specificity 0.517 [95% CI: 0.484-0.549]) and 0.796 (sensitivity 0.806 [95% CI: 0.790-0.821], specificity 0.646 [95% CI: 0.624-0.668]), respectively. CONCLUSION: The present PRAID system might provide useful prognostic information related to short and medium survival for decision-making regarding the best therapeutic modality for both initial and recurrent HCC cases.

Title: Knowledge, Attitude and Perception Regarding Artificial Intelligence in Periodontology: A Questionnaire Study.
Author: ['Chawla RL', 'Gadge NP', 'Ronad S', 'Waghmare A', 'Patil A', 'Deshmukh G']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models has brought about a significant transformation in the manner in which periodontists gather information, evaluate associated risks, develop diverse treatment alternatives, anticipate and diagnose dental conditions that compromise periodontal health. The principal objective of this prospective study was to examine periodontists' understanding and acceptance of the application of AI in the realm of periodontology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study was conducted on 275 participants based on questionnaire using Google Forms. These forms were pre-validated and subsequently circulated among periodontists in Maharashtra via various social media platforms. The study, in its entirety, comprised four open-ended questions on participants' demographics and 14 closed-ended questions, all of which were presented to the participants in English. These questions aimed to elicit participants' awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives regarding emerging applications of AI in the field of periodontology. To analyze the collected data, researchers employed the widely utilized Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULT: A 75% response rate was achieved and 68% of the respondents were female. 62% periodontists were aware of AI; however, only 24% were aware of its working principles. Most respondents agreed with the use of AI in periodontal diagnosis; however, they disagreed with the use of AI in predicting clinical attachment loss (69%). 80-82% respondents felt that AI should be a part of postgraduate training and should be implemented in clinical practice. However, most periodontists do not use AI for diagnostic or research purposes. 49% periodontists felt that AI does not have better diagnostic accuracy than periodontists, and therefore cannot replace them in the future. CONCLUSION: Most periodontists possessed a reasonable level of understanding regarding the utilization of AI in the domain of periodontology and expressed a desire to incorporate it into their diagnostic and treatment planning processes for periodontal conditions. Additional endeavors must be undertaken to enhance periodontists' awareness concerning the effective implementation of AI within their professional practice, with the aim of facilitating personalized treatment planning for their respective patients. It is postulated that the integration of AI will augment the likelihood of achieving favorable outcomes within the realm of periodontology.

Title: ChatGPT in Answering Queries Related to Lifestyle-Related Diseases and Disorders.
Author: ['Mondal H', 'Dash I', 'Mondal S', 'Behera JK']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Background Lifestyle-related diseases and disorders have become a significant global health burden. However, the majority of the population ignores or do not consult doctors for such disease or disorders. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT (GPT3.5) is capable of generating customized queries of a user. Hence, it can act as a virtual telehealth agent. Its capability to answer lifestyle-related diseases or disorders has not been explored. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an LLM, in providing answers to queries related to lifestyle-related diseases or disorders. Methods A set of 20 lifestyle-related disease or disorder cases covering a wide range of topics such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, and mental health were prepared with four questions. The case and questions were presented to ChatGPT and asked for the answers to those questions. Two physicians rated the content on a three-point Likert-like scale ranging from accurate (2), partially accurate (1), and inaccurate (0). Further, the content was rated as adequate (2), inadequate (1), and misguiding (0) for testing the applicability of the guides for patients. The readability of the text was analyzed by the Flesch-Kincaid Ease Score (FKES).  Results Among 20 cases, the average score of accuracy was 1.83+/-0.37 and guidance was 1.9+/-0.21. Both the scores were higher than the hypothetical median of 1.5 (p=0.004 and p<0.0001, respectively). ChatGPT answered the questions with a natural tone in 11 cases and nine with a positive tone. The text was understandable for college graduates with a mean FKES of 27.8+/-5.74. Conclusion The analysis of content accuracy revealed that ChatGPT provided reasonably accurate information in the majority of the cases, successfully addressing queries related to lifestyle-related diseases or disorders. Hence, initial guidance can be obtained by patients when they get little time to consult a doctor or wait for an appointment to consult a doctor for suggestions about their condition.

Abstract: Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in plant gene regulation, involving both epigenetic and transcript regulation. LncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into functional proteins but can be translated into small peptides. Machine learning models have predominantly used transcriptome data with manually defined features to detect lncRNAs, however, they often underrepresent the abundance of lncRNAs and can be biased in their detection. Here we present a study using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to identify plant lncRNAs from genomic sequences rather than transcriptomic data. The NLP models were trained to predict lncRNAs for seven model and crop species (Zea mays, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Glycine max and Oryza sativa) using publicly available genomic references. We demonstrated that lncRNAs can be accurately predicted from genomic sequences with the highest accuracy of 83.4% for Z. mays and the lowest accuracy of 57.9% for B. rapa, revealing that genome assembly quality might affect the accuracy of lncRNA identification. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential of using NLP models for cross-species prediction with an average of 63.1% accuracy using target species not previously seen by the model. As more species are incorporated into the training datasets, we expect the accuracy to increase, becoming a more reliable tool for uncovering novel lncRNAs. Finally, we show that the models can be interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence to identify motifs important to lncRNA prediction and that these motifs frequently flanked the lncRNA sequence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Discrimination of gastrointestinal tuberculosis (GITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult. Use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies may help in discriminating these two entities. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on the use of AI for discrimination of GITB and CD. Electronic databases (PubMed and Embase) were searched on June 6, 2022, to identify relevant studies. We included any study reporting the use of clinical, endoscopic, and radiological information (textual or images) to discriminate GITB and CD using any AI technique. Quality of studies was assessed with MI-CLAIM checklist. RESULTS: Out of 27 identified results, a total of 9 studies were included. All studies used retrospective databases. There were five studies of only endoscopy-based AI, one of radiology-based AI, and three of multiparameter-based AI. The AI models performed fairly well with high accuracy ranging from 69.6-100%. Text-based convolutional neural network was used in three studies and Classification and regression tree analysis used in two studies. Interestingly, irrespective of the AI method used, the performance of discriminating GITB and CD did not match in discriminating from other diseases (in studies where a third disease was also considered). CONCLUSION: The use of AI in differentiating GITB and CD seem to have acceptable accuracy but there were no direct comparisons with traditional multiparameter models. The use of multiple parameter-based AI models have the potential for further exploration in search of an ideal tool and improve on the accuracy of traditional models.

Abstract: MOTIVATION: Pediatric kidney disease is a widespread, progressive condition that severely impacts growth and development of children. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is often more insidious in children than in adults, usually requiring a renal biopsy for diagnosis. Biopsy evaluation requires copious examination by trained pathologists, which can be tedious and prone to human error. In this study, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) method to assist pathologists in accurate segmentation and classification of pediatric kidney structures, named as AI-based Pediatric Kidney Diagnosis (APKD). RESULTS: We collected 2,935 pediatric patients diagnosed with kidney disease for the development of APKD. The dataset comprised 93,932 histological structures annotated manually by three skilled nephropathologists. APKD scored an average accuracy of 94% for each kidney structure category, including 99% in the glomerulus. We found strong correlation between the model and manual detection in detected glomeruli (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.98, p-value < 0.001; intraclass correlation coefficient ICC = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96-0.98). Compared to manual detection, APKD was approximately 5.5 times faster in segmenting glomeruli. Finally, we show how the pathological features extracted by APKD can identify focal abnormalities of the glomerular capillary wall to aid in the early diagnosis of pediatric kidney disease.

Abstract: Objective: To explore the application of manual screening collaborated with the Artificial Intelligence TPS-Assisted Cytologic Screening System in urinary exfoliative cytology and its clinical values. Methods: A total of 3 033 urine exfoliated cytology samples were collected at the Henan People's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. Liquid-based thin-layer cytology was prepared. The slides were manually read under the microscope and digitally presented using a scanner. The intelligent identification and analysis were carried out using an artificial intelligence TPS assisted screening system. The Paris Report Classification System of Urinary Exfoliated Cytology 2022 was used as the evaluation standard. Atypical urothelial cells and even higher grade lesions were considered as positive when evaluating the recognition sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence-assisted screening systems and human-machine collaborative cytologic screening methods in urine exfoliative cytology. Among the collected cases, there were also 1 100 pathological tissue controls. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted cytologic screening system were 77.18%, 90.79% and 69.49%; those of human-machine coordination method were 92.89%, 99.63% and 89.09%, respectively. Compared with the histopathological results, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of manual reading were 79.82%, 74.20% and 95.80%, respectively, while those of AI-assisted cytologic screening system were 93.45%, 93.73% and 92.66%, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of human-machine coordination method were 95.36%, 95.21% and 95.80%, respectively. Both cytological and histological controls showed that human-machine coordination review method had higher diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity, and lower false negative rates. Conclusions: The artificial intelligence TPS assisted cytologic screening system has achieved acceptable accuracy in urine exfoliation cytologic screening. The combination of manual screening and artificial intelligence TPS assisted screening system can effectively improve the sensitivity and accuracy of cytologic screening and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used successfully in human dermatology. AI utilises convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accomplish tasks such as image classification, object detection and segmentation, facilitating early diagnosis. Computer vision (CV), a field of AI, has shown great results in detecting signs of human skin diseases. Canine paw skin diseases are a common problem in general veterinary practice, and computer vision tools could facilitate the detection and monitoring of disease processes. Currently, no such tool is available in veterinary dermatology. ANIMALS: Digital images of paws from healthy dogs and paws with pododermatitis or neoplasia were used. OBJECTIVES: We tested the novel object detection model Pawgnosis, a Tiny YOLOv4 image analysis model deployed on a microcomputer with a camera for the rapid detection of canine pododermatitis and neoplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prediction performance metrics used to evaluate the models included mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall, average precision (AP) for accuracy and frames per second (FPS) for speed. RESULTS: A large dataset labelled by a single individual (Dataset A) used to train a Tiny YOLOv4 model provided the best results with a mean mAP of 0.95, precision of 0.86, recall of 0.93 and 20 FPS. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This novel object detection model has the potential for application in the field of veterinary dermatology.

Abstract: BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Mucosal healing (MH) in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is an important landmark for clinical decision making. Artificial intelligence systems (AI) that automatically deliver the grade of endoscopic inflammation may solve moderate interobserver agreement and the need of central reading in clinical trials. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of EMBASE and MEDLINE databases up to 01/12/2022 following PRISMA and the Joanna Briggs Institute methodologies to answer the following question: "Can AI replace endoscopists when assessing MH in IBD?". The research was restricted to ulcerative colitis (UC), and a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) meta-analysis was performed. Risk of bias was evaluated with QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: A total of 21 / 739 records were selected for full text evaluation, and 12 were included in the meta-analysis. Deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks architecture achieved a satisfactory performance in evaluating MH on UC, with sensitivity, specificity, DOR and SROC of respectively 0.91(CI95 %:0.86-0.95);0.89(CI95 %:0.84-0.93);92.42(CI95 %:54.22-157.53) and 0.957 when evaluating fixed images (n = 8) and 0.86(CI95 %:0.75-0.93);0.91(CI95 %:0.87-0.94);70.86(CI95 %:24.63-203.86) and 0.941 when evaluating videos (n = 6). Moderate-high levels of heterogeneity were noted, limiting the quality of the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: AI systems showed high potential in detecting MH in UC with optimal diagnostic performance, although moderate-high heterogeneity of the data was noted. Standardised and shared AI training may reduce heterogeneity between systems.

Abstract: This paper deals with a comparative evaluation of nonlinear controllers based on the linear regression technique, which is a machine learning algorithm for maximum power point tracking. In the past decade, most photovoltaic systems have been equipped with classical algorithms such as perturb and observe, hill climbing, and incremental conductance. The simplicity of these techniques and their ease of implementation were seen as the main reasons for their utilization in photovoltaic systems. However, researchers' attention has recently been attracted by artificial intelligence-based techniques such as linear regression, which offer better performance within the bounds of the nonlinearity of photovoltaic system characteristics. An adaptive terminal synergetic backstepping controller is developed in this paper for a single-ended primary inductance converter. This control scheme is based on the combination of a non-singular terminal synergetic technique with an integral backstepping technique and equally a neural network for the approximation of unmeasured or inaccessible variables that guarantees the finite-time convergence. The proposed controller was further verified under virtual and real environmental conditions, and the numerical results obtained from Matlab/Simulink software under various test conditions, including load variations, show that the adaptive terminal synergetic backstepping controller gives satisfactory performance compared to the adaptive integral backstepping controller used in the same climatic conditions.
