Title: Precision Hypertension.
Author: ['Dzau VJ', 'Hodgkinson CP']
Journal Title: Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Hypertension affects >1 billion people worldwide. Complications of hypertension include stroke, renal failure, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure. Despite the development of various antihypertensive drugs, the number of people with uncontrolled hypertension continues to rise. While the lack of compliance associated with frequent side effects to medication is a contributory issue, there has been a failure to consider the diverse nature of hypertensive populations. Instead, we propose that hypertension can only be truly managed by precision. A precision medicine approach would consider each patient's unique factors. In this review, we discuss the progress toward precision medicine for hypertension with more predictiveness and individualization of treatment. We will highlight the advances in data science, omics (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc), artificial intelligence, gene therapy, and gene editing and their application to precision hypertension.

Author: ['Lian L', 'Zhang Q', 'Li W', 'Wang B', 'Liang Q']
Journal Title: Nanoscale
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Liquid detection probes used to identify the features of liquids show great promise in a variety of important applications. However, some challenges, such as sample contamination by direct contact with the liquid, the requirement of additional signal emitters, and complex fabrication, hindered the development of liquid detection probes. Here, we developed a non-invasive shadow probe (SP) for a multi-feature intelligent liquid surveillance system (ILSS). The self-powered SP with the working mechanism of the shadow effect can detect the features of liquids by analyzing the variations of liquid shadows such as the area, wavelength, and brightness. The exact resolution (5 different colors, 6 different concentrations, 6 different levels, 100% accuracy) and fast response time (0.2 ms) are shown by the SP under ambient light conditions (even in 0.003 sun). The ILSS, which integrated the SPs with signal processing circuits and applied the artificial intelligence (AI) technique, successfully detects and synoptically learns about liquids simultaneously. The in-real time ILSS reaches a test accuracy of 99.3% for 10 types of liquids with multiple features. This work showcases a promising solution for non-invasive multi-feature liquid detection, displaying great potential for future applications.

Title: Safety of Large Language Models in Addressing Depression.
Author: ['Heston TF']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Anthropic, are currently under intense investigation for their potential to address existing gaps in mental health support. One implementation of these large language models involves the development of mental health-focused conversational agents, which utilize pre-structured prompts to facilitate user interaction without requiring specialized knowledge in prompt engineering. However, uncertainties persist regarding the safety and efficacy of these agents in recognizing severe depression and suicidal tendencies. Given the well-established correlation between the severity of depression and the risk of suicide, improperly calibrated conversational agents may inadequately identify and respond to crises. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate whether publicly accessible repositories of mental health-focused conversational agents can consistently and safely address crisis scenarios before considering their adoption in clinical settings. This study assesses the safety of publicly available ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents by evaluating their responses to a patient simulation indicating worsening depression and suicidality. Methodology This study evaluated ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents on a publicly available repository specifically designed for mental health counseling. Each conversational agent was evaluated twice by a highly structured patient simulation. First, the simulation indicated escalating suicide risk based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). For the second patient simulation, the escalating risk was presented in a more generalized manner not associated with an existing risk scale to assess the more generalized ability of the conversational agent to recognize suicidality. Each simulation recorded the exact point at which the conversational agent recommended human support. Then, the simulation continued until the conversational agent stopped entirely and shut down completely, insisting on human intervention. Results All 25 agents available on the public repository FlowGPT.com were evaluated. The point at which the conversational agents referred to a human occurred around the mid-point of the simulation, and definitive shutdown predominantly only happened at the highest risk levels. For the PHQ-9 simulation, the average initial referral and shutdown aligned with PHQ-9 scores of 12 (moderate depression) and 25 (severe depression). Few agents included crisis resources - only two referenced suicide hotlines. Despite the conversational agents insisting on human intervention, 22 out of 25 agents would eventually resume the dialogue if the simulation reverted to a lower risk level. Conclusions Current generative AI-based conversational agents are slow to escalate mental health risk scenarios, postponing referral to a human to potentially dangerous levels. More rigorous testing and oversight of conversational agents are needed before deployment in mental healthcare settings. Additionally, further investigation should explore if sustained engagement worsens outcomes and whether enhanced accessibility outweighs the risks of improper escalation. Advancing AI safety in mental health remains imperative as these technologies continue rapidly advancing.

Title: Model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence tools for severity prediction and symptom analysis on Indian COVID-19 data.
Author: ['Nambiar A', 'S H', 'S S']
Journal Title: Frontiers in artificial intelligence
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and created an unprecedented emergency in healthcare and other related frontline sectors. Various Artificial-Intelligence-based models were developed to effectively manage medical resources and identify patients at high risk. However, many of these AI models were limited in their practical high-risk applicability due to their "black-box" nature, i.e., lack of interpretability of the model. To tackle this problem, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was introduced, aiming to explore the "black box" behavior of machine learning models and offer definitive and interpretable evidence. XAI provides interpretable analysis in a human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence in the successful implementation of AI systems in the wild. METHODS: In this regard, this study explores the use of model-agnostic XAI models, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), for COVID-19 symptom analysis in Indian patients toward a COVID severity prediction task. Various machine learning models such as Decision Tree Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Neural Network Classifier are leveraged to develop Machine Learning models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The proposed XAI tools are found to augment the high performance of AI systems with human interpretable evidence and reasoning, as shown through the interpretation of various explainability plots. Our comparative analysis illustrates the significance of XAI tools and their impact within a healthcare context. The study suggests that SHAP and LIME analysis are promising methods for incorporating explainability in model development and can lead to better and more trustworthy ML models in the future.

Journal Title: Plastic and reconstructive surgery. Global open
Publication Date: 2023 Dec
Abstract: BACKGROUND: As artificial intelligence makes rapid inroads across various fields, its value in medical education is becoming increasingly evident. This study evaluates the performance of the GPT-4.0 large language model in responding to plastic surgery board examination questions and explores its potential as a learning tool. METHODS: We used a selection of 50 questions from 19 different chapters of a widely-used plastic surgery reference. Responses generated by the GPT-4.0 model were assessed based on four parameters: accuracy, clarity, completeness, and conciseness. Correlation analyses were conducted to ascertain the relationship between these parameters and the overall performance of the model. RESULTS: GPT-4.0 showed a strong performance with high mean scores for accuracy (2.88), clarity (3.00), completeness (2.88), and conciseness (2.92) on a three-point scale. Completeness of the model's responses was significantly correlated with accuracy (P < 0.0001), whereas no significant correlation was found between accuracy and clarity or conciseness. Performance variability across different chapters indicates potential limitations of the model in dealing with certain complex topics in plastic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The GPT-4.0 model exhibits considerable potential as an auxiliary tool for preparation for plastic surgery board examinations. Despite a few identified limitations, the generally high scores on key parameters suggest the model's ability to provide responses that are accurate, clear, complete, and concise. Future research should focus on enhancing the performance of artificial intelligence models in complex medical topics, further improving their applicability in medical education.

Author: ['Segura J', 'Rose Y', 'Bi C', 'Duarte J', 'Burley SK', 'Bittrich S']
Journal Title: Frontiers in bioinformatics
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (e.g., AlphaFold, RosettaFold, and ESMFold) enable prediction of three-dimensional (3D) protein structures from amino acid sequences alone at accuracies comparable to lower-resolution experimental methods. These tools have been employed to predict structures across entire proteomes and the results of large-scale metagenomic sequence studies, yielding an exponential increase in available biomolecular 3D structural information. Given the enormous volume of this newly computed biostructure data, there is an urgent need for robust tools to manage, search, cluster, and visualize large collections of structures. Equally important is the capability to efficiently summarize and visualize metadata, biological/biochemical annotations, and structural features, particularly when working with vast numbers of protein structures of both experimental origin from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and computationally-predicted models. Moreover, researchers require advanced visualization techniques that support interactive exploration of multiple sequences and structural alignments. This paper introduces a suite of tools provided on the RCSB PDB research-focused web portal RCSB. org, tailor-made for efficient management, search, organization, and visualization of this burgeoning corpus of 3D macromolecular structure data.

Author: ['Luo X', 'Zhang Z', 'Shi X', 'He C', 'Wang J', 'Wu Q', 'Huang G']
Journal Title: Frontiers in public health
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated the urgency for innovative mental health interventions. We performed a comprehensive review of the available literature on the utility and efficacy of arts therapies in treating mental health problems, with special emphasis on their deployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to provide some evidence for the application of this therapy. METHODS: The potential studies were systematically sourced from five authoritative databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the CNKI database. The evaluation of these studies was conducted based on stringent criteria, including validity, suitability, therapeutic potential, and consistency. Each piece of included literature was meticulously scored in accordance with these criteria, thus ensuring the inclusion of only the most robust studies in this review. The data from these Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were carefully extracted using the PICO(S) framework, ensuring a comprehensive and systemic approach to data collection. In order to emphasize the variability in the effects of differing arts therapies on COVID-19-induced psychiatric disturbances, the sourced literature was systematically categorized and scrutinized based on distinct modalities. RESULTS: Out of the 7,250 sourced articles, 16 satisfied the inclusion conditions. The therapies were predominantly meditation (n = 7), supplemented by individual studies on color therapy (n = 3), music therapy (n = 2), and single studies on horticultural therapy, dance therapy, mindfulness and music therapy, and yoga and music therapy (n = 4 collectively). These various forms of arts therapies had a positive short to medium-term impact on the mental health of COVID-19 patients. Besides improving patients' physical and mental health, these therapies can also be employed to mitigate mental health issues among healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has profound and long-lasting implications for public mental health. Diverse forms of arts therapies are potentially effective in addressing related psychiatric symptoms. The integration of artificial intelligence might further enhance the efficacy and scalability of arts therapies in future implementations.

Title: Aesthetic Motivation Impacts Judgments of Others' Prosociality and Mental Life.
Author: ['Agrawal T', 'Schachner A']
Journal Title: Open mind : discoveries in cognitive science
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: The ability to infer others' prosocial vs. antisocial behavioral tendencies from minimal information is core to social reasoning. Aesthetic motivation (the value or appreciation of aesthetic beauty) is linked with prosocial tendencies, raising the question of whether this factor is used in interpersonal reasoning and in the attribution of mental capacities. We propose and test a model of this reasoning, predicting that evidence of others' aesthetic motivations should impact judgments of others' prosocial (and antisocial) tendencies by signaling a heightened capacity for emotional experience. In a series of four pre-registered experiments (total N = 1440), participants saw pairs of characters (as photos/vignettes), and judged which in each pair showed more of a mental capacity of interest. Distractor items prevented participants from guessing the hypothesis. For one critical pair of characters, both characters performed the same activity (music listening, painting, cooking, exercising, being in nature, doing math), but one was motivated by the activities' aesthetic value, and the other by its functional value. Across all activities, participants robustly chose aesthetically-motivated characters as more likely to behave compassionately (Exp. 1; 3), less likely to behave selfishly/manipulatively (Exp. 1; 3), and as more emotionally sensitive, but not more intelligent (Exp. 2; 3; 4). Emotional sensitivity best predicted compassionate behavior judgements (Exp. 3). Aesthetically-motivated characters were not reliably chosen as more helpful; intelligence best predicted helpfulness judgements (Exp. 4). Evidence of aesthetic motivation conveys important social information about others, impacting fundamental interpersonal judgments about others' mental life and social behavior.

Title: ChatGPT-4 and Human Researchers Are Equal in Writing Scientific Introduction Sections: A Blinded, Randomized, Non-inferiority Controlled Study.
Author: ['Sikander B', 'Baker JJ', 'Deveci CD', 'Lund L', 'Rosenberg J']
Journal Title: Cureus
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Background Natural language processing models are increasingly used in scientific research, and their ability to perform various tasks in the research process is rapidly advancing. This study aims to investigate whether Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is equal to humans in writing introduction sections for scientific articles. Methods This randomized non-inferiority study was reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for non-inferiority trials and artificial intelligence (AI) guidelines. GPT-4 was instructed to synthesize 18 introduction sections based on the aim of previously published studies, and these sections were compared to the human-written introductions already published in a medical journal. Eight blinded assessors randomly evaluated the introduction sections using 1-10 Likert scales. Results There was no significant difference between GPT-4 and human introductions regarding publishability and content quality. GPT-4 had one point significantly better scores in readability, which was considered a non-relevant difference. The majority of assessors (59%) preferred GPT-4, while 33% preferred human-written introductions. Based on Lix and Flesch-Kincaid scores, GPT-4 introductions were 10 and two points higher, respectively, indicating that the sentences were longer and had longer words. Conclusion GPT-4 was found to be equal to humans in writing introductions regarding publishability, readability, and content quality. The majority of assessors preferred GPT-4 introductions and less than half could determine which were written by GPT-4 or humans. These findings suggest that GPT-4 can be a useful tool for writing introduction sections, and further studies should evaluate its ability to write other parts of scientific articles.

Author: ['Kavadella A', 'Dias da Silva MA', 'Kaklamanos E', 'Stamatopoulos V', 'Giannakopoulos K']
Journal Title: JMIR medical education
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The recently introduced Artificial Intelligence tool ChatGPT seems to offer a range of benefits in academic education, while also raising concerns. The relevant literature revolves around issues of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as well as pedagogy and educational affordances, yet no real-life implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process has been reported to our knowledge so far. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate ChatGPT's implementation in the educational process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. METHODS: In March 2023, seventy-seven 2nd-year dental students of the European University Cyprus were divided in two groups and asked to compose a learning assignment on "Radiation biology and Radiation protection in the dental office", working collaboratively in small sub-groups, as part of the educational semester program of the Dentomaxillofacial Radiology module. Careful planning ensured a seamless integration of ChatGPT, addressing potential challenges. One group searched the internet for scientific resources to perform the task and the other group used ChatGPT for this purpose. Both groups developed a PowerPoint presentation based on their researches and presented it in-class. The ChatGPT group students additionally registered all interactions with the language model during the prompting process and evaluated the final outcome; they also answered an open-ended Evaluation Questionnaire, including questions on their learning experience. Finally, all students undertook a knowledge exam on the topic and the grades between the two groups were compared statistically, whereas the free-text comments of the Questionnaires were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Out of the 77 students, 39 were assigned to the ChatGPT group and 38 to the literature research group. Seventy students undertook the MCQ knowledge exam and exam grades ranged from 5-10 on the 0-10 grading scale. The Mann-Whitney test showed that students of the ChatGPT group performed significantly better (p=0.045) than students of the literature research group. The Evaluation Questionnaires revealed the benefits (human-like interface, immediate response, wide knowledge base), the limitations (need for rephrasing the prompts to get a relevant answer, general content, false citations, incapability to provide images/videos) and the prospects (in education, clinical practice, continuing education, research) of ChatGPT. CONCLUSIONS: Students using ChatGPT for their learning assignments performed significantly better in the knowledge exam than their fellow students who used the literature research methodology. Students adapted quickly to the technological environment of the language model, recognized its opportunities and limitations and used it creatively and efficiently. Implications for Practice: The study underscores the adaptability of students to technological innovations like ChatGPT and its potential to enhance educational outcomes. Educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into curriculum design; awareness programs are warranted to educate both students and educators about the limitations of ChatGPT, encouraging critical engagement and responsible use.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This paper discusses how collective intelligence (CI) methods can be implemented to improve government data infrastructures, not only to support understanding and primary use of complex national data but also to increase the dissemination and secondary impact of research based on these data. The case study uses the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS), a member of the UK family of census/administrative data longitudinal studies (UKLS). METHODS: A stakeholder-engaged CI approach was applied to inform the transformation of the NILS Research Support Unit (RSU) infrastructure to support researchers in their use of government data, including collaborative decision-making and better dissemination of research outputs. RESULTS: We provide an overview of NILS RSU infrastructure design changes that have been implemented to date, focusing on a website redesign to meet user information requirements and the formation of better working partnerships between data users and providers within the Northern Ireland data landscape. We also discuss the key challenges faced by the design team during this project of transformation. CONCLUSION: Our primary objective to improve government data infrastructure and to increase dissemination and the impact of research based on data was a complex and multifaceted challenge due to the number of stakeholders involved and their often conflicting perspectives. Results from this CI approach have been pivotal in highlighting how NILS RSU can work collaboratively with users to maximize the potential of this data, in terms of forming multidisciplinary networks to ensure the research is utilized in policy and in the literature and providing academic support and resources to attract new researchers.

Title: Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Asthma Exacerbations: A Narrative Review.
Author: ['Molfino NA', 'Turcatel G', 'Riskin D']
Journal Title: Advances in therapy
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in healthcare has garnered significant attention in recent years, especially as a result of their potential to revolutionize personalized medicine. Despite advances in the treatment and management of asthma, a significant proportion of patients continue to suffer acute exacerbations, irrespective of disease severity and therapeutic regimen. The situation is further complicated by the constellation of factors that influence disease activity in a patient with asthma, such as medical history, biomarker phenotype, pulmonary function, level of healthcare access, treatment compliance, comorbidities, personal habits, and environmental conditions. A growing body of work has demonstrated the potential for AI and ML to accurately predict asthma exacerbations while also capturing the entirety of the patient experience. However, application in the clinical setting remains mostly unexplored, and important questions on the strengths and limitations of this technology remain. This review presents an overview of the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and ML integration into asthma management by providing a snapshot of the existing scientific evidence and proposing potential avenues for future applications.

Abstract: There is growing demand for emergency-based eyecare services where the majority of those attending do not require urgent ophthalmic management. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists have recommended upskilling and supporting of allied health professionals to support eyecare delivery, where machine learning algorithms could help. A mixed methods study was conducted to evaluate the usability of an artificial intelligence (AI) powered online triage platform for ophthalmology. The interface, usability, safety and acceptability were investigated using a Think Aloud interview and usability questionnaires. Twenty participants who actively examine patients in ophthalmic triage within a tertiary eye centre or primary care setting completed the interview and questionnaires. 90% or more of participants found the platform easy to use, reflected their triage process and were able to interpret the triage outcome, 85% found it safe to use and 95% felt the processing time was fast. A quarter of clinicians reported that they have experienced some uncertainty when triaging in their career and were unsure of using AI, after this study 95% of clinicians were willing to use the platform in their clinical workflow. This study showed the platform interface was acceptable and usable for clinicians actively working in ophthalmic emergency triage.

Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: A drop in physical activity and a deterioration in the capacity to undertake daily life activities are both connected with ageing and have negative effects on physical and mental health. An Elderly and Visually Impaired Human Activity Monitoring (EV-HAM) system that keeps tabs on a person's routine and steps in if a change in behaviour or a crisis might greatly help an elderly person or a visually impaired. These individuals may find greater freedom with the help of an EVHAM system. As the backbone of human-centric applications like actively supported living and in-home monitoring for the elderly and visually impaired, an EVHAM system is essential. Big data-driven product design is flourishing in this age of 5G and the IoT. Recent advancements in processing power and software architectures have also contributed to the emergence and development of artificial intelligence (AI). In this context, the digital twin has emerged as a state-of-the-art technology that bridges the gap between the real and virtual worlds by evaluating data from several sensors using artificial intelligence algorithms. Although promising findings have been reported by Wi-Fi-based human activity identification techniques so far, their effectiveness is vulnerable to environmental variations. Using the environment-independent fingerprints generated from the Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI), we introduce Wi-Sense. This human activity identification system employs a Deep Hybrid convolutional neural network (DHCNN). The proposed system begins by collecting the CSI with a regular Wi-Fi Network Interface Controller. Wi-Sense uses the CSI ratio technique to lessen the effect of noise and the phase offset. The t- Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is used to eliminate unnecessary data further. The data dimension is decreased, and the negative effects on the environment are eliminated in this process. The resulting spectrogram of the processed data exposes the activity's micro-Doppler fingerprints as a function of both time and location. These spectrograms are put to use in the training of a DHCNN. Based on our findings, EVHAM can accurately identify these actions 99% of the time.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Based Emphysema Quantification in Routine Chest Computed Tomography: Correlation With Spirometry and Visual Emphysema Grading.
Author: ['Wiedbrauck D', 'Karczewski M', 'Schoenberg SO', 'Fink C', 'Kayed H']
Journal Title: Journal of computer assisted tomography
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 18
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to assess the correlation between artificial intelligence (AI)-based low attenuation volume percentage (LAV%) with forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and visual emphysema grades in routine chest computed tomography (CT). Furthermore, optimal LAV% cutoff values for predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70% or moderate to more extensive visual emphysema grades were calculated. METHODS: In a retrospective study of 298 consecutive patients who underwent routine chest CT and spirometry examinations, LAV% was quantified using an AI-based software with a threshold < -950 HU. The FEV1/FVC was derived from spirometry, with FEV1/FVC < 70% indicating airway obstruction. The mean time interval of CT from spirometry was 3.87 +/- 4.78 days. Severity of emphysema was visually graded by an experienced chest radiologist using an established 5-grade ordinal scale (Fleischner Society classification system). Spearman correlation coefficient between LAV% and FEV1/FVC was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic determined the optimal LAV% cutoff values for predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70% or a visual emphysema grade of moderate or higher (Fleischner grade 3-5). RESULTS: Significant correlation between LAV% and FEV1/FVC was found (varrho = -0.477, P < 0.001). Increasing LAV% corresponded to higher visual emphysema grades. For patients with absent visual emphysema, mean LAV% was 2.98 +/- 3.30, for patients with trace emphysema 3.22 +/- 2.75, for patients with mild emphysema 3.90 +/- 3.33, for patients with moderate emphysema 6.41 +/- 3.46, for patients with confluent emphysema 9.02 +/- 5.45, and for patients with destructive emphysema 16.90 +/- 8.19. Optimal LAV% cutoff value for predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70 was 6.1 (area under the curve = 0.764, sensitivity = 0.773, specificity = 0.665), while for predicting a visual emphysema grade of moderate or higher, it was 4.7 (area under the curve = 0.802, sensitivity = 0.766, specificity = 0.742). Furthermore, correlation between visual emphysema grading and FEV1/FVC was found. In patients with FEV1/FVC < 70% a high proportion of subjects had emphysema grade 3 (moderate) or higher, whereas in patients with FEV1/FVC >/= 70%, a larger proportion had emphysema grade 3 (moderate) or lower. The sensitivity for visual emphysema grading predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70% was 56.3% with an optimal cutoff point at a visual grade of 4 (confluent), demonstrating a lower sensitivity compared with LAV% (77.3%). CONCLUSIONS: A significant correlation between AI-based LAV% and FEV1/FVC as well as visual CT emphysema grades can be found in routine chest CT suggesting that AI-based LAV% measurement might be integrated as an add-on functional parameter in the evaluation of chest CT in the future.

Author: ['Chang M', 'Zhang L', 'Wang Z', 'Chen L', 'Dong Y', 'Yang J', 'Chen Y']
Journal Title: Advanced drug delivery reviews
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 17
Abstract: The advent of numerous treatment modalities with desirable therapeutic efficacy has been made possible by the fast development of nanomedicine and materdicine, among which the ultrasound (US)-triggered sonocatalytic process as minimal or non-invasive method has been frequently employed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In comparison to phototherapeutic approaches with inherent penetration depth limitations, sonocatalytic therapy shatters the depth limit of photoactivation and offers numerous remarkable prospects and advantages, including mitigated side effects and appropriate tissue-penetration depth. Nevertheless, the optimization of sonosensitizers and therapies remains a significant issue in terms of precision, intelligence and efficiency. In light of the fact that nanomedicine and materdicine can effectively enhance the theranostic efficiency, we herein aim to furnish a cutting-edge review on the latest progress and development of nanomedicine/materdicine-enabled sonocatalytic therapy. The design methodologies and biological features of nanomedicine/materdicine-based sonosensitizers are initially introduced to reveal the underlying relationship between composition/structure, sonocatalytic function and biological effect, in accompany with a thorough discussion of nanomedicine/materdicine-enabled synergistic therapy. Ultimately, the facing challenges and future perspectives of this intriguing sonocatalytic therapy are highlighted and outlined to promote technological advancements and clinical translation in efficient disease treatment.

Author: ['Demura M', 'Nakajima R', 'Tanaka S', 'Kinoshita M', 'Nakada M']
Journal Title: World neurosurgery
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 16
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Mentalizing is an essential function of our social lives. Impairment of mentalizing due to meningiomas has not received attention because most patients return to their social lives after surgical treatment. We investigated the influence of meningiomas and their surgical resection on mentalizing. METHODS: Low- and high-level mentalizing were retrospectively examined in 61 patients with meningiomas and 14 healthy volunteers. Mentalizing was assessed using the facial expression recognition test and picture arrangement test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition, before and after surgery. We examined the influence of tumor localization on mentalizing and recovery from mentalizing disorders after tumor resection. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was performed to investigate the relationship between impairments in mentalizing and tumor location. RESULTS: Before surgery, mentalizing was impaired significantly in patients with meningiomas compared to those in the control group (low-level: P = 0.015, high-level: P = 0.011). This impairment was associated with contact between the tumor and frontal lobe (low-level: P = 0.036, high-level: P = 0.047) and was severe in patients with tumors arising in the anterior skull base (low-level: P = 0.0045, high-level: P = 0.043). Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that when the basal cortex of the frontal lobe was compressed by the tumor, the risk of impaired mentalizing was high. The region responsible for high-level mentalizing was located deeper than that responsible for low-level mentalizing. After the surgical removal of the tumor, the test scores significantly improved (low-level: P = 0.035, high-level: P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Mentalizing was impaired by meningiomas arising from the anterior skull base, but it can improve after surgical resection of the tumors.

Abstract: Medical training programs and healthcare systems collect ever-increasing amounts of educational and clinical data. These data are collected with the primary purpose of supporting either trainee learning or patient care. Well-established principles guide the secondary use of these data for program evaluation and quality improvement initiatives. More recently, however, these clinical and educational data are also increasingly being used to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. The implications of this relatively unique secondary use of data have not been well explored. These models can support the development of sophisticated AI products that can be commercialized. While these products have the potential to support and improve the educational system, there are challenges related to validity; patient and learner consent; and biased or discriminatory outputs. The authors consider the implications of developing AI models and products using educational and clinical data from learners, discuss the uses of these products within medical education, and outline considerations that should guide the appropriate use of data for this purpose. These issues are further explored by examining how they have been navigated in an educational collaborative.

Abstract: Clinical touch is the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship and can impact patient experience and outcomes. In the current era, driven by an ever-increasing infusion of point of care technologies, physical exam skills have become undervalued. Moreover, touch and hands-on skills have been difficult to teach due to inaccurate assessments and difficulty with learning transfer through observation. In this article, the authors argue that haptics, the science of touch, provides a unique opportunity to explore new pathways to facilitate touch training. Furthermore, haptics can dramatically increase the density of touch-based assessments without increasing human rater burden-essential for realizing precision assessment. The science of haptics is reviewed, including the benefits of using haptics-informed language for objective structured clinical examinations. The authors describe how haptic devices and haptic language have and can be used to facilitate learning, communication, documentation and a much-needed reinvigoration of physical examination and touch excellence at the point of care. The synergy of haptic devices, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality environments are discussed. The authors conclude with challenges of scaling haptic technology in medical education, such as cost and translational needs, and opportunities to achieve wider adoption of this transformative approach to precision education.
