Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frailty indicators can operate in dynamic amalgamations of disease conditions, clinical symptoms, biomarkers, medical signals, cognitive characteristics, and even health beliefs and practices. This study is the first to evaluate which, among these multiple frailty-related indicators, are important and differential predictors of clinical cohorts that represent progression along an Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. We applied machine-learning technology to such indicators in order to identify the leading predictors of three AD spectrum cohorts; viz., subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. The common benchmark was a cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. METHODS: The four cohorts were from the cross-sectional Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia dataset. We used random forest analysis (Python 3.7) to simultaneously test the relative importance of 83 multi-modal frailty indicators in discriminating the cohorts. We performed an explainable artificial intelligence method (Tree Shapley Additive exPlanation values) for deep interpretation of prediction effects. RESULTS: We observed strong concurrent prediction results, with clusters varying across cohorts. The SCI model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). Three leading predictors were poorer quality of life ([QoL]; memory), abnormal lymphocyte count, and abnormal neutrophil count. The MCI model demonstrated a similarly high AUC (0.88). Five leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory, leisure), male sex, abnormal lymphocyte count, and poorer self-rated eyesight. The AD model demonstrated outstanding prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.98). Ten leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory), reduced olfaction, male sex, increased dependence in activities of daily living (n = 6), and poorer visual contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Both convergent and cohort-specific frailty factors discriminated the AD spectrum cohorts. Convergence was observed as all cohorts were marked by lower quality of life (memory), supporting recent research and clinical attention to subjective experiences of memory aging and their potentially broad ramifications. Diversity was displayed in that, of the 14 leading predictors extracted across models, 11 were selectively sensitive to one cohort. A morbidity intensity trend was indicated by an increasing number and diversity of predictors corresponding to clinical severity, especially in AD. Knowledge of differential deficit predictors across AD clinical cohorts may promote precision interventions.

Title: Image-based AI diagnostic performance for fatty liver: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Author: ['Zhao Q', 'Lan Y', 'Yin X', 'Wang K']
Journal Title: BMC medical imaging
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The gold standard to diagnose fatty liver is pathology. Recently, image-based artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to have high diagnostic performance. We systematically reviewed studies of image-based AI in the diagnosis of fatty liver. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase and assessed the quality of included studies by QUADAS-AI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) were generated to identify the diagnostic accuracy of AI models. RESULTS: 15 studies were selected in our meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% CI: 90-93%) and 94% (95% CI: 93-96%), PLR and NLR were 12.67 (95% CI: 7.65-20.98) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06-0.13), DOR was 182.36 (95% CI: 94.85-350.61). After subgroup analysis by AI algorithm (conventional machine learning/deep learning), region, reference (US, MRI or pathology), imaging techniques (MRI or US) and transfer learning, the model also demonstrated acceptable diagnostic efficacy. CONCLUSION: AI has satisfactory performance in the diagnosis of fatty liver by medical imaging. The integration of AI into imaging devices may produce effective diagnostic tools, but more high-quality studies are needed for further evaluation.

Title: Severity of error in hierarchical datasets.
Author: ['Srivastava S', 'Mishra D']
Journal Title: Scientific reports
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: Classification tasks today, especially for the medical domain, use datasets which are often hierarchical. These tasks are approached using methods that consider the class taxonomy for predicting a label. The classifiers are gradually becoming increasingly accurate over the complex datasets. While increasing accuracy is a good way to judge a model, in high-risk applications, it needs to be ensured that even if the model makes a mistake, it does not bear a severe consequence. This work explores the concept of severity of an error and extends it to the medical domain. Further, it aims to point out that accuracy or AUROC alone are not sufficient metrics to decide the performance of a model in a setting where a misclassification will incur a severe cost. Various approaches to reduce severity for classification models are compared and evaluated in this work, which indicate that while many of them might be suited for a traditional image classification setting, there is a need for techniques tailored toward tasks and settings of medical domain to push artificial intelligence in healthcare to a deployable state.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are immune-mediated conditions that are increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide. Their assessment and monitoring are becoming increasingly important, though complex. The best disease control is achieved through tight monitoring of objective inflammatory parameters (such as serum and stool inflammatory markers), cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic assessment. Considering the complexity of the information obtained throughout a patient's journey, artificial intelligence (AI) provides an ideal adjunct to existing tools to help diagnose, monitor and predict the course of disease of patients with IBD. Therefore, we propose a scoping review assessing AI's role in diagnosis, monitoring and prognostication tools in patients with IBD. We aim to detect gaps in the literature and address them in future research endeavours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore. Two reviewers will independently screen the abstracts and titles first and then perform the full-text review. A third reviewer will resolve any conflict. We will include both observational studies and clinical trials. Study characteristics will be extracted using a data extraction form. The extracted data will be summarised in a tabular format, following the imaging modality theme and the study outcome assessed. The results will have an accompanying narrative review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Considering the nature of the project, ethical review by an institutional review board is not required. The data will be presented at academic conferences, and the final product will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Title: Compassion in action: Exploring the relationship between nurse conscientious intelligence and palliative care.
Author: ['Ozden G', 'Parlar Kilic S']
Journal Title: Nursing in critical care
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: BACKGORUND: Conscience is a concept that is the foundation of nursing, guiding nurses to ethical practices, and helping them to provide the best professional care possible. Conscience enables nurses to be understanding and careful in patient care. AIM: The study had three aims: (1) to determine the level of conscientious intelligence and palliative care practice of intensive care nurses; (2) to determine the effect of sociodemographic and occupational variables on conscientious intelligence and palliative care practices; and (3) to examine the relationship between conscientious intelligence and palliative care practice. METHODS: This study was designed as a descriptive-correlative study. The sample consisted of 157 nurses from a university hospital. The data were collected using questionnaire form, Conscientious Intelligence Scale and the Palliative Care Self-Reported Practices Scale between February and March 2021. RESULTS: By the general multivariate linear model, while age, educational level, professional experience, total term of employment in the clinic, and training in palliative care were important predictors of palliative care practices, age and gender were significant predictors of conscientious intelligence. It was concluded that the level of palliative care practice of intensive care nurses with a high level of conscientiousness was also higher. CONCLUSION: The conscientious intelligence levels of intensive care nurses positively affected palliative care practices. It can be said that it is important for nurses to combine their conscience with their professional knowledge and skills while providing care services. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the realm of nursing, it is imperative for professionals to not only possess knowledge and competence, but also to act with conscience when caring for patients. This study demonstrated that nurses with heightened conscientious awareness are more adept at providing palliative care. Consequently, it is vital to support practices and training that foster conscientiousness among nurses, who must exercise patience and diligence in their careers.

Title: Experiences of using artificial intelligence in healthcare: a qualitative study of UK clinician and key stakeholder perspectives.
Author: ['Fazakarley CA', 'Breen M', 'Leeson P', 'Thompson B', 'Williamson V']
Journal Title: BMJ open
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field in healthcare, with tools being developed across various specialties to support healthcare professionals and reduce workloads. It is important to understand the experiences of professionals working in healthcare to ensure that future AI tools are acceptable and effectively implemented. The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the experiences and perceptions of UK healthcare workers and other key stakeholders about the use of AI in the National Health Service (NHS). DESIGN: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews conducted remotely via MS Teams. Thematic analysis was carried out. SETTING: NHS and UK higher education institutes. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen participants were recruited, including clinical and non-clinical participants working for the NHS and researchers working to develop AI tools for healthcare settings. RESULTS: Four core themes were identified: positive perceptions of AI; potential barriers to using AI in healthcare; concerns regarding AI use and steps needed to ensure the acceptability of future AI tools. Overall, we found that those working in healthcare were generally open to the use of AI and expected it to have many benefits for patients and facilitate access to care. However, concerns were raised regarding the security of patient data, the potential for misdiagnosis and that AI could increase the burden on already strained healthcare staff. CONCLUSION: This study found that healthcare staff are willing to engage with AI research and incorporate AI tools into care pathways. Going forward, the NHS and AI developers will need to collaborate closely to ensure that future tools are suitable for their intended use and do not negatively impact workloads or patient trust. Future AI studies should continue to incorporate the views of key stakeholders to improve tool acceptability. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05028179; ISRCTN15113915; IRAS ref: 293515.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To develop, test, validate and implement a system dynamics model to simulate the pandemic progress and the impact of various interventions on viral spread, healthcare utilisation and demand in secondary care. DESIGN: We adopted the system dynamics model incorporating susceptible, exposed, infection and recovery framework to simulate the progress of the pandemic and how the interventions for the COVID-19 response influence the outcomes with a focus on secondary care. SETTING: This study was carried out covering all the local health systems in Southeast of England with a catchment population of six million with a specific focus on Kent and Medway system. PARTICIPANTS: Six local health systems in Southeast of England using Kent and Medway as a case study. INTERVENTIONS: Short to medium 'what if' scenarios incorporating human behaviour, non-pharmaceutical interventions and medical interventions were tested using the model with regular and continuous feedback of the model results to the local health system leaders for monitoring, planning and rapid response as needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily output from the model which included number infected in the population, hospital admissions needing COVID-19 care, occupied general beds, continuous positive airway pressure beds, intensive care beds, hospital discharge pathways and deaths. RESULTS: We successfully implemented a regional series of models based on the local population needs which were used in healthcare planning as part of the pandemic response. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have demonstrated the utility of system dynamics modelling incorporating local intelligence and collaborative working during the pandemic to respond rapidly and take decisions to protect the population. This led to strengthened cooperation among partners and ensured that the local population healthcare needs were met.

Author: ['Park Y', 'Han J', 'Leikin S', 'Diaz-Gomez JL']
Journal Title: Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 9
Abstract: To assess POCUS in 2024, we should start by defining its expanded scope and integration into general and specialty practice. Clinicians should abide by the evolving evidence for POCUS utilization and patient outcomes different from mortality and morbidity, especially as there are notable advancements in handheld ultrasound technology with a clear shift from capability to portability. To reduce diagnostic errors, POCUS practitioners need a holistic framework that accounts for known and new applications. Defining the POCUS scope of practices, proper training, and innovation, like artificial intelligence, can play a bigger role in mitigating diagnostic errors as we move forward.

Publication Date: 2023 Dec 8
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS) is a rare syndrome associated with cognitive and behavioural regression. On the basis of mostly small observational and retrospective studies, corticosteroids and clobazam are often considered the most effective treatments for this syndrome. We aimed to compare cognitive outcomes of children with EE-SWAS 6 months after starting treatment with either corticosteroids or clobazam. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised controlled trial at eight tertiary referral centres for rare epilepsies in seven European countries. Children were eligible to participate if they were aged 2-12 years, were diagnosed with EE-SWAS within 6 months before inclusion, and had not been treated with corticosteroids or clobazam previously. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with corticosteroids (either continuous treatment with 1-2 mg/kg per day of prednisolone orally or pulse treatment with 20 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days every 4 weeks) or clobazam (0.5-1.2 mg/kg per day orally). The primary outcome was cognitive functioning after 6 months of treatment, which was assessed by either the intelligence quotient (IQ) responder rate (defined as improvement of >/=11.25 IQ points) or the cognitive sum score responder rate (defined as improvement of >/=0.75 points). Safety was assessed by number of adverse events and serious adverse events. Data were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all children as randomised who had primary outcome data available at 6 months. The trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register, Toetsingonline, NL43510.041.13, and the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN42686094. The trial was terminated prematurely because enrolment of the predefined number of 130 participants was deemed not feasible. FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2014, and Sept 3, 2022, 45 children were randomly assigned to either corticosteroids (n=22) or clobazam (n=23); two children assigned clobazam dropped out before 6 months and were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis. At the 6-month assessment, an improvement of 11.25 IQ points or greater was reported for five (25%) of 20 children assigned corticosteroids versus zero (0%) of 18 assigned clobazam (risk ratio [RR] 10.0, 95% CI 1.2-1310.4; p=0.025). An improvement of 0.75 points or more in the cognitive sum score was recorded for one (5%) of 22 children assigned corticosteroids versus one (5%) of 21 children assigned clobazam (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.1-11.7, p=0.97). Adverse events occurred in ten (45%) of 22 children who received corticosteroids, most frequently weight gain, and in 11 (52%) of 21 children who received clobazam, most often fatigue and behavioural disturbances. Occurrence of adverse events did not differ between groups (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.4; p=0.65). Serious adverse events occurred in one child in the corticosteroid group (hospitalisation due to laryngitis) and in two children in the clobazam group (hospitalisation due to seizure aggravation, and respiratory tract infection). No deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: The trial was terminated prematurely, and the target sample size was not met, so our findings must be interpreted with caution. Our data indicated an improvement in IQ outcomes with corticosteroids compared with clobazam treatment, but no difference was seen in cognitive sum score. Our findings strengthen those from previous uncontrolled studies that support the early use of corticosteroids for children with EE-SWAS.

Title: U-Net-Based Assistive Identification of Bladder Cancer: A Promising Approach for Improved Diagnosisc.
Author: ['Guo Y', 'Li C', 'Zhang S', 'Zhu G', 'Sun L', 'Jin T', 'Wang Z', 'Li S', 'Zhou F']
Journal Title: Urologia internationalis
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 11
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer (BC) is a major health concern that poses a significant threat to the population, with an increasing incidence rate and a high risk of recurrence and progression. The primary clinical method for diagnosing bladder cancer is cystoscopy, but due to the limitations of traditional white light cystoscopy and inadequate clinical experience among junior physicians, its detection rate for bladder tumor, especially small and flat lesions, is relatively low. However, recent years have seen remarkable advancements in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the field of medicine. This has led to the development of numerous AI algorithms that have been successfully integrated into medical practices, providing valuable assistance to clinicians. The purpose of this study is to develop a cystoscopy algorithm that is real-time, cost-effective, high-performing, and accurate, with the aim of enhancing the detection rate of bladder tumors during cystoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, a dataset of 3500 cystoscopic images obtained from 100 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer was collected, and a deep learning model was developed utilizing the U-Net algorithm within a convolutional neural network for training purposes. RESULTS: This study randomly divided 3,500 images from 100 bladder cancer patients into training and validation groups, and each patient's pathology result was confirmed. In the validation group, the accuracy of tumor recognition by the U-Net algorithm reached 98%. Compared to primary urologists, with greater accuracy and faster detection speed. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of U-Net-based deep learning techniques in the detection of bladder tumors. The establishment and optimization of the U-Net model is a significant breakthrough and it provides a valuable reference for future research in the field of medical image processing.

Journal Title: Journal of chemical information and modeling
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 25
Abstract: The application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the field of chemistry has garnered growing interest for its potential to justify the prediction of black-box machine learning models and provide actionable insights. We first survey a range of XAI techniques adapted for chemical applications and categorize them based on the technical details of each methodology. We then present a few case studies to illustrate the practical utility of XAI, such as identifying carcinogenic molecules and guiding molecular optimizations, in order to provide chemists with concrete examples of ways to take full advantage of XAI-augmented machine learning for chemistry. Despite the initial success of XAI in chemistry, we still face the challenges of developing more reliable explanations, assuring robustness against adversarial actions, and customizing the explanation for different applications and needs of the diverse scientific community. Finally, we discuss the emerging role of large language models like GPT in generating natural language explanations and discusses the specific challenges associated with them. We advocate that addressing the aforementioned challenges and actively embracing new techniques may contribute to establishing machine learning as an indispensable technique for chemistry in this digital era.

Title: Emergence and collapse of reciprocity in semiautomatic driving coordination experiments with humans.
Author: ['Shirado H', 'Kasahara S', 'Christakis NA']
Journal Title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Publication Date: 2023 Dec 19
Abstract: Forms of both simple and complex machine intelligence are increasingly acting within human groups in order to affect collective outcomes. Considering the nature of collective action problems, however, such involvement could paradoxically and unintentionally suppress existing beneficial social norms in humans, such as those involving cooperation. Here, we test theoretical predictions about such an effect using a unique cyber-physical lab experiment where online participants (N = 300 in 150 dyads) drive robotic vehicles remotely in a coordination game. We show that autobraking assistance increases human altruism, such as giving way to others, and that communication helps people to make mutual concessions. On the other hand, autosteering assistance completely inhibits the emergence of reciprocity between people in favor of self-interest maximization. The negative social repercussions persist even after the assistance system is deactivated. Furthermore, adding communication capabilities does not relieve this inhibition of reciprocity because people rarely communicate in the presence of autosteering assistance. Our findings suggest that active safety assistance (a form of simple AI support) can alter the dynamics of social coordination between people, including by affecting the trade-off between individual safety and social reciprocity. The difference between autobraking and autosteering assistance appears to relate to whether the assistive technology supports or replaces human agency in social coordination dilemmas. Humans have developed norms of reciprocity to address collective challenges, but such tacit understandings could break down in situations where machine intelligence is involved in human decision-making without having any normative commitments.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Varenicline is a pharmacological intervention for tobacco dependence that is safe and effective in facilitating smoking cessation. Enhanced adherence to varenicline augments the probability of prolonged smoking abstinence. However, research has shown that one-third of people who use varenicline are nonadherent by the second week. There is evidence showing that behavioral support helps with medication adherence. We have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) conversational agent or health bot, called "ChatV," based on evidence of what works as well as what varenicline is, that can provide these supports. ChatV is an evidence-based, patient- and health care provider-informed health bot to improve adherence to varenicline. ChatV has been programmed to provide medication reminders, answer questions about varenicline and smoking cessation, and track medication intake and the number of cigarettes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the feasibility of the ChatV health bot, to examine if it is used as intended, and to determine the appropriateness of proceeding with a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We will conduct a mixed methods feasibility study where we will pilot-test ChatV with 40 participants. Participants will be provided with a standard 12-week varenicline regimen and access to ChatV. Passive data collection will include adoption measures (how often participants use the chatbot, what features they used, when did they use it, etc). In addition, participants will complete questionnaires (at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks) assessing self-reported smoking status and varenicline adherence, as well as questions regarding the acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of the chatbot, and participate in an interview assessing acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, and adoption. We will use "stop, amend, and go" progression criteria for pilot studies to decide if a randomized controlled trial is a reasonable next step and what modifications are required. A health equity lens will be adopted during participant recruitment and data analysis to understand and address the differences in uptake and use of this digital health solution among diverse sociodemographic groups. The taxonomy of implementation outcomes will be used to assess feasibility, that is, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, adoption, and usability. In addition, medication adherence and smoking cessation will be measured to assess the preliminary treatment effect. Interview data will be analyzed using the framework analysis method. RESULTS: Participant enrollment for the study will begin in January 2024. CONCLUSIONS: By using predetermined progression criteria, the results of this preliminary study will inform the determination of whether to advance toward a larger randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the health bot. Additionally, this study will explore the acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, adoption, and usability of the health bot. These insights will be instrumental in refining the intervention and the health bot. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05997901; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05997901.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Emotional intelligence (EI) has improved job performance and has been associated with the success of individuals. The interfering role of happiness in this equation is unneglectable; however, this association has not been established in clinical medical students exposed to work pressures and stressful hospital atmospheric. The present perusal was conducted to evaluate the relationship between EI and happiness in clinical medical students. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional investigation was conducted in Iran from December 2021 to June 2022. Multi-stage cluster sampling followed by a systematic random selection was applied to choose participants. Data gathering was carried out online by Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale-10 and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Data from 405 participants were analyzed. The mean age was 24.2 years; men and women constituted 208 (51.4%) and 197 (48.6%) of all participants. Gamma regression analysis has determined age (Exp (B) = 1.016, p-value < 0.001), female gender (Exp (B) = 0.966, p-value = 0.04), extrovert personality (Exp (B) = 1.076, p-value < 0.001), perceived somatic health (Exp (B) = 1.002, p-value < 0.001), and stress level (Exp (B) = 0.990, p-value = 0.01) as predictors of happiness. EI comprises five domains, and except for appraisal of others' emotions, an increase in all other domains of emotional intelligence was associated with higher happiness. GBRT model of significant variables revealed regulation of own emotions is the most happiness-predictor variable (Exp (B) = 1.042, p-value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Diminishing the stresses helps medical students have a happier life. In happiness-boosting strategies, vulnerable individuals (women, introverts, and those of higher age) ought to be noted as the targeted population. In this investigation, emotional intelligence was the most effective predictor of happiness in clinical medical students. Planning to promote happiness in these medical staff by enhancing their EI leads to better decision-making and more prosperity in their job, resulting in better patient care services.

Journal Title: Frontiers in psychology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Those who are professionally dedicated to teaching can be exposed with their work to situations that influence their perception of psychological well-being. This study aims to evaluate how the factors of personality, emotional intelligence, burnout and the psychosocial climate derived from the work environment of teachers influence their levels of psychological well-being, to verify whether these variables allow us to establish a predictive model of psychological well-being by means of multiple regression analysis. METHODS: Participants were a group of 386 teachers in early childhood, Primary and Secondary education, both in training and in active service (71.5% women; 28.5% men). A correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed to establish a predictive model of psychological well-being. We used 5 instruments: Psychosocial Climate at Work Scales (ECPT); verall Personality Assessment Scale (OPERAS); Questionnaire for Evaluation of Burnout Syndrome at Work (CESQT); Spanish adaptation of the Riff Psychological Well-being Scales (EBP) and Spanish validation of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). RESULTS: Most of the relationships were significant, and the multiple regression analysis explains 58.5% of the global variance of psychological well-being in teachers, being emotional stability the most relevant and main predictor of psychological well-being, explaining its 38.1%. DISCUSSION: Personality shows a great influence in psychological well-being of teachers, particularly emotional stability. The ability to establish predictive models to explain psychological well-being in educational environments is confirmed.

Journal Title: Frontiers in psychology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is gradually penetrating the domain of education, opening up many possibilities for teaching and learning. Many educators, faced with the burden of commenting on substantial student essays, have introduced automated writing evaluation (AWE) into second language (L2) writing considering its affordance of immediate scores and diagnostic information. However, students' processing strategies and perceptions of such computer-generated feedback and its impact on student writing quality, particularly as mediated by language proficiency, remain under-explored. This study examines the impact of Pigai, a Chinese AWE system, on revision processes and writing products of 42 English as a foreign language (EFL) learners with varying language levels by analyzing feedback points, feedback uptake, text quality in complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF), and perceptions. The findings are as follows. When confronted with AWE instruction, the majority of student work focuses on correcting errors, but higher-level students exhibit an emphasis on language improvement beyond the surface level compared to lower-level students. According to CAF measures, automated feedback exerts greater effects on accuracy for unskilled learners and lexical complexity for skilled learners in the development of interlanguage. Learner profiles and perceptions of students at different levels are explored along four dimensions: writing quality, cognitive engagement, behavioral engagement, and affective engagement. Finally, the potential issues of such technology-based writing instruction are pointed out.

Title: AI voices reduce cognitive activity? A psychophysiological study of the media effect of AI and human newscasts in Chinese journalism.
Author: ['Gong C']
Journal Title: Frontiers in psychology
Publication Date: 2023
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely utilized in automated journalism writing and broadcasting in recent years. However, few systematic studies have been conducted on the differences in brain activation between human and artificial voices in newscasts. This paper aims to investigate the psychophysiological effects of the media in Chinese contexts when different agents (AI or human) broadcast different types (emotional/neutral) of news. Comparing the electrophysiological data of the participants' EEG while listening to different newscast agents revealed that brain activity responses were greater when listening to a human newscast than to an AI voice newscast. And beta bands in left posterior temporal lobe were significantly different, suggesting that participants' brain were better at processing, comprehending auditory information, and storing working memory when listening to a human reporter than when listening to a voice generated by AI. Moreover, the ERP results and the interaction effect of content valence and agent voice demonstrated that the human voice generated greater cognitive effect, which may reflect participants' trust in the credibility and fluency of the human voice news. This study demonstrates the importance of further research into cognitive effects of AI journalism.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting colorectal neoplasia during colonoscopy holds the potential to enhance adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and reduce adenoma miss rates (AMRs). However, varied outcomes have been observed across studies. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of employing AI-aided systems during colonoscopy. METHODS: Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords, a comprehensive electronic literature search was performed of the Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Library databases from the inception of each database until October 04, 2023, in order to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing AI-assisted with standard colonoscopy for detecting colorectal neoplasia. Primary outcomes included AMR, ADR, and adenomas detected per colonoscopy (APC). Secondary outcomes comprised the poly missed detection rate (PMR), poly detection rate (PDR), and poly detected per colonoscopy (PPC). We utilized random-effects meta-analyses with Hartung-Knapp adjustment to consolidate results. The prediction interval (PI) and I(2) statistics were utilized to quantify between-study heterogeneity. Moreover, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023428658). FINDINGS: This study encompassed 33 trials involving 27,404 patients. Those undergoing AI-aided colonoscopy experienced a significant decrease in PMR (RR, 0.475; 95% CI, 0.294-0.768; I(2) = 87.49%) and AMR (RR, 0.495; 95% CI, 0.390-0.627; I(2) = 48.76%). Additionally, a significant increase in PDR (RR, 1.238; 95% CI, 1.158-1.323; I(2) = 81.67%) and ADR (RR, 1.242; 95% CI, 1.159-1.332; I(2) = 78.87%), along with a significant increase in the rates of PPC (IRR, 1.388; 95% CI, 1.270-1.517; I(2) = 91.99%) and APC (IRR, 1.390; 95% CI, 1.277-1.513; I(2) = 86.24%), was observed. This resulted in 0.271 more PPCs (95% CI, 0.144-0.259; I(2) = 65.61%) and 0.202 more APCs (95% CI, 0.144-0.259; I(2) = 68.15%). INTERPRETATION: AI-aided colonoscopy significantly enhanced the detection of colorectal neoplasia detection, likely by reducing the miss rate. However, future studies should focus on evaluating the cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits of AI-aided colonoscopy in reducing cancer incidence.

Journal Title: Cell reports. Physical science
Publication Date: 2023 Nov
Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT can generate authentic-seeming text at lightning speed, but many journal publishers reject language models as authors on manuscripts. Thus, a means to accurately distinguish human-generated from artificial intelligence (AI)-generated text is immediately needed. We recently developed an accurate AI text detector for scientific journals and, herein, test its ability in a variety of challenging situations, including on human text from a wide variety of chemistry journals, on AI text from the most advanced publicly available language model (GPT-4), and, most important, on AI text generated using prompts designed to obfuscate AI use. In all cases, AI and human text was assigned with high accuracy. ChatGPT-generated text can be readily detected in chemistry journals; this advance is a fundamental prerequisite for understanding how automated text generation will impact scientific publishing from now into the future.
