TI  - ChatGPT in action: Harnessing artificial intelligence potential and addressing 
      ethical challenges in medicine, education, and scientific research.
PG  - 170-178
LID - 10.5662/wjm.v13.i4.170 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformer (ChatGPT), hold considerable potential in healthcare, academia, and 
      diverse industries. Evidence demonstrates its capability at a medical student 
      level in standardized tests, suggesting utility in medical education, radiology 
      reporting, genetics research, data optimization, and drafting repetitive texts 
      such as discharge summaries. Nevertheless, these tools should augment, not 
      supplant, human expertise. Despite promising applications, ChatGPT confronts 
      limitations, including critical thinking tasks and generating false references, 
      necessitating stringent cross-verification. Ensuing concerns, such as potential 
      misuse, bias, blind trust, and privacy, underscore the need for transparency, 
      accountability, and clear policies. Evaluations of AI-generated content and 
      preservation of academic integrity are critical. With responsible use, AI can 
      significantly improve healthcare, academia, and industry without compromising 
      integrity and research quality. For effective and ethical AI deployment, 
      collaboration amongst AI developers, researchers, educators, and policymakers is 
      vital. The development of domain-specific tools, guidelines, regulations, and the 
      facilitation of public dialogue must underpin these endeavors to responsibly 
      harness AI's potential.

TI  - Opportunities for digital health technology: identifying unmet needs for bipolar 
      misdiagnosis and depression care management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital health technologies (DHTs) driven by artificial 
      intelligence applications, particularly those including predictive models derived 
      with machine learning methods, have garnered substantial attention and financial 
      investment in recent years. Yet, there is little evidence of widespread adoption 
      and scant proof of gains in patient health outcomes. One factor of this paradox 
      is the disconnect between DHT developers and digital health ecosystem 
      stakeholders, which can result in developing technologies that are highly 
      sophisticated but clinically irrelevant. Here, we aimed to uncover challenges 
      faced by psychiatrists treating patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). 
      Specifically, we focused on challenges psychiatrists raised about bipolar 
      disorder (BD) misdiagnosis. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 
      10 United States-based psychiatrists. We applied text and thematic analysis to 
      the resulting interview transcripts. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) BD 
      is often misdiagnosed, (2) information crucial to evaluating BD is often occluded 
      from clinical observation, and (3) BD misdiagnosis has important treatment 
      implications. DISCUSSION: Using upstream stakeholder engagement methods, we were 
      able to identify a narrow, unforeseen, and clinically relevant problem. We 
      propose an organizing framework for development of digital tools based upon 
      clinician-identified unmet need.

TI  - Synchrotron microtomography reveals insights into the degradation kinetics of 
      bio-degradable coronary magnesium scaffolds.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1016/j.bioactmat.2023.09.008 [doi]
AB  - Bioresorbable magnesium scaffolds are a promising future treatment option for 
      coronary artery stenosis, especially for young adults. Due to the degradation of 
      these scaffolds (<1 year), long-term device-related clinical events could be 
      reduced compared to treatments with conventional drug eluting stents. First 
      clinical trials indicate a return of vasomotion after one year, which may be 
      associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes. However, even after decades 
      of development, the degradation process, ideal degradation time and biological 
      response in vivo are still not fully understood. The present study investigates 
      the in vivo degradation of magnesium scaffolds in the coronary arteries of pigs 
      influenced by different strut thicknesses and the presence of antiproliferative 
      drugs. Due to high 3D image contrast of synchrotron-based micro-CT with phase 
      contrast (SR-μCT), a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the degradation 
      morphology of magnesium scaffolds was obtained. For the segmentation of the μCT 
      images a convolutional network architecture (U-net) was exploited, demonstrating 
      the huge potential of merging high resolution SR-μCT with deep learning (DL) 
      supported data analysis. In total, 30 scaffolds, made of the rare earth alloy 
      Resoloy®, with different strut designs were implanted into the coronary arteries 
      of 10 domestic pigs for 28 days using drug-coated or uncoated angioplasty 
      balloons for post-dilatation. The degradation morphology was analyzed using 
      scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and SR-μCT. 
      The data from these methods were then related to data from angiography, optical 
      coherence tomography and histology. A thinner strut size (95 vs. 130 μm) and the 
      presence of paclitaxel indicated a slower degradation rate at 28 d in vivo, which 
      positively influences the late lumen loss (0.5 and 0.6 mm vs. 1.0 and 1.1 mm) and 
      recoil values (0 and 1.7% vs. 6.1 and 22%).

LID - 100085
AB  - Pathology residency programs vary greatly across the United States. To the 
      authors' knowledge, little is formally known about the "phenotype" or career 
      pathways of pathology residency program directors (PDs). PDs, former PDs (FPDs), 
      and associate PDs (APDs) were surveyed, aiming to address whether or not dominant 
      phenotypes or pathways to graduate medical education leadership exist. Several 
      trends emerged including: 76% Whites, 70% females, 15% MD/PhDs, and more junior 
      faculty (33% being <5 years in practice, another 24% being in practice <10 years, 
      and 41% assistant professors at time of first PD/APD appointment). Anatomic and 
      clinical pathology-certified individuals represented 79%. Sixty-two percent of 
      respondents were on a nontenure employment track, with only 18% indicating tenure 
      track. For subspecialty focus, cytopathology (25%), transfusion medicine (16%), 
      and hematopathology (14%) represented the most common subspecialties practiced. A 
      majority (65%) had served as a chief resident during residency, and most (61%) of 
      PDs had served as APDs first. Most (60%) had not served as fellowship director. 
      Most (65%) had not participated in any education leadership training, with 27% 
      having participated in certificate programs or other educational professional 
      development. Thematic analysis of perceived key criterion in selection for the 
      role was passion for education, demeanor, emotional intelligence, and willingness 
      to serve the department. This information may influence training or experience 
      pursued by individuals aspiring to pathology graduate medical education 
      leadership, inform chairs on qualities to look for, and supplement future 
      educational sessions of the Association of Pathology Chairs Program Directors 
      Council.

TI  - Automated CT LI-RADS v2018 scoring of liver observations using machine learning: 
      A multivendor, multicentre retrospective study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Assessment of computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance 
      imaging Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018 major features 
      leads to substantial inter-reader variability and potential decrease in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma diagnostic accuracy. We assessed the performance and 
      added-value of a machine learning (ML)-based algorithm in assessing CT LI-RADS 
      major features and categorisation of liver observations compared with qualitative 
      assessment performed by a panel of radiologists. METHODS: High-risk patients as 
      per LI-RADS v2018 with pathologically proven liver lesions who underwent 
      multiphase contrast-enhanced CT at diagnosis between January 2015 and March 2019 
      in seven centres in five countries were retrospectively included and randomly 
      divided into a training set (n = 84 lesions) and a test set (n = 345 lesions). An 
      ML algorithm was trained to classify non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement, 
      washout, and enhancing capsule as present, absent, or of uncertain presence. 
      LI-RADS major features and categories were compared with qualitative assessment 
      of two independent readers. The performance of a sequential use of the ML 
      algorithm and independent readers were also evaluated in a triage and an add-on 
      scenario in LR-3/4 lesions. The combined evaluation of three other senior readers 
      was used as reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 318 patients bearing 429 
      lesions were included. Sensitivity and specificity for LR-5 in the test set were 
      0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.72) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) respectively, with 242 
      (70.1%) lesions accurately categorised. Using the ML algorithm in a triage 
      scenario improved the overall performance for LR-5. (0.86 and 0.93 sensitivity, 
      0.82 and 0.76 specificity, 78% and 82.3% accuracy for the two independent 
      readers). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative assessment of CT LI-RADS v2018 major features 
      is feasible and diagnoses LR-5 observations with high performance especially in 
      combination with the radiologist's visual analysis in patients at high-risk for 
      HCC. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Assessment of CT/MRI LI-RADS v2018 major features 
      leads to substantial inter-reader variability and potential decrease in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma diagnostic accuracy. Rather than replacing radiologists, 
      our results highlight the potential benefit from the radiologist-artificial 
      intelligence interaction in improving focal liver lesions characterisation by 
      using the developed algorithm as a triage tool to the radiologist's visual 
      analysis. Such an AI-enriched diagnostic pathway may help standardise and improve 
      the quality of analysis of liver lesions in patients at high risk for HCC, 
      especially in non-expert centres in liver imaging. It may also impact the 
      clinical decision-making and guide the clinician in identifying the lesions to be 
      biopsied, for instance in patients with multiple liver focal lesions.
