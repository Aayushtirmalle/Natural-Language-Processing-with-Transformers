AB  - The continuous monitoring of vital signs is one of the hottest topics in 
      healthcare. Recent technological advances in sensors, signal processing, and 
      image processing spawned the development of no-contact techniques such as remote 
      photoplethysmography (rPPG). To solve the common problems of rPPG including weak 
      extracted signals, body movements, and generalization with limited data 
      resources, we proposed a dual-path estimation method based on video magnification 
      and deep learning. First, image processes are applied to detect, track, and 
      magnificate facial ROIs automatically. Then, the steady part of the wave of each 
      processed ROI is used for the extraction of features including heart rate, PTT, 
      and features of pulse wave waveform. The blood pressures are estimated from the 
      features via a small CNN. Results comply with the current standard and promise 
      potential clinical applications in the future.

TI  - An intelligent telemonitoring application for coronavirus patients: reCOVeryaID.
PG  - 1205766

LID - 1205766
AB  - The COVID-19 emergency underscored the importance of resolving crucial issues of 
      territorial health monitoring, such as overloaded phone lines, doctors exposed to 
      infection, chronically ill patients unable to access hospitals, etc. In fact, it 
      often happened that people would call doctors/hospitals just out of anxiety, not 
      realizing that they were clogging up communications, thus causing problems for 
      those who needed them most; such people, often elderly, have often felt lonely 
      and abandoned by the health care system because of poor telemedicine. In 
      addition, doctors were unable to follow up on the most serious cases or make sure 
      that others did not worsen. Thus, uring the first pandemic wave we had the idea 
      to design a system that could help people alleviate their fears and be constantly 
      monitored by doctors both in hospitals and at home; consequently, we developed 
      reCOVeryaID, a telemonitoring application for coronavirus patients. It is an 
      autonomous application supported by a knowledge base that can react promptly and 
      inform medical doctors if dangerous trends in the patient's short- and long-term 
      vital signs are detected. In this paper, we also validate the knowledge-base 
      rules in real-world settings by testing them on data from real patients infected 
      with COVID-19.

LID - e44541
AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) models improve and become widely integrated into 
      healthcare systems, healthcare providers must understand the strengths and 
      limitations of AI tools to realize the full spectrum of potential patient-care 
      benefits. However, most providers have a poor understanding of AI, leading to 
      distrust and poor adoption of this emerging technology. To bridge this divide, 
      this editorial presents a novel view of ChatGPT's current capabilities in the 
      medical field of radiation oncology. By replicating the format of the oral 
      qualification exam required for radiation oncology board certification, we 
      demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to analyze a commonly encountered patient case, 
      make diagnostic decisions, and integrate information to generate treatment 
      recommendations. Through this simulation, we highlight ChatGPT's strengths and 
      limitations in replicating human decision-making in clinical radiation oncology, 
      while providing an accessible resource to educate radiation oncologists on the 
      capabilities of AI chatbots.

AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the commonest cancers with high morbidity and 
      mortality in the world. How to realize precise diagnosis and therapy of GC owns 
      great clinical requirement. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has 
      been actively explored to apply to early diagnosis and treatment and prognosis of 
      gastric carcinoma. Herein, we review recent advance of AI in early screening, 
      diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of stomach carcinoma. Especially AI combined 
      with breath screening early GC system improved 97.4 % of early GC diagnosis 
      ratio, AI model on stomach cancer diagnosis system of saliva biomarkers obtained 
      an overall accuracy of 97.18 %, specificity of 97.44 %, and sensitivity of 
      96.88 %. We also discuss concept, issues, approaches and challenges of AI applied 
      in stomach cancer. This review provides a comprehensive view and roadmap for 
      readers working in this field, with the aim of pushing application of AI in 
      theranostics of stomach cancer to increase the early discovery ratio and curative 
      ratio of GC patients.

AB  - The biomedical literature is a vast and invaluable resource for biomedical 
      research. Integrating knowledge from the literature with biomedical data can help 
      biological studies and the clinical decision-making process. Efforts have been 
      made to gather information from the biomedical literature and create biomedical 
      knowledge bases, such as KEGG and Reactome. However, manual curation remains the 
      primary method to retrieve accurate biomedical entities and relationships. Manual 
      curation becomes increasingly challenging and costly as the volume of biomedical 
      publications quickly grows. Fortunately, recent advancements in Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) technologies offer the potential to automate the process of 
      curating, updating, and integrating knowledge from the literature. Herein, we 
      highlight the AI capabilities to aid in mining knowledge and building the 
      knowledge base from the biomedical literature.

TI  - Development and validation of an artificial intelligence assisted prenatal 
      ultrasonography screening system for trainees.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.15167 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal anomaly screening via ultrasonography, which involves capturing 
      and interpreting standard views, is highly challenging for inexperienced 
      operators. We aimed to develop and validate a prenatal-screening artificial 
      intelligence system (PSAIS) for real-time evaluation of the quality of anatomical 
      images, indicating existing and missing structures. METHODS: Still 
      ultrasonographic images obtained from fetuses of 18-32 weeks of gestation between 
      2017 and 2018 were used to develop PSAIS based on YOLOv3 with global (anatomic 
      site) and local (structures) feature extraction that could evaluate the image 
      quality and indicate existing and missing structures in the fetal anatomical 
      images. The performance of the PSAIS in recognizing 19 standard views was 
      evaluated using retrospective real-world fetal scan video validation datasets 
      from four hospitals. We stratified sampled frames (standard, similar-to-standard, 
      and background views at approximately 1:1:1) for experts to blindly verify the 
      results. RESULTS: The PSAIS was trained using 134 696 images and validated using 
      836 videos with 12 697 images. For internal and external validations, the 
      multiclass macro-average areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      were 0.943 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.815-1.000) and 0.958 (0.864-1.000); 
      the micro-average areas were 0.974 (0.970-0.979) and 0.973 (0.965-0.981), 
      respectively. For similar-to-standard views, the PSAIS accurately labeled 90.9% 
      (90.0%-91.4%) with key structures and indicated missing structures. CONCLUSIONS: 
      An artificial intelligence system developed to assist trainees in fetal anomaly 
      screening demonstrated high agreement with experts in standard view 
      identification.

TI  - Prediction of postoperative recurrence of oral cancer by artificial intelligence 
      model: Multilayer perceptron.
PG  - 3053-3066
LID - 10.1002/hed.27533 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative recurrence of oral cancer is an important factor 
      affecting the prognosis of patients. Artificial intelligence is used to establish 
      a machine learning model to predict the risk of postoperative recurrence of oral 
      cancer. METHODS: The information of 387 patients with postoperative oral cancer 
      were collected to establish the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. The 
      comprehensive variable model was compared with the characteristic variable model, 
      and the MLP model was compared with other models to evaluate the sensitivity of 
      different models in the prediction of postoperative recurrence of oral cancer. 
      RESULTS: The overall performance of the MLP model under comprehensive variable 
      input was the best. CONCLUSION: The MLP model has good sensitivity to predict 
      postoperative recurrence of oral cancer, and the predictive model with variable 
      input training is better than that with characteristic variable input.
