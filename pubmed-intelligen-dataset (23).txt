TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Software Prototype to Inform Opioid 
      Pharmacovigilance From Electronic Health Records: Development and Usability 
      Study.
LID - e45000 [pii]
LID - 10.2196/45000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of patient health and treatment information captured in 
      structured and unstructured formats in computerized electronic health record 
      (EHR) repositories could potentially augment the detection of safety signals for 
      drug products regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Natural 
      language processing and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide 
      novel methodologies that could be leveraged to extract clinically useful 
      information from EHR resources. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a novel 
      AI-enabled software prototype to identify adverse drug event (ADE) safety signals 
      from free-text discharge summaries in EHRs to enhance opioid drug safety and 
      research activities at the FDA. METHODS: We developed a prototype for web-based 
      software that leverages keyword and trigger-phrase searching with rule-based 
      algorithms and deep learning to extract candidate ADEs for specific opioid drugs 
      from discharge summaries in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
      (MIMIC III) database. The prototype uses MedSpacy components to identify relevant 
      sections of discharge summaries and a pretrained natural language processing 
      (NLP) model, Spark NLP for Healthcare, for named entity recognition. Fifteen FDA 
      staff members provided feedback on the prototype's features and functionalities. 
      RESULTS: Using the prototype, we were able to identify known, labeled, 
      opioid-related adverse drug reactions from text in EHRs. The AI-enabled model 
      achieved accuracy, recall, precision, and F(1)-scores of 0.66, 0.69, 0.64, and 
      0.67, respectively. FDA participants assessed the prototype as highly desirable 
      in user satisfaction, visualizations, and in the potential to support drug safety 
      signal detection for opioid drugs from EHR data while saving time and manual 
      effort. Actionable design recommendations included (1) enlarging the tabs and 
      visualizations; (2) enabling more flexibility and customizations to fit end 
      users' individual needs; (3) providing additional instructional resources; (4) 
      adding multiple graph export functionality; and (5) adding project summaries. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The novel prototype uses innovative AI-based techniques to automate 
      searching for, extracting, and analyzing clinically useful information captured 
      in unstructured text in EHRs. It increases efficiency in harnessing real-world 
      data for opioid drug safety and increases the usability of the data to support 
      regulatory review while decreasing the manual research burden.

TI  - A chat about bipolar disorder.
LID - 10.1111/bdi.13379 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the capabilities of ChatGPT (Chat 
      Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) in generating informative content related to 
      bipolar disorders. The objectives were to evaluate its ability to provide 
      accurate information on symptoms, classification, causes, and management of 
      bipolar disorder and to explore its creativity in generating topic-related songs. 
      METHODS: ChatGPT3 was used for the study, and a series of clinically relevant 
      questions were asked to test its knowledge and creativity. Questions ranged from 
      common symptom descriptions to more artistic requests for songs related to 
      bipolar disorder. RESULTS: ChatGPT demonstrated the capacity to provide basic and 
      informative material on bipolar disorders, including descriptions of symptoms, 
      classification types, causes, and treatment options. It also showed creativity in 
      generating songs that capture the nuances of bipolar symptoms, both during high 
      and low states. CONCLUSIONS: While ChatGPT3 can offer superficial information on 
      psychiatric topics like bipolar disorder, its inability to provide accurate and 
      up-to-date references limits its utility for creating a comprehensive review 
      article for scientific journals. However, it may be helpful in generating 
      educational material and assisting in component tasks for those with bipolar 
      disorder or other psychiatric conditions. As newer versions of AI models are 
      continually developed, their capabilities in producing more accurate and advanced 
      content will need further evaluation.

      tool after implementation.
LID - 10.1111/1742-6723.14325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually found its way into 
      healthcare, and its future integration into clinical practice is inevitable. In 
      the present study, we evaluate the accuracy of a novel AI algorithm designed to 
      predict admission based on a triage note after clinical implementation. This is 
      the first of such studies to investigate real-time AI performance in the 
      emergency setting. METHODS: The novel AI algorithm that predicts admission using 
      a triage note was translated into clinical practice and integrated within St 
      Vincent's Hospital Melbourne's electronic emergency patient management system. 
      The data were collected from 1 January 2021 to 17 August 2022 to evaluate the 
      diagnostic accuracy of the AI system after implementation. RESULTS: A total of 
      77 125 ED presentations were included. The live AI algorithm has a sensitivity of 
      73.1% (95% confidence interval 72.5-73.8), specificity of 74.3% (73.9-74.7), 
      positive predictive value of 50% (49.6-50.4) and negative predictive value of 
      88.7% (88.5-89) with a total accuracy of 74% (73.7-74.3). The accuracy of the 
      system was at the lowest for admission to psychiatric units (34%) and at the 
      highest for gastroenterology and medical admission (84% and 80%, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: Our study showed the diagnostic evaluation of a real-time AI clinical 
      decision-support tool became less accurate than the original. Although real-time 
      sensitivity and specificity of the AI tool was still acceptable as a 
      decision-support tool in the ED, we propose that continuous training and 
      evaluation of AI-enabled clinical support tools in healthcare are conducted to 
      ensure consistent accuracy and performance to prevent inadvertent consequences.

TI  - Standardized pathology report for HER2 testing in compliance with 2023 ASCO/CAP 
      updates and 2023 ESMO consensus statements on HER2-low breast cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s00428-023-03656-w [doi]
AB  - Since the release of the DESTINY-Breast04 (DB-04) trial findings in June 2022, 
      the field of pathology has seen a renaissance of HER2 as a predictive biomarker 
      in breast cancer. The trial focused on patients with metastatic breast cancer who 
      were classified as "HER2-low," i.e., those with immunohistochemistry (IHC) HER2 
      1 + or 2 + and negative in situ hybridization (ISH) results. The study revealed 
      that treating these patients with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) instead of the 
      oncologist's chosen chemotherapy led to outstanding improvements in survival. 
      This has challenged the existing binary HER2 pathological classification system, 
      which categorized tumors as either positive (overexpression/amplification) or 
      negative, as per the ASCO/CAP 2018 guideline reaffirmed by ASCO/CAP 2023 
      guideline update. Given that DB-04 excluded patients with HER2 IHC score 0 
      status, the results of the ongoing DB-06 trial may shed further light on the 
      potential benefits of T-DXd therapy for these patients. Roughly half of all 
      breast cancers are estimated to belong to the HER2-low category, which does not 
      represent a distinct or specific subtype of cancer. Instead, it encompasses a 
      diverse group of tumors that exhibit clinical, morphological, 
      immunohistochemical, and molecular variations. However, HER2-low offers a 
      distinctive biomarker status that identifies a specific therapeutic regimen 
      (i.e., T-DXd) linked to a favorable prognosis in breast cancer. This unique 
      association emphasizes the importance of accurately identifying these tumors. 
      Differentiating between a HER2 IHC score 0 and score 1 + has not been clinically 
      significant until now. To ensure accurate classification and avoid misdiagnosis, 
      it is necessary to adopt standardized procedures, guidelines, and specialized 
      training for pathologists in interpreting HER2 expression in the lower spectrum. 
      Additionally, the utilization of artificial intelligence holds promise in 
      supporting this endeavor. Here, we address the current state of the art and 
      unresolved issues in assessing HER2-low status, with a particular emphasis on the 
      score 0. We explore the dilemma surrounding the exclusion of HER2-zero patients 
      from potentially beneficial therapy based on traditional HER2 testing. 
      Additionally, we examine the clinical context, considering that DB-04 primarily 
      involved heavily pretreated late-stage metastatic breast cancers. We also delve 
      into emerging evidence suggesting that extrapolating HER2-low status from the 
      original diagnosis may lead to misleading results. Finally, we provide 
      recommendations for conducting high-quality testing and propose a standardized 
      pathology report in compliance with 2023 ASCO/CAP updates and 2023 ESMO consensus 
      statements on HER2-low breast cancer.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of ChatGPT-4 in Responding to Common Questions About 
      Abdominoplasty: An AI-Based Case Study of a Plastic Surgery Consultation.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-023-03660-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      health care, AI chatbots like ChatGPT-4 are being used to deliver health 
      information. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the capability of ChatGPT-4 
      in answering common questions related to abdominoplasty, evaluating its potential 
      as an adjunctive tool in patient education and preoperative consultation. 
      METHODS: A variety of common questions about abdominoplasty were submitted to 
      ChatGPT-4. These questions were sourced from a question list provided by the 
      American Society of Plastic Surgery to ensure their relevance and 
      comprehensiveness. An experienced plastic surgeon meticulously evaluated the 
      responses generated by ChatGPT-4 in terms of informational depth, response 
      articulation, and competency to determine the proficiency of the AI in providing 
      patient-centered information. RESULTS: The study showed that ChatGPT-4 can give 
      clear answers, making it useful for answering common queries. However, it 
      struggled with personalized advice and sometimes provided incorrect or outdated 
      references. Overall, ChatGPT-4 can effectively share abdominoplasty information, 
      which may help patients better understand the procedure. Despite these positive 
      findings, the AI needs more refinement, especially in providing personalized and 
      accurate information, to fully meet patient education needs in plastic surgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although ChatGPT-4 shows promise as a resource for patient 
      education, continuous improvements and rigorous checks are essential for its 
      beneficial integration into healthcare settings. The study emphasizes the need 
      for further research, particularly focused on improving the personalization and 
      accuracy of AI responses. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE V: This journal requires that authors 
      assign a level of evidence to each article. For a full description of these

TI  - IQ changes after pediatric epilepsy surgery: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 177-187
LID - 10.1007/s00415-023-12002-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess the intellectual outcome of 
      children who underwent surgery for epilepsy. METHODS: A systematic review of 
      electronic databases was conducted on December 3, 2021, for PubMed and January 
      11, 2022, for Web of Science. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA 
      guidelines. The included studies reported on intelligence quotient (IQ) or 
      developmental quotient (DQ) before and after epilepsy surgery in children. 
      Studies were included, if the patients had medically intractable epilepsy and if 
      the study reported mainly on curative surgical procedures. We conducted a 
      random-effects meta-analysis to determine the mean change of IQ/DQ. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-seven studies reporting on a total of 2593 patients met the inclusion 
      criteria. The mean age at surgery was 9.2 years (± 3.44; range 
      2.4 months-19.81 years). Thirty-eight studies showed IQ/DQ improvement on a group 
      level, 8 yielded stable IQ/DQ, and 19 showed deterioration. Pooled analysis 
      revealed a significant mean gain in FSIQ of + 2.52 FSIQ points (95% CI 
      1.12-3.91). The pooled mean difference in DQ was + 1.47 (95% CI - 6.5 to 9.5). 
      The pooled mean difference in IQ/DQ was 0.73 (95% CI - 4.8 to 6.2). Mean FSIQ 
      gain was significantly higher in patients who reached seizure freedom 
      (+ 5.58 ± 8.27) than in patients who did not (+ 0.23 ± 5.65). It was also 
      significantly higher in patients who stopped ASM after surgery (+ 6.37 ± 3.80) 
      than in patients who did not (+ 2.01 ± 2.41). Controlled studies showed a better 
      outcome in the surgery group compared to the non-surgery group. There was no 
      correlation between FSIQ change and age at surgery, epilepsy duration to surgery, 
      and preoperative FSIQ. SIGNIFICANCE: The present review indicates that there is a 
      mean gain in FSIQ and DQ in children with medically intractable epilepsy after 
      surgery. The mean gain of 2.52 FSIQ points reflects more likely sustainability of 
      intellectual function rather than improvement after surgery. Seizure-free and 
      ASM-free patients reach higher FSIQ gains. More research is needed to evaluate 
      individual changes after specific surgery types and their effect on long-term 
      follow-up.

TI  - Urologist validation of an artificial intelligence-based tool for automated 
      estimation of penile curvature.
LID - S1477-5131(23)00408-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpurol.2023.09.008 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severity of penile curvature (PC) is commonly used to select the 
      optimal surgical intervention for hypospadias, either alone or in conjunction 
      with other phenotypic characteristics. Despite this, current literature on the 
      accuracy and precision of different PC measurement techniques in hypospadias 
      patients remains limited. PURPOSE: Assess the feasibility and validity of an 
      artificial intelligence (AI)-based model for automatic measurement of PC. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven 3D-printed penile models with variable degrees of 
      ventral PC were used to evaluate and compare interobserver agreement in 
      estimation of penile curvatures using various measurement techniques (including 
      visual inspection, goniometer, manual estimation via a mobile application, and an 
      AI-based angle estimation app. In addition, each participant was required to 
      complete a questionnaire about their background and experience. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-five clinical practitioners participated in the study, including pediatric 
      urologists, pediatric surgeons, and urologists. For each PC assessment method, 
      time required, mean absolute error (MAE), and inter-rater agreement were 
      assessed. For goniometer-based measurement, the lowest MAE achieved was derived 
      from a model featuring 86° PC. When using either UVI (unaid visual inspection), 
      mobile apps, or AI-based measurement, MAE was lowest when assessing a model with 
      88° PC, indicating that high-grade cases can be quantified more reliably. Indeed, 
      MAE was highest when PC angle ranged between 40° and 58° for all the investigated 
      measurement tools. In fact, among these methodologies, AI-based assessment 
      achieved the lowest MAE and highest level of inter-class correlation, with an 
      average measurement time of only 22 s. CONCLUSION: AI-based PC measurement models 
      are more practical and consistent than the alternative curvature assessment tools 
      already available. The AI method described in this study could help surgeons and 
      hypospadiology researchers to measure PC more accurately.
