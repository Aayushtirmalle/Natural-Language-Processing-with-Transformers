AB  - The design of robots that interact autonomously with the environment and exhibit 
      complex behaviours is an open challenge that can benefit from understanding what 
      makes living beings fit to act in the world. Neuromorphic engineering studies 
      neural computational principles to develop technologies that can provide a 
      computing substrate for building compact and low-power processing systems. We 
      discuss why endowing robots with neuromorphic technologies - from perception to 
      motor control - represents a promising approach for the creation of robots which 
      can seamlessly integrate in society. We present initial attempts in this 
      direction, highlight open challenges, and propose actions required to overcome 
      current limitations.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Assisted 
      Biomedical Systems for Intelligent Healthcare.
LID - 10.3390/bios12080562 [doi]
LID - 562
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that 
      develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for 
      performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves 
      various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), 
      conventional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique 
      capabilities and functionalities that can improve the performances of modern 
      medical sciences. Such intelligent systems simplify human intervention in 
      clinical diagnosis, medical imaging, and decision-making ability. In the same 
      era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation 
      bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical devices with a 
      software application for advancing human health. In this review, we discuss the 
      importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care (POC) 
      devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer 
      diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic 
      surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in 
      this article. The position and importance of AI in improving the functionality, 
      detection accuracy, decision-making ability of IoMT devices, and evaluation of 
      associated risks assessment is discussed carefully and critically in this review. 
      This review also encompasses the technological and engineering challenges and 
      prospects for AI-based cloud-integrated personalized IoMT devices for designing 
      efficient POC biomedical systems suitable for next-generation intelligent 
      healthcare.

PG  - 20220736

LID - 20220736
AB  - We develop a conceptual framework for studying collective adaptation in complex 
      socio-cognitive systems, driven by dynamic interactions of social integration 
      strategies, social environments and problem structures. Going beyond searching 
      for 'intelligent' collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines 
      and outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions 
      such as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how 
      they change their strategies and network structures in response to different 
      problems and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal 
      trajectories. We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of 
      optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive 
      outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative 
      and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly 
      changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach 
      the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm denotes billions of physical entities 
      connected to Internet that allow the collecting and sharing of big amounts of 
      data. Everything may become a component of the IoT thanks to advancements in 
      hardware, software, and wireless network availability. Devices get an advanced 
      level of digital intelligence that enables them to transmit real-time data 
      without applying for human support. However, IoT also comes with its own set of 
      unique challenges. Heavy network traffic is generated in the IoT environment for 
      transmitting data. Reducing network traffic by determining the shortest route 
      from the source to the aim decreases overall system response time and energy 
      consumption costs. This translates into the need to define efficient routing 
      algorithms. Many IoT devices are powered by batteries with limited lifetime, so 
      in order to ensure remote, continuous, distributed, and decentralized control and 
      self-organization of these devices, power-aware techniques are highly desirable. 
      Another requirement is to manage huge amounts of dynamically changing data. This 
      paper reviews a set of swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms applied to the main 
      challenges introduced by the IoT. SI algorithms try to determine the best path 
      for insects by modeling the hunting behavior of the agent community. These 
      algorithms are suitable for IoT needs because of their flexibility, resilience, 
      dissemination degree, and extension.

PG  - 335-353
LID - 10.1038/s41380-021-01027-y [doi]
AB  - Individual differences in human intelligence, as assessed using cognitive test 
      scores, have a well-replicated, hierarchical phenotypic covariance structure. 
      They are substantially stable across the life course, and are predictive of 
      educational, social, and health outcomes. From this solid phenotypic foundation 
      and importance for life, comes an interest in the environmental, social, and 
      genetic aetiologies of intelligence, and in the foundations of intelligence 
      differences in brain structure and functioning. Here, we summarise and critique 
      the last 10 years or so of molecular genetic (DNA-based) research on 
      intelligence, including the discovery of genetic loci associated with 
      intelligence, DNA-based heritability, and intelligence's genetic correlations 
      with other traits. We summarise new brain imaging-intelligence findings, 
      including whole-brain associations and grey and white matter associations. We 
      summarise regional brain imaging associations with intelligence and interpret 
      these with respect to theoretical accounts. We address research that combines 
      genetics and brain imaging in studying intelligence differences. There are new, 
      though modest, associations in all these areas, and mechanistic accounts are 
      lacking. We attempt to identify growing points that might contribute toward a 
      more integrated 'systems biology' account of some of the between-individual 
      differences in intelligence.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Technologies in the Microsurgical Operating Room 
      (Review).
PG  - 86-94
LID - 10.17691/stm2023.15.2.08 [doi]
AB  - Surgery performed by a novice neurosurgeon under constant supervision of a senior 
      surgeon with the experience of thousands of operations, able to handle any 
      intraoperative complications and predict them in advance, and never getting 
      tired, is currently an elusive dream, but can become a reality with the 
      development of artificial intelligence methods. This paper has presented a review 
      of the literature on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the 
      microsurgical operating room. Searching for sources was carried out in the PubMed 
      text database of medical and biological publications. The key words used were 
      "surgical procedures", "dexterity", "microsurgery" AND "artificial intelligence" 
      OR "machine learning" OR "neural networks". Articles in English and Russian were 
      considered with no limitation to publication date. The main directions of 
      research on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the microsurgical 
      operating room have been highlighted. Despite the fact that in recent years 
      machine learning has been increasingly introduced into the medical field, a small 
      number of studies related to the problem of interest have been published, and 
      their results have not proved to be of practical use yet. However, the social 
      significance of this direction is an important argument for its development.

LID - 10.3390/s23031466 [doi]
LID - 1466
AB  - Continuous advancements of technologies such as machine-to-machine interactions 
      and big data analysis have led to the internet of things (IoT) making information 
      sharing and smart decision-making possible using everyday devices. On the other 
      hand, swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms seek to establish constructive 
      interaction among agents regardless of their intelligence level. In SI 
      algorithms, multiple individuals run simultaneously and possibly in a cooperative 
      manner to address complex nonlinear problems. In this paper, the application of 
      SI algorithms in IoT is investigated with a special focus on the internet of 
      medical things (IoMT). The role of wearable devices in IoMT is briefly reviewed. 
      Existing works on applications of SI in addressing IoMT problems are discussed. 
      Possible problems include disease prediction, data encryption, missing values 
      prediction, resource allocation, network routing, and hardware failure 
      management. Finally, research perspectives and future trends are outlined.

TI  - Natural Intelligence as the Brain of Intelligent Systems.
LID - 10.3390/s23052859 [doi]
LID - 2859
AB  - This article discusses the concept and applications of cognitive dynamic systems 
      (CDS), which are a type of intelligent system inspired by the brain. There are 
      two branches of CDS, one for linear and Gaussian environments (LGEs), such as 
      cognitive radio and cognitive radar, and another one for non-Gaussian and 
      nonlinear environments (NGNLEs), such as cyber processing in smart systems. Both 
      branches use the same principle, called the perception action cycle (PAC), to 
      make decisions. The focus of this review is on the applications of CDS, including 
      cognitive radios, cognitive radar, cognitive control, cyber security, 
      self-driving cars, and smart grids for LGEs. For NGNLEs, the article reviews the 
      use of CDS in smart e-healthcare applications and software-defined optical 
      communication systems (SDOCS), such as smart fiber optic links. The results of 
      implementing CDS in these systems are very promising, with improved accuracy, 
      performance, and lower computational costs. For example, CDS implementation in 
      cognitive radars achieved a range estimation error that is as good as 0.47 (m) 
      and a velocity estimation error of 3.30 (m/s), outperforming traditional active 
      radars. Similarly, CDS implementation in smart fiber optic links improved the 
      quality factor by 7 dB and the maximum achievable data rate by 43% compared to 
      those of other mitigation techniques.

PG  - 464
LID - 10.1186/s12916-022-02668-8 [doi]
LID - 464
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable psychiatric illness 
      exhibiting substantial correlation with intelligence. METHODS: To investigate the 
      shared genetic signatures between BD and intelligence, we utilized the summary 
      statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to conduct the bivariate 
      causal mixture model (MiXeR) and conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) 
      analyses. Subsequent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping in human 
      brain and enrichment analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Analysis with MiXeR 
      suggested that approximately 10.3K variants could influence intelligence, among 
      which 7.6K variants were correlated with the risk of BD (Dice: 0.80), and 47% of 
      these variants predicted BD risk and intelligence in consistent allelic 
      directions. The conjFDR analysis identified 37 distinct genomic loci that were 
      jointly associated with BD and intelligence with a conjFDR < 0.01, and 16 loci 
      (43%) had the same directions of allelic effects in both phenotypes. Brain eQTL 
      analyses found that genes affected by the "concordant loci" were distinct from 
      those modulated by the "discordant loci". Enrichment analyses suggested that 
      genes related to the "concordant loci" were significantly enriched in 
      pathways/phenotypes related with synapses and sleep quality, whereas genes 
      associated with the "discordant loci" were enriched in pathways related to cell 
      adhesion, calcium ion binding, and abnormal emotional phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      confirmed the polygenic overlap with mixed directions of allelic effects between 
      BD and intelligence and identified multiple genomic loci and risk genes. This 
      study provides hints for the mesoscopic phenotypes of BD and relevant biological 
      mechanisms, promoting the knowledge of the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity 
      of BD. The essential value of leveraging intelligence in BD investigations is 
      also highlighted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest physical activity (PA) enhances 
      intelligence, while sedentary behavior (SB) poses a risk. However, causality 
      remains unclear. METHODS: We extracted genetic instruments from large genome-wide 
      association studies summary data and employed an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) 
      approach within a random-effects model as the primary method of Mendelian 
      randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the overall effect of various physical 
      activity statuses on intelligence. To assess IVW stability and MR sensitivity, we 
      also utilized supplementary methods including weighted median, MR-Egger, and 
      MR-PRESSO. Furthermore, multivariable MR analysis was conducted to examine the 
      independent effects of each physical activity trait on intelligence. RESULTS: The 
      MR primary results indicated that LST was negatively associated with intelligence 
      (β = -0.133, 95%CI: -0.177 to -0.090, p = 1.34×10-9), while SBW (β = 0.261, 95% 
      CI: 0.059 to 0.463, p = 0.011) may have a positive effect on intelligence; 
      however, MVPA and SC did not show significant effects on intelligence. Inverse 
      causality analyses demonstrated intelligence significantly influenced all 
      physical activity states. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights a bidirectional 
      causal relationship between physical activity states and intelligence.
