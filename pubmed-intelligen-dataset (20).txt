TI  - Spatial mapping of human hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution reveals 
      aging-associated topographic remodeling.

AB  - The spatial anatomy of hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) has been extensively 
      studied in mice and other preclinical models, but technical challenges have 
      precluded a commensurate exploration in humans. Institutional pathology archives 
      contain thousands of paraffinized BM core biopsy tissue specimens, providing a 
      rich resource for studying the intact human BM topography in a variety of 
      physiologic states. Thus, we developed an end-to-end pipeline involving 
      multiparameter whole tissue staining, in situ imaging at single-cell resolution, 
      and artificial intelligence-based digital whole slide image analysis and then 
      applied it to a cohort of disease-free samples to survey alterations in the 
      hematopoietic topography associated with aging. Our data indicate heterogeneity 
      in marrow adipose tissue (MAT) content within each age group and an inverse 
      correlation between MAT content and proportions of early myeloid and erythroid 
      precursors, irrespective of age. We identify consistent endosteal and 
      perivascular positioning of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with 
      medullary localization of more differentiated elements and, importantly, uncover 
      new evidence of aging-associated changes in cellular and vascular morphologies, 
      microarchitectural alterations suggestive of foci with increased lymphocytes, and 
      diminution of a potentially active megakaryocytic niche. Overall, our findings 
      suggest that there is topographic remodeling of human hematopoiesis associated 
      with aging. More generally, we demonstrate the potential to deeply unravel the 
      spatial biology of normal and pathologic human BM states using intact archival 
      tissue specimens.

LID - e2300031
AB  - PURPOSE: Development of intelligence systems for bladder lesion detection is cost 
      intensive. An efficient strategy to develop such intelligence solutions is 
      needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used four deep learning models (ConvNeXt, 
      PlexusNet, MobileNet, and SwinTransformer) covering a variety of model complexity 
      and efficacy. We trained these models on a previously published educational 
      cystoscopy atlas (n = 312 images) to estimate the ratio between normal and cancer 
      scores and externally validated on cystoscopy videos from 68 cases, with region 
      of interest (ROI) pathologically confirmed to be benign and cancerous bladder 
      lesions (ie, ROI). The performance measurement included specificity and 
      sensitivity at frame level, frame sequence (block) level, and ROI level for each 
      case. RESULTS: Specificity was comparable between four models at frame (range, 
      30.0%-44.8%) and block levels (56%-67%). Although sensitivity at the frame level 
      (range, 81.4%-88.1%) differed between the models, sensitivity at the block level 
      (100%) and ROI level (100%) was comparable between these models. MobileNet and 
      PlexusNet were computationally more efficient for real-time ROI detection than 
      ConvNeXt and SwinTransformer. CONCLUSION: Educational cystoscopy atlas and 
      efficient models facilitate the development of real-time intelligence system for 
      bladder lesion detection.

TI  - Deep-learning model for prenatal congenital heart disease screening generalizes 
      to community setting and outperforms clinical detection.
PG  - 44-52
LID - 10.1002/uog.27503 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite nearly universal prenatal ultrasound screening programs, 
      congenital heart defects (CHD) are still missed, which may result in severe 
      morbidity or even death. Deep machine learning (DL) can automate image 
      recognition from ultrasound. The main aim of this study was to assess the 
      performance of a previously developed DL model, trained on images from a tertiary 
      center, using fetal ultrasound images obtained during the second-trimester 
      standard anomaly scan in a low-risk population. A secondary aim was to compare 
      initial screening diagnosis, which made use of live imaging at the point-of-care, 
      with diagnosis by clinicians evaluating only stored images. METHODS: All 
      pregnancies with isolated severe CHD in the Northwestern region of The 
      Netherlands between 2015 and 2016 with available stored images were evaluated, as 
      well as a sample of normal fetuses' examinations from the same region and time 
      period. We compared the accuracy of the initial clinical diagnosis (made in real 
      time with access to live imaging) with that of the model (which had only stored 
      imaging available) and with the performance of three blinded human experts who 
      had access only to the stored images (like the model). We analyzed performance 
      according to ultrasound study characteristics, such as duration and quality 
      (scored independently by investigators), number of stored images and availability 
      of screening views. RESULTS: A total of 42 normal fetuses and 66 cases of 
      isolated CHD at birth were analyzed. Of the abnormal cases, 31 were missed and 35 
      were detected at the time of the clinical anatomy scan (sensitivity, 53%). Model 
      sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 78%, respectively. Blinded human experts 
      (nâ=â3) achieved meanâÂ±âSD sensitivity and specificity of 55âÂ±â10% (range, 
      47-67%) and 71âÂ±â13% (range, 57-83%), respectively. There was a statistically 
      significant difference in model correctness according to expert-graded image 
      quality (Pâ=â0.03). The abnormal cases included 19 lesions that the model had not 
      encountered during its training; the model's performance in these cases (16/19 
      correct) was not statistically significantly different from that for previously 
      encountered lesions (Pâ=â0.41). CONCLUSIONS: A previously trained DL algorithm 
      had higher sensitivity than initial clinical assessment in detecting CHD in a 
      cohort in which over 50% of CHD cases were initially missed clinically. Notably, 
      the DL algorithm performed well on community-acquired images in a low-risk 
      population, including lesions to which it had not been exposed previously. 
      Furthermore, when both the model and blinded human experts had access to only 
      stored images and not the full range of images available to a clinician during a 
      live scan, the model outperformed the human experts. Together, these findings 
      support the proposition that use of DL models can improve prenatal detection of 
      CHD. Â© 2023 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.

TI  - Evaluation of Comfort Behavior Levels of Newborn by Artificial Intelligence 
      Techniques.
LID - 10.1097/JPN.0000000000000768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the scales most frequently used in the evaluation of newborn 
      comfort levels is the Neonatal Comfort Behavior Scale (NCBS). It is important 
      therefore that an increased use of the NCBS is encouraged through a more 
      practical method of assessment. OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out for the 
      purpose of designing a means of assessing neonatal comfort levels by employing 
      the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). METHODS: The AI-based study was 
      conducted with 362 newborns under treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit 
      of a hospital. A data collection form, the NCBS, and a camera system were used as 
      data collection tools. The data were analyzed with the SPSS Statistics 21.0 
      program. Descriptive statistics and Cohen Îº test were employed in the analysis. 
      RESULTS: The 2 researchers named in the study first labeled the audiovisual 
      recordings of the 362 newborns in the study. These labeled audiovisual recordings 
      were used in training (80%) as well as testing (20%) the AI model. The AI model 
      displayed a rate of success of 99.82%. CONCLUSION: It was ultimately seen that 
      the AI model that had been developed was a successful tool that could be used to 
      determine the comfort behavior levels of newborns in the neonatal intensive care 
      unit.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss 
      worldwide, with a global prevalence that is predicted to substantially increase. 
      Identifying early biomarkers indicative of progression risk will improve our 
      ability to assess which patients are at greatest risk of progressing from 
      intermediate AMD (iAMD) to vision-threatening late-stage AMD. This is key to 
      ensuring individualized management and timely intervention before substantial 
      structural damage. Some structural biomarkers suggestive of AMD progression risk 
      are well established, such as changes seen on color fundus photography and more 
      recently optical coherence tomography (drusen volume, pigmentary abnormalities). 
      Emerging biomarkers identified through multimodal imaging, including reticular 
      pseudodrusen, hyperreflective foci, and drusen sub-phenotypes, are being 
      intensively explored as risk factors for progression towards late-stage disease. 
      Other structural biomarkers merit further research, such as ellipsoid zone 
      reflectivity and choriocapillaris flow features. The measures of visual function 
      that best detect change in iAMD and correlate with risk of progression remain 
      under intense investigation, with tests such as dark adaptometry and 
      cone-specific contrast tests being explored. Evidence on blood and plasma markers 
      is preliminary, but there are indications that changes in levels of C-reactive 
      protein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be used to stratify patients 
      and predict risk. With further research, some of these biomarkers may be used to 
      monitor progression. Emerging artificial intelligence methods may help evaluate 
      and validate these biomarkers; however, until we have large and well-curated 
      longitudinal data sets, using artificial intelligence effectively to inform 
      clinical trial design and detect outcomes will remain challenging. This is an 
      exciting area of intense research, and further work is needed to establish the 
      most promising biomarkers for disease progression and their use in clinical care 
      and future trials. Ultimately, a multimodal approach may yield the most accurate 
      means of monitoring and predicting future progression towards vision-threatening, 
      late-stage AMD.

OAB - Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is an eye disease that causes vision 
      loss. Worldwide, the number of people with AMD is increasing. It is difficult for 
      doctors to know who, among those with AMD, will get worse and lose some of their 
      sight, and who will not. Researchers are trying to find early signs that predict 
      whether AMD will get worse and ways to track AMD progression over time. These 
      signs are known as âbiomarkers.â They can be structural (seen in the structures 
      inside the eye), functional (a change in how well someone sees), genetic, or 
      proteins found in the blood. Being able to identify people with AMD that are most 
      at risk of losing their vision will help to make sure they get more frequent 
      review so that interventions can be started quickly before vision is lost 
      permanently. Some structural and functional biomarkers are already well known, 
      while others may be useful and are being intensively researched. Changes in the 
      blood markers need much more research to be useful. Researchers are also looking 
      at how to combine data from different biomarkers. This may be a better way to 
      follow worsening of AMD over time compared to using a single biomarker. In the 
      future, we may also be able to use artificial intelligence to help combine all 
      biomarker data. This is an exciting area of research that will be important to 
      help improve the vision outcomes for people with AMD.

TI  - Facial recognition by cloud-based APIs following surgically assisted rapid 
      maxillary expansion.
LID - 10.1007/s00056-023-00494-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate whether the facial soft tissue 
      changes of individuals who had undergone surgically assisted rapid maxillary 
      expansion (SARME) would be detected by three different well-known facial 
      biometric recognition applications. METHODS: To calculate similarity scores, the 
      pre- and postsurgical photographs of 22Â patients who had undergone SARME 
      treatment were examined using three prominent cloud computing-based facial 
      recognition application programming interfaces (APIs): AWS Rekognition (Amazon 
      Web Services, Seattle, WA, USA), Microsoft Azure Cognitive (Microsoft, Redmond, 
      WA, USA), and Face++ (Megvii, Beijing, China). The pre- and post-SARME 
      photographs of the patients (relaxed, smiling, profile, and semiprofile) were 
      used to calculate similarity scores using the APIs. Friedman's two-way analysis 
      of variance and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare the similarity 
      scores obtained from the photographs of the different aspects of the face before 
      and after surgery using the different programs. The relationship between 
      measurements on lateral and posteroanterior cephalograms and the similarity 
      scores was evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: The similarity 
      scores were found to be lower with the Face++ program. When looking at the photo 
      types, it was observed that the similarity scores were higher in the smiling 
      photos. AÂ statistically significant difference in the similarity scores 
      (Pâ¯<â0.05) was found between the relaxed and smiling photographs using the 
      different programs. The correlation between the cephalometric and posteroanterior 
      measurements and the similarity scores was not significant (Pâ¯>â0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: SARME treatment caused aÂ significant change in the similarity scores 
      calculated with the help of three different facial recognition programs. The 
      highest similarity scores were found in the smiling photographs, whereas the 
      lowest scores were found in the profile photographs.

TI  - Use of extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, and deep 
      neural networks to evaluate the activity stage of extraocular muscles in 
      thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-023-06256-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a machine learning model to evaluate the activity stage of 
      extraocular muscles in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). METHODS: This 
      study retrospectively analysed data from patients with TAO who underwent 
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 2015 to 2022. Three 
      independent machine learning models, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), 
      light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and deep neural networks (DNNs), were 
      constructed using common clinical features. The performance of these models was 
      compared using evaluation metrics such as the area under the receiver operating 
      curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The importance of 
      features was explained using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). RESULTS: A 
      total of 2561 eyes of 1479 TAO patients were included in this study. The original 
      dataset was randomly divided into a training set (80%, nâ=â2048) and a test set 
      (20%, nâ=â513). In the performance evaluation of the test set, the LightGBM model 
      had the best diagnostic performance (AUC 0.9260). According to the SHAP results, 
      features such as conjunctival congestion, swollen caruncles, oedema of the upper 
      eyelid, course of TAO, and intraocular pressure had the most significant impact 
      on the LightGBM model. CONCLUSION: This study used contrast-enhanced MRI as an 
      objective evaluation criterion and constructed a LightGBM model based on readily 
      accessible clinical data. The model had good classification performance, making 
      it a promising artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tool to help community 
      hospitals evaluate the inflammatory activity of extraocular muscles in TAO 
      patients in a timely manner.

TI  - A fast and accurate identification model for Rhinolophus bats based on 
      fine-grained information.

AB  - Bats are a crucial component within ecosystems, providing valuable ecosystem 
      services such as pollination and pest control. In practical conservation efforts, 
      the classification and identification of bats are essential in order to develop 
      effective conservation management programs for bats and their habitats. 
      Traditionally, the identification of bats has been a manual and time-consuming 
      process. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the accuracy 
      and speed of identification work of such fine-grained images as bats 
      identification can be greatly improved. Bats identification relies on the fine 
      features of their beaks and faces, so mining the fine-grained information in 
      images is crucial to improve the accuracy of bats identification. This paper 
      presents a deep learning-based model designed for the rapid and precise 
      identification of common horseshoe bats (Chiroptera: Rhinolophidae: Rhinolophus) 
      from Southern China. The model was developed by utilizing a comprehensive dataset 
      of 883 high-resolution images of seven distinct Rhinolophus species which were 
      collected during surveys conducted between 2010 and 2022. An improved 
      EfficientNet model with an attention mechanism module is architected to mine the 
      fine-grained appearance of these Rhinolophus. The performance of the model beat 
      other classical models, including SqueezeNet, AlexNet, VGG16_BN, ShuffleNetV2, 
      GoogleNet, ResNet50 and EfficientNet_B0, according to the predicting precision, 
      recall, accuracy, F1-score. Our model achieved the highest identification 
      accuracy of 94.22% and an F1-score of 0.948 with low computational complexity. 
      Heat maps obtained with Grad-CAM show that our model meets the identification 
      criteria of the morphology of Rhinolophus. Our study highlights the potential of 
      artificial intelligence technology for the identification of small mammals, and 
      facilitating fast species identification in the future.

AB  - Histopathology has remained a cornerstone for biomedical tissue assessment for 
      over a century, with a resource-intensive workflow involving biopsy or excision, 
      gross examination, sampling, tissue processing to snap frozen or formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded blocks, sectioning, staining, optical imaging, and microscopic 
      assessment. Emerging chemical imaging approaches, including stimulated Raman 
      scattering (SRS) microscopy, can directly measure inherent molecular composition 
      in tissue (thereby dispensing with the need for tissue processing, sectioning, 
      and using dyes) and can use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide 
      high-quality images. Here we show the integration of SRS microscopy in a 
      pathology workflow to rapidly record chemical information from minimally 
      processed fresh-frozen prostate tissue. Instead of using thin sections, we record 
      data from intact thick tissues and use optical sectioning to generate images from 
      multiple planes. We use a deep learningâbased processing pipeline to generate 
      virtual hematoxylin and eosin images. Next, we extend the computational method to 
      generate archival-quality images in minutes, which are equivalent to those 
      obtained from hours/days-long formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded processing. We 
      assessed the quality of images from the perspective of enabling pathologists to 
      make decisions, demonstrating that the virtual stained image quality was 
      diagnostically useful and the interpathologist agreement on prostate cancer grade 
      was not impacted. Finally, because this method does not wash away lipids and 
      small molecules, we assessed the utility of lipid chemical composition in 
      determining grade. Together, the combination of chemical imaging and AI provides 
      novel capabilities for rapid assessments in pathology by reducing the complexity 
      and burden of current workflows. SIGNIFICANCE: Archival-quality (formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded), thin-section diagnostic images are obtained from thick-cut, 
      fresh-frozen prostate tissues without dyes or stains to expedite cancer 
      histopathology by combining SRS microscopy and machine learning.

      Natural Selection from Genomic Data.

AB  - Inferences of adaptive events are important for learning about traits, such as 
      human digestion of lactose after infancy and the rapid spread of viral variants. 
      Early efforts toward identifying footprints of natural selection from genomic 
      data involved development of summary statistic and likelihood methods. However, 
      such techniques are grounded in simple patterns or theoretical models that limit 
      the complexity of settings they can explore. Due to the renaissance in artificial 
      intelligence, machine learning methods have taken center stage in recent efforts 
      to detect natural selection, with strategies such as convolutional neural 
      networks applied to images of haplotypes. Yet, limitations of such techniques 
      include estimation of large numbers of model parameters under nonconvex settings 
      and feature identification without regard to location within an image. An 
      alternative approach is to use tensor decomposition to extract features from 
      multidimensional data although preserving the latent structure of the data, and 
      to feed these features to machine learning models. Here, we adopt this framework 
      and present a novel approach termed T-REx, which extracts features from images of 
      haplotypes across sampled individuals using tensor decomposition, and then makes 
      predictions from these features using classical machine learning methods. As a 
      proof of concept, we explore the performance of T-REx on simulated neutral and 
      selective sweep scenarios and find that it has high power and accuracy to 
      discriminate sweeps from neutrality, robustness to common technical hurdles, and 
      easy visualization of feature importance. Therefore, T-REx is a powerful addition 
      to the toolkit for detecting adaptive processes from genomic data.
