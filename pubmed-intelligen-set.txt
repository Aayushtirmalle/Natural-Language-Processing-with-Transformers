AB  - Neuromorphic computing has shown remarkable capabilities in silicon-based 
      artificial intelligence, which can be optimized by using Mott materials for 
      functional synaptic connections. However, the research efforts focus on 
      two-terminal artificial synapses and envisioned the networks controlled by 
      silicon-based circuits, which is difficult to develop and integrate. Here, we 
      propose a dynamic network with laser-controlled conducting filaments based on 
      electric field-induced local insulator-metal transition of vanadium dioxide. 
      Quantum sensing is used to realize conductivity-sensitive imaging of conducting 
      filament. We find that the location of filament formation is manipulated by 
      focused laser, which is applicable to simulate the dynamical synaptic connections 
      between the neurons. The ability to process signals with both long-term and 
      short-term potentiation is further demonstrated with ~60 times on/off ratio while 
      switching the pathways. This study opens the door to the development of dynamic 
      network structures depending on easily controlled conduction pathways, mimicking 
      the biological nervous systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT-4.0 
      in answering the 2022 Brazilian National Examination for Medical Degree 
      Revalidation (Revalida) and as a tool to provide feedback on the quality of the 
      examination. METHODS: A total of two independent physicians entered all 
      examination questions into ChatGPT-4.0. After comparing the outputs with the test 
      solutions, they classified the large language model answers as adequate, 
      inadequate, or indeterminate. In cases of disagreement, they adjudicated and 
      achieved a consensus decision on the ChatGPT accuracy. The performance across 
      medical themes and nullified questions was compared using chi-square statistical 
      analysis. RESULTS: In the Revalida examination, ChatGPT-4.0 answered 71 (87.7%) 
      questions correctly and 10 (12.3%) incorrectly. There was no statistically 
      significant difference in the proportions of correct answers among different 
      medical themes (p=0.4886). The artificial intelligence model had a lower accuracy 
      of 71.4% in nullified questions, with no statistical difference (p=0.241) between 
      non-nullified and nullified groups. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT-4.0 showed satisfactory 
      performance for the 2022 Brazilian National Examination for Medical Degree 
      Revalidation. The large language model exhibited worse performance on subjective 
      questions and public healthcare themes. The results of this study suggested that 
      the overall quality of the Revalida examination questions is satisfactory and 
      corroborates the nullified questions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date no research has examined the potential influence of acute 
      stress symptoms (ASD) on subsequent development of post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) symptoms in stroke survivors. Our objective was to examine whether acute 
      stress symptoms measured 1-2 weeks post-stroke predicted the presence of 
      post-traumatic stress symptoms measured 6-12 weeks later. DESIGN: Prospective 
      within-groups study. METHODS: Fifty four participants who completed a measure of 
      acute stress disorder at 1-2 weeks following stroke (time 1) and 31 of these 
      participants completed a measure of posttraumatic stress disorder 6-12 weeks 
      later (time 2). Participants also completed measures of stroke severity, 
      functional impairment, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, pre-morbid 
      intelligence and pain across both time points. RESULTS: Some 22% met the criteria 
      for ASD at baseline and of those, 62.5% went on to meet the criteria for PTSD at 
      follow-up. Meanwhile two of the seven participants (28.6%) who met the criteria 
      for PTSD at Time 2, did not meet the ASD criteria at Time 1 (so that PTSD 
      developed subsequently). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated 
      that the presence of acute stress symptoms at baseline was predictive of 
      post-traumatic stress symptoms at follow-up (R2 = .26, p < .01). Less severe 
      stroke was correlated with higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 
      Time 2 (rho = .42, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of 
      early assessment and identification of acute stress symptoms in stroke survivors 
      as a risk factor for subsequent PTSD. Both ASD and PTSD were prevalent and the 
      presence of both disorders should be assessed.

AB  - Problems with erroneous forecasts of electricity production from solar farms 
      create serious operational, technological, and financial challenges to both Solar 
      farm owners and electricity companies. Accurate prediction results are necessary 
      for efficient spinning reserve planning as well as regulating inertia and power 
      supply during contingency events. In this work, the impact of several climatic 
      conditions on solar electricity generation in Amherst. Furthermore, three machine 
      learning models using Lasso Regression, ridge Regression, ElasticNet regression, 
      and Support Vector Regression, as well as deep learning models for time series 
      analysis include long short-term memory, bidirectional LSTM, and gated recurrent 
      unit along with their variants for estimating solar energy generation for every 
      five-minute interval on Amherst weather power station. These models were 
      evaluated using mean absolute error root means square error, mean square error, 
      and mean absolute percentage error. It was observed that horizontal solar 
      irradiance and water saturation deficiency had a highly proportional relationship 
      with Solar PV electricity generation. All proposed machine learning models turned 
      out to perform well in predicting electricity generation from the analyzed solar 
      farm. Bi-LSTM has performed the best among all models with 0.0135, 0.0315, 
      0.0012, and 0.1205 values of MAE, RMSE, MSE, and MAPE, respectively. Comparison 
      with the existing methods endorses the use of our proposed RNN variants for 
      higher efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. Multistep-ahead solar energy 
      prediction is also carried out by exploiting hybrids of LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU.

TI  - INNAbstract: An INN-Based Abstraction Method for Large-Scale Neural Network 
      Verification.
LID - 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3316551 [doi]
AB  - Neural networks (NNs) have witnessed widespread deployment across various 
      domains, including some safety-critical applications. In this regard, the demand 
      for verifying means of such artificial intelligence techniques is more and more 
      pressing. Nowadays, the development of evaluation approaches for NNs is a hot 
      topic that is attracting considerable interest, and a number of verification 
      methods have been proposed. Yet, a challenging issue for NN verification is 
      pertaining to the scalability when some NNs of practical interest have to be 
      evaluated. This work aims to present INNAbstract, an abstraction method to reduce 
      the size of NNs, which leads to improving the scalability of NN verification and 
      reachability analysis methods. This is achieved by merging neurons while ensuring 
      that the obtained model (i.e., abstract model) overapproximates the original one. 
      INNAbstract supports networks with numerous activation functions. In addition, we 
      propose a heuristic for nodes' selection to build more precise abstract models, 
      in the sense that the outputs are closer to those of the original network. The 
      experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach compared 
      to the existing relevant abstraction techniques. Furthermore, they demonstrate 
      that INNAbstract can help the existing verification tools to be applied on larger 
      networks while considering various activation functions.

TI  - An Actionable Expert-System Algorithm to Support Nurse-Led Cancer Survivorship 
      Care: Algorithm Development Study.
PG  - e44332
LID - 10.2196/44332 [doi]
LID - e44332
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comprehensive models of survivorship care are necessary to improve 
      access to and coordination of care. New models of care provide the opportunity to 
      address the complexity of physical and psychosocial problems and long-term health 
      needs experienced by patients following cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: This paper 
      presents our expert-informed, rules-based survivorship algorithm to build a 
      nurse-led model of survivorship care to support men living with prostate cancer 
      (PCa). The algorithm is called No Evidence of Disease (Ned) and supports timelier 
      decision-making, enhanced safety, and continuity of care. METHODS: An initial 
      rule set was developed and refined through working groups with clinical experts 
      across Canada (eg, nurse experts, physician experts, and scientists; n=20), and 
      patient partners (n=3). Algorithm priorities were defined through a 
      multidisciplinary consensus meeting with clinical nurse specialists, nurse 
      scientists, nurse practitioners, urologic oncologists, urologists, and radiation 
      oncologists (n=17). The system was refined and validated using the nominal group 
      technique. RESULTS: Four levels of alert classification were established, 
      initiated by responses on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for 
      Clinical Practice survey, and mediated by changes in minimal clinically important 
      different alert thresholds, alert history, and clinical urgency with patient 
      autonomy influencing clinical acuity. Patient autonomy was supported through 
      tailored education as a first line of response, and alert escalation depending on 
      a patient-initiated request for a nurse consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The Ned 
      algorithm is positioned to facilitate PCa nurse-led care models with a high 
      nurse-to-patient ratio. This novel expert-informed PCa survivorship care 
      algorithm contains a defined escalation pathway for clinically urgent symptoms 
      while honoring patient preference. Though further validation is required through 
      a pragmatic trial, we anticipate the Ned algorithm will support timelier 
      decision-making and enhance continuity of care through the automation of more 
      frequent automated checkpoints, while empowering patients to self-manage their 
      symptoms more effectively than standard care. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT

TI  - Prompt Engineering as an Important Emerging Skill for Medical Professionals: 
      Tutorial.
PG  - e50638
LID - 10.2196/50638 [doi]
LID - e50638
AB  - Prompt engineering is a relatively new field of research that refers to the 
      practice of designing, refining, and implementing prompts or instructions that 
      guide the output of large language models (LLMs) to help in various tasks. With 
      the emergence of LLMs, the most popular one being ChatGPT that has attracted the 
      attention of over a 100 million users in only 2 months, artificial intelligence 
      (AI), especially generative AI, has become accessible for the masses. This is an 
      unprecedented paradigm shift not only because of the use of AI becoming more 
      widespread but also due to the possible implications of LLMs in health care. As 
      more patients and medical professionals use AI-based tools, LLMs being the most 
      popular representatives of that group, it seems inevitable to address the 
      challenge to improve this skill. This paper summarizes the current state of 
      research about prompt engineering and, at the same time, aims at providing 
      practical recommendations for the wide range of health care professionals to 
      improve their interactions with LLMs.
