TI  - Comparing transfusion practice at multiple hospitals using electronically 
      collected and analysed data.
PG  - 453-459
LID - 10.1111/tme.13008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparisons of transfusion practice between organisations are 
      time-consuming using manual methods for data collection. We performed a 
      feasibility study to determine whether large-scale transfusion data from three 
      English hospitals could be combined to allow comparisons of transfusion practice. 
      METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and transfusion data from patients discharged 
      between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 were extracted from Patient Administration 
      Systems (PAS), Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), and electronic 
      transfusion systems at three NHS hospitals, which are academic medical centres 
      based in large cities outside London. A centralised database and business 
      intelligence software were used to compare the data. RESULTS: The dataset 
      contained 748 982 episodes of patient care with 91 410 blood components 
      transfused. The study confirms the results of previous studies finding peaks in 
      the ages of transfusion in the 0-4 years age range, in women of childbearing 
      ages, and in males over 60 years. The number of components transfused per 1000 
      bed days was used as a standardised comparator. Red cell utilisation was 42.4, 
      40.4 and 49.5 units/1000 bed days and platelet utilisation 11.69, 7.76, and 
      11.66 units/1000 bed days. 60.5% (6848/11 310) of Group O D negative red cell 
      units were transfused to non-group O D negative recipients. An analysis of 
      component usage highlighted variations in practice, for example platelet usage 
      for cardiac surgery varied from 2.4% to 7.3% across the three hospitals. 
      CONCLUSION: This feasibility study demonstrates that large electronic datasets 
      from hospitals can be combined to identify areas for targeted interventions to 
      improve transfusion practice.

      and composition at continental extents.
PG  - e4175
LID - 10.1002/ecy.4175 [doi]
AB  - Effective solutions to conserve biodiversity require accurate community- and 
      species-level information at relevant, actionable scales and across entire 
      species' distributions. However, data and methodological constraints have limited 
      our ability to provide such information in robust ways. Herein we employ a 
      Deep-Reasoning Network implementation of the Deep Multivariate Probit Model 
      (DMVP-DRNets), an end-to-end deep neural network framework, to exploit large 
      observational and environmental data sets together and estimate landscape-scale 
      species diversity and composition at continental extents. We present results from 
      a novel year-round analysis of North American avifauna using data from over nine 
      million eBird checklists and 72 environmental covariates. We highlight the 
      utility of our information by identifying critical areas of high species 
      diversity for a single group of conservation concern, the North American wood 
      warblers, while capturing spatiotemporal variation in species' environmental 
      associations and interspecific interactions. In so doing, we demonstrate the type 
      of accurate, high-resolution information on biodiversity that deep learning 
      approaches such as DMVP-DRNets can provide and that is needed to inform 
      ecological research and conservation decision-making at multiple scales.

TI  - Evaluation of children's oral diagnosis and treatment using imaging examination 
      using AI based Internet of Things.
LID - 10.3233/THC-230099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) plays an important role 
      in the diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases, its image segmentation method 
      needs to be further improved, and there are still objections about the clinical 
      application effect of general anesthesia (GA) on children's dental fear (CDF). 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the application value of CBCT based on 
      intelligent computer segmentation model in oral diagnosis and treatment of 
      children in the context of biomedical signals, and to analyze the alleviating 
      effect of GA on CDF. METHODS: Based on the regional level set (CV) algorithm, the 
      local binary fitting (LBF) model was introduced to optimize it, and the tooth 
      CBCT image segmentation model CV-LBF was established to compare the segmentation 
      accuracy (SA), maximum symmetric surface distance (MSSD), average symmetric 
      surface distance (ASSD), over segmentation rate (OR), and under segmentation rate 
      (UR) between these model and other algorithms. 82 children with CDF were divided 
      into general anesthesia group (GAG) (n= 38) and controls (n= 44) according to the 
      voluntary principle of their families. Children in GAG were treated with GA and 
      controls with protective fixed intervention. Children's fear survey 
      schedule-dental subscale (CFSS-DS) and Venham scores were counted before 
      intervention in the two groups. CFSS-DS scores were recorded at 2 hours after 
      intervention and after recovery in children in GAG. CFSS-DS and Venham scores 
      were performed in all children 1 week after surgery. RESULTS: The results showed 
      that the S⁢A value of CV-LBF algorithm was higher than that of region growing 
      algorithm (P< 0.05). OR, UR, MSSD, and ASSD values of CV-LBF algorithm were 
      evidently lower than those of other algorithms (P< 0.05). CFSS-DS scores were 
      lower in GAG than in controls 2 hours after intervention and at return visits 
      after 1 week of intervention (P< 0.001), and Venham scores were lower in GAG than 
      in controls after intervention (P< 0.001). After intervention, the proportion of 
      children with Venham grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 was obviously higher in GAG than in 
      controls (P< 0.001), while the proportion of children with Venham grade 4 and 5 
      was clearly higher in controls than in GAG (P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results 
      revealed that the computer intelligent segmentation model CV-LBF has potential 
      application value in CBCT image segmentation of children's teeth, and GA can 
      effectively alleviate anxiety of children with CDF and can be used as biomedical 
      signals.

TI  - Circadian preference and physical and cognitive performance in adolescence: A 
      scoping review.
PG  - 1296-1331

AB  - Adolescence is a crucial period of development which coincides with changes in 
      circadian rhythmicity. This may augment the impact of circadian preference on 
      performance in this group. We aimed to scope the literature available on 
      chronotypes and their effect on physical and mental aspects of performance in 
      adolescents. Studies were identified by systematically searching bibliographical 
      databases and grey literature. The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire was the 
      most frequently reported tool for circadian preference assessment. Academic 
      achievement was the most prevailing outcome, with evidence suggesting that 
      morning type adolescents tend to outperform evening types, yet the results vary 
      depending on multiple factors. Performance in tests of intelligence and executive 
      functions was generally better at optimal times of the day (synchrony effect). 
      Physical performance was examined in 8 studies, with very heterogeneous outcomes. 
      Although the associations between circadian preference and performance in 
      adolescents are evident in some areas, there are many factors that may be 
      involved in the relationship and require further investigation. This review 
      highlights the assessment of physical performance in relation to chronotypes, the 
      multidimensional assessment of circadian preference, and the need for 
      longitudinal studies as priorities for further research.Protocol: OSF

AB  - Background: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance with 
      breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), 
      such as the development of models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, new opportunities are 
      emerging for efficient curation of electronic health records (EHR) into 
      real-world data (RWD) for evidence generation in oncology. Our objective is to 
      describe the research and development of industry methods to promote transparency 
      and explainability. Methods: We applied NLP with ML techniques to train, 
      validate, and test the extraction of information from unstructured documents 
      (e.g., clinician notes, radiology reports, lab reports, etc.) to output a set of 
      structured variables required for RWD analysis. This research used a nationwide 
      electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. Models were selected based on 
      performance. Variables curated with an approach using ML extraction are those 
      where the value is determined solely based on an ML model (i.e. not confirmed by 
      abstraction), which identifies key information from visit notes and documents. 
      These models do not predict future events or infer missing information. Results: 
      We developed an approach using NLP and ML for extraction of clinically meaningful 
      information from unstructured EHR documents and found high performance of output 
      variables compared with variables curated by manually abstracted data. These 
      extraction methods resulted in research-ready variables including initial cancer 
      diagnosis with date, advanced/metastatic diagnosis with date, disease stage, 
      histology, smoking status, surgery status with date, biomarker test results with 
      dates, and oral treatments with dates. Conclusion: NLP and ML enable the 
      extraction of retrospective clinical data in EHR with speed and scalability to 
      help researchers learn from the experience of every person with cancer.

TI  - ChatGPT Assisting Diagnosis of Neuro-ophthalmology Diseases Based on Case 
      Reports.
LID - 2023.09.13.23295508 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.09.13.23295508 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) including 
      ChatGPT to assist in diagnosing neuro-ophthalmic diseases based on case reports. 
      DESIGN: Prospective study. SUBJECTS OR PARTICIPANTS: We selected 22 different 
      case reports of neuro-ophthalmic diseases from a publicly available online 
      database. These cases included a wide range of chronic and acute diseases that 
      are commonly seen by neuro-ophthalmic sub-specialists. METHODS: We inserted the 
      text from each case as a new prompt into both ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 
      and asked for the most probable diagnosis. We then presented the exact 
      information to two neuro-ophthalmologists and recorded their diagnoses followed 
      by comparison to responses from both versions of ChatGPT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Diagnostic accuracy in terms of number of correctly diagnosed cases among 
      diagnoses. RESULTS: ChatGPT v3.5, ChatGPT Plus v4.0, and the two 
      neuro-ophthalmologists were correct in 13 (59%), 18 (82%), 19 (86%), and 19 (86%) 
      out of 22 cases, respectively. The agreement between the various diagnostic 
      sources were as follows: ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0, 13 (59%); ChatGPT 
      v3.5 and the first neuro-ophthalmologist, 12 (55%); ChatGPT v3.5 and the second 
      neuro-ophthalmologist, 12 (55%); ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and the first 
      neuro-ophthalmologist, 17 (77%); ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and the second 
      neuro-ophthalmologist, 16 (73%); and first and second neuro-ophthalmologists 17 
      (17%). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 in 
      diagnosing patients with neuro-ophthalmic diseases was 59% and 82%, respectively. 
      With further development, ChatGPT Plus v4.0 may have potential to be used in 
      clinical care settings to assist clinicians in providing quick, accurate 
      diagnoses of patients in neuro-ophthalmology. The applicability of using LLMs 
      like ChatGPT in clinical settings that lack access to subspeciality trained 
      neuro-ophthalmologists deserves further research.

TI  - Perspectives on artificial intelligence in healthcare from a Patient and Public

AB  - Patients and members of the public are the end users of healthcare, but little is 
      known about their views on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, 
      particularly in the Japanese context. This paper reports on an exploratory 
      two-part workshop conducted with members of a Patient and Public Involvement 
      Panel in Japan, which was designed to identify their expectations and concerns 
      about the use of AI in healthcare broadly. 55 expectations and 52 concerns were 
      elicited from workshop participants, who were then asked to cluster and title 
      these expectations and concerns. Thematic content analysis was used to identify 
      12 major themes from this data. Participants had notable expectations around 
      improved hospital administration, improved quality of care and patient 
      experience, and positive changes in roles and relationships, and reductions in 
      costs and disparities. These were counterbalanced by concerns about problematic 
      changes to healthcare and a potential loss of autonomy, as well as risks around 
      accountability and data management, and the possible emergence of new 
      disparities. The findings reflect participants' expectations for AI as a possible 
      solution for long-standing issues in healthcare, though their overall balanced 
      view of AI mirrors findings reported in other contexts. Thus, this paper offers 
      initial, novel insights into perspectives on AI in healthcare from the Japanese 
      context. Moreover, the findings are used to argue for the importance of involving 
      patient and public stakeholders in deliberation on AI in healthcare.

TI  - Clinical applicability of an artificial intelligence prediction algorithm for 
      early prediction of non-persistent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1168054
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2023.1168054 [doi]
LID - 1168054
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is difficult to document atrial fibrillation (AF) on ECG 
      in patients with non-persistent atrial fibrillation (non-PeAF). There is limited 
      understanding of whether an AI prediction algorithm could predict the occurrence 
      of non-PeAF from the information of normal sinus rhythm (SR) of a 12-lead ECG. 
      This study aimed to derive a precise predictive AI model for screening non-PeAF 
      using SR ECG within 4 weeks. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 
      patients aged 18 to 99 with SR ECG on 12-lead standard ECG (10 seconds) in Ewha 
      Womans University Medical Center for 3 years. Data were preprocessed into three 
      window periods (which are defined with the duration from SR to non-PeAF 
      detection) - 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks from the AF detection prospectively. 
      For experiments, we adopted a Residual Neural Network model based on 1D-CNN 
      proposed in a previous study. We used 7,595 SR ECGs (extracted from 215,875 ECGs) 
      with window periods of 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks for analysis. RESULTS: The 
      prediction algorithm showed an AUC of 0.862 and an F1-score of 0.84 in the 1:4 
      matched group of a 1-week window period. For the 1:4 matched group of a 2-week 
      window period, it showed an AUC of 0.864 and an F1-score of 0.85. Finally, for 
      the 1:4 matched group of a 4-week window period, it showed an AUC of 0.842 and an 
      F1-score of 0.83. CONCLUSION: The AI prediction algorithm showed the possibility 
      of risk stratification for early detection of non-PeAF. Moreover, this study 
      showed that a short window period is also sufficient to detect non-PeAF.

LID - 1217411
AB  - Objective: This study aims to explore the clinical application of an AI-3D 
      reconstruction system in measuring lung volume and analyze its practical value in 
      donor-recipient size matching in lung transplantation. Methods: The study 
      retrospectively collected data from 75 subjects who underwent a plethysmography 
      examination and lung CT at the First Hospital of Jilin University. General data 
      and information related to lung function, and imaging results were collected. The 
      correlation between actual total lung volume (aTLV), predicted total lung volume 
      (pTLV), and artificial intelligence three-dimensional reconstruction CT lung 
      volume (AI-3DCTVol) was analyzed for the overall, male, and female groups. The 
      correlation coefficient and the absolute error percentage with pTLV and 
      AI-3DCTVol were obtained. Results: In the overall, male, and female groups, there 
      were statistical differences (p <0.05) between the pTLV formula and AI-3D 
      reconstruction compared to the plethysmography examination value. The ICC between 
      pTLV and aTLV for all study participants was 0.788 (95% CI: 0.515-0.893), p 
      <0.001. Additionally, the ICC value between AI-3D reconstruction and aTLV was 
      0.792 (95% CI: 0.681-0.866), p <0.001. For male study participants, the ICC 
      between pTLV and aTLV was 0.330 (95% CI: 0.032-0.617), p = 0.006. Similarly, the 
      ICC value between AI-3D reconstruction and aTLV was 0.413 (95% CI: 0.089-0.662), 
      p = 0.007. In the case of female research subjects, the ICC between pTLV and aTLV 
      was 0.279 (95% CI: 0.001-0.523), p = 0.012. Further, the ICC value between AI-3D 
      reconstruction and aTLV was 0.615 (95% CI: 0.561-0.870), p <0.001. Conclusion: 
      The AI-3D reconstruction, as a convenient method, has significant potential for 
      application in lung transplantation.
