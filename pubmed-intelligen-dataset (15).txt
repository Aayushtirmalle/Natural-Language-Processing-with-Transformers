AB  - BACKGROUND: Although systemic postoperative therapy after surgery for colorectal 
      liver metastases is generally recommended, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy 
      has been debated. We used machine learning to develop a decision tree and define 
      which patients may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after hepatectomy for 
      colorectal liver metastases. METHODS: Patients who underwent curative-intent 
      resection for colorectal liver metastases between 2000 and 2020 were identified 
      from an international multi-institutional database. An optimal policy tree 
      analysis was used to determine the optimal assignment of the adjuvant 
      chemotherapy to subgroups of patients for overall survival and recurrence-free 
      survival. RESULTS: Among 1,358 patients who underwent curative-intent resection 
      of colorectal liver metastases, 1,032 (76.0%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
      After a median follow-up of 28.7 months (interquartile range 13.7-52.0), 5-year 
      overall survival was 67.5%, and 3-year recurrence-free survival was 52.6%, 
      respectively. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with better recurrence-free 
      survival (3-year recurrence-free survival: adjuvant chemotherapy, 54.4% vs no 
      adjuvant chemotherapy, 46.8%; P < .001) but no overall survival significant 
      improvement (5-year overall survival: adjuvant chemotherapy, 68.1% vs no adjuvant 
      chemotherapy, 65.7%; P = .15). Patients were randomly allocated into 2 cohorts 
      (training data set, n = 679, testing data set, n = 679). The random forest model 
      demonstrated good performance in predicting counterfactual probabilities of death 
      and recurrence relative to receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. According to the 
      optimal policy tree, patient demographics, secondary tumor characteristics, and 
      primary tumor characteristics defined the subpopulation that would benefit from 
      adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: A novel artificial intelligence methodology 
      based on patient, primary tumor, and treatment characteristics may help 
      clinicians tailor adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations after colorectal liver 
      metastases resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existent methodologies for benchmarking the quality of surgical care 
      are linear and fail to capture the complex interactions of preoperative 
      variables. We sought to leverage novel nonlinear artificial intelligence 
      methodologies to benchmark emergency surgical care. METHODS: Using a nonlinear 
      but interpretable artificial intelligence methodology called optimal 
      classification trees, first, the overall observed mortality rate at the index 
      hospital's emergency surgery population (index cohort) was compared to the 
      risk-adjusted expected mortality rate calculated by the optimal classification 
      trees from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement 
      Program database (benchmark cohort). Second, the artificial intelligence optimal 
      classification trees created different "nodes" of care representing specific 
      patient phenotypes defined by the artificial intelligence optimal classification 
      trees without human interference to optimize prediction. These nodes capture 
      multiple iterative risk-adjusted comparisons, permitting the identification of 
      specific areas of excellence and areas for improvement. RESULTS: The index and 
      benchmark cohorts included 1,600 and 637,086 patients, respectively. The observed 
      and risk-adjusted expected mortality rates of the index cohort calculated by 
      optimal classification trees were similar (8.06% [95% confidence interval: 
      6.8-9.5] vs 7.53%, respectively, P = .42). Two areas of excellence and 4 for 
      improvement were identified. For example, the index cohort had 
      lower-than-expected mortality when patients were older than 75 and in respiratory 
      failure and septic shock preoperatively but higher-than-expected mortality when 
      patients had respiratory failure preoperatively and were thrombocytopenic, with 
      an international normalized ratio ≤1.7. CONCLUSION: We used artificial 
      intelligence methodology to benchmark the quality of emergency surgical care. 
      Such nonlinear and interpretable methods promise a more comprehensive evaluation 
      and a deeper dive into areas of excellence versus suboptimal care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the accuracy with which multiple natural 
      language processing artificial intelligence models could predict discharge and 
      readmissions after general surgery. METHODS: Natural language processing models 
      were derived and validated to predict discharge within the next 48 hours and 7 
      days and readmission within 30 days (based on daily ward round notes and 
      discharge summaries, respectively) for general surgery inpatients at 2 South 
      Australian hospitals. Natural language processing models included logistic 
      regression, artificial neural networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations 
      from Transformers. RESULTS: For discharge prediction analyses, 14,690 admissions 
      were included. For readmission prediction analyses, 12,457 patients were 
      included. For prediction of discharge within 48 hours, derivation and validation 
      data set area under the receiver operator characteristic curves were, 
      respectively: 0.86 and 0.86 for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
      Transformers, 0.82 and 0.81 for logistic regression, and 0.82 and 0.81 for 
      artificial neural networks. For prediction of discharge within 7 days, derivation 
      and validation data set area under the receiver operator characteristic curves 
      were, respectively: 0.82 and 0.81 for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
      Transformers, 0.75 and 0.72 for logistic regression, and 0.68 and 0.67 for 
      artificial neural networks. For readmission prediction within 30 days, derivation 
      and validation data set area under the receiver operator characteristic curves 
      were, respectively: 0.55 and 0.59 for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
      Transformers and 0.77 and 0.62 for logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Modern 
      natural language processing models, particularly Bidirectional Encoder 
      Representations from Transformers, can effectively and accurately identify 
      general surgery patients who will be discharged in the next 48 hours. However, 
      these approaches are less capable of identifying general surgery patients who 
      will be discharged within the next 7 days or who will experience readmission 
      within 30 days of discharge.

AB  - The effector repertoire of a pathogen is dynamically evolving. However, the 
      effector translocation mechanism, partly elucidated recently, may be conserved. 
      By targeting the effector translocation machinery, rather than the individual 
      evolving effector, rational design of durable and broad-spectrum disease 
      resistance can be achieved, facilitated by genome-editing and artificial 
      intelligence-enabling technologies.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning as a subcategory of AI, 
      provides opportunities to accelerate and improve the process of discovering and 
      developing new drugs. The use of AI in drug discovery is still in its early 
      stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way new drugs are 
      discovered and developed. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is likely that 
      AI will play an even greater role in the future of drug discovery. AI is used to 
      identify new drug targets, design new molecules, and predict the efficacy and 
      safety of potential drugs. The inclusion of AI in drug discovery can screen 
      millions of compounds in a matter of hours, identifying potential drug candidates 
      that would have taken years to find using traditional methods. AI is highly 
      utilized in the pharmaceutical industry by optimizing processes, reducing waste, 
      and ensuring quality control. This review covers much-needed topics, including 
      the different types of machine-learning techniques, their applications in drug 
      discovery, and the challenges and limitations of using machine learning in this 
      field. The state-of-the-art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is described, 
      covering applications in structure and ligand-based virtual screening, de novo 
      drug creation, prediction of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, drug 
      repurposing, and related topics. Finally, many obstacles and limits of present 
      approaches are outlined, with an eye on potential future avenues for AI-assisted 
      drug discovery and design.

AB  - There is a great demand for the fabrication of soft electronics using hydrogels 
      due to their biomimetic structures and good flexibility. However, conventional 
      hydrogels have poor mechanical properties, which restricts their applications as 
      stretchable sensors. Herein, a facile one-step strategy is proposed to fabricate 
      tough and conductive hydrogels by making use of the graftability of carboxymethyl 
      chitosan without extra conductive matter and crosslinking agent. The obtained 
      polyacrylamide/carboxymethyl chitosan composite hydrogels possess outstanding 
      transmittance and excellent mechanical performances, with tensile breaking stress 
      of 630 kPa, breaking strain of 4560 %, toughness of 8490 kJ/m(3). These hydrogels 
      have low modulus of 5-20 kPa, fast recoverability after unloading, high 
      conductivity of ∼0.85 S/m without the addition of other conductive substances and 
      good biocompatibility. The ionic conductivity of the gels originates from the 
      counterions of carboxymethyl chitosan, affording the hydrogels as resistive-type 
      sensors. The resultant hydrogel sensors demonstrate a broad strain window 
      (0.12-1500 %), excellent linear response, high sensitivity with the gauge factor 
      reaching 11.72, and great durability, capable of monitoring diverse human 
      motions. This work provides a new strategy to develop stretchable conductive 
      hydrogels with promising applications in the fields of artificial intelligence 
      and flexible electronics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the effect of giving Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI)-based radiographic information versus standard radiographic and 
      clinical information to dental students on their pulp exposure prediction 
      ability. METHODS: 292 preoperative bitewing radiographs from patients previously 
      treated were used. A multi-path neural network was implemented. The first path 
      was a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on ResNet-50 architecture. The 
      second path was a neural network trained on the distance between the pulp and 
      lesion extracted from X-ray segmentations. Both paths merged and were followed by 
      fully connected layers that predicted the probability of pulp exposure. A trial 
      concerning the prediction of pulp exposure based on radiographic input and 
      information on age and pain was conducted, involving 25 dental students. The data 
      displayed was divided into 4 groups (G): G(X-ray), G(X-ray+clinical data), 
      G(X-ray+AI), G(X-ray+clinical data+AI). RESULTS: The results showed that AI 
      surpassed the performance of students in all groups with an F1-score of 0.71 
      (P < 0.001). The students' F1-score in G(X-ray+AI) and G(X-ray+clinical data+AI) 
      with model prediction (0.61 and 0.61 respectively) was slightly higher than the 
      F1-score in G(X-ray) and G(X-ray+clinical data) (0.58 and 0.59 respectively) with 
      a borderline statistical significance of P = 0.054. CONCLUSIONS: Although the AI 
      model had much better performance than all groups, the participants when given AI 
      prediction, benefited only 'slightly'. AI technology seems promising, but more 
      explainable AI predictions along with a 'learning curve' are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Postprandial hyperglycemia drives insulin resistance and inflammation, 
      leading to metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). 
      Prediction of postprandial glycemic responses by digital twin (DT) technology can 
      fashion a personalized nutrition, activity, and sleep to treat type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D) and MAFLD. This study examines the effects of DT-enabled personalized 
      nutrition, activity, and sleep on glycemic status, surrogate markers of MAFLD, 
      and magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) in 
      patients with T2D. METHODS: In an open-label randomized trial (2:1), 319 people 
      with T2D were eligible to intervention (DT) or standard care (SC). DT patients 
      followed personalized meal plans with foods suggested by artificial intelligence 
      with least predicted postprandial glycemic response. The primary end point was to 
      compare change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and medicine reduction between the DT 
      and SC groups. Key secondary end points included remission to compare liver 
      function test scores and visceral adiposity using MRI. RESULTS: HbA1(C) was 
      significantly better for DT than for SC (-2.9 [1.8] vs -0.3 [1.2]; P < .001) at 
      1 year with 72.7% remission of T2D. In patients with abnormal baseline values, 
      significant improvements were seen in DT vs SC patients from baseline to 1 year 
      in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease liver fat score (mean [SD]; -2.5 [2.0] 
      vs -0.1 [1.5]; P < .001) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score 
      (-1.20 [0.9] vs -0.1 [1.0]; P < .001), respectively. Improvements are seen with 
      DT compared with SC in other liver fat, fibrosis score, and %liver fat by 
      MRI-PDFF. CONCLUSION: At 1 year, DT-enabled personalized treatment significantly 
      improved hyperglycemia and surrogate markers of MAFLD and MRI-PDFF.
