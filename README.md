# QA-Robot-Med-INLPT-WS2023
#### QA-Robot-Medical is an innovative Question Answering (QA) system tailored for the medical domain (we focus on Intelligence), developed as part of the INLPT-WS2023 final project. This intelligent robot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide accurate and timely answers to a wide range of medical inquiries (encompassing various medical fields) which are related to Intelligence.


Our main focus for the first timeline is the systematic collection of medical-related articles with a focus on intelligence-related topics. Leveraging PubMed, a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, we conducted a targeted search to curate a dataset relevant to the intersection of intelligence and medical sciences. The search strategy employed specific keywords and criteria to ensure the inclusion of articles addressing the nuanced relationship between intelligence and health. The collected articles span various medical disciplines, encompassing neurology, psychology, and related fields. This dataset forms the foundation for subsequent analyses and investigations into the intricate connections between intelligence and medical phenomena. The timeline of data collection adhered to rigorous standards, emphasizing precision, relevance, and diversity within the gathered articles. As we move forward, this curated dataset will serve as a valuable resource for extracting insights and generating embedded vectors, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between intelligence and medicalÂ sciences.
