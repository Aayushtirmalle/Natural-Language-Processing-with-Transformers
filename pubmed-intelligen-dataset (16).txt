AB  - To optimize in the cognitive and emotional processes that appear in stressful 
      situations in sports contexts is a relevant aspect to achieve a high level of 
      performance. The present study aimed to analyze the relationship between 
      perceived stress, emotional intelligence and negative self-talk in runners. It 
      also aimed to determine whether emotional intelligence factors could play a 
      protective role in this relationship. The sample consisted of 1071 runners from a 
      race held in the Basque Country (Spain). The age of the participants was between 
      18 and 75 years (Mean = 41.59; SD = 9.95; 71.4% men). Participants completed an 
      online survey days after the race. The results showed that perceived stress would 
      be related to greater use of negative self-talk. In addition, evaluation of 
      others' emotions and emotional regulation would also explain the occurrence of 
      negative self-talk. Likewise, the interaction between perceived stress and 
      appraisal of one's own emotions would explain the occurrence of negative 
      self-talk, this relationship being stronger among those with lower scores on 
      appraisal of one's own emotions. Results and practical implications of the 
      findings are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence has real potential for early identification 
      of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. An important challenge is the requirement 
      for large databases properly selected, which are not easily obtained. We used a 
      relatively original strategy: a glaucoma recognition algorithm trained with 
      fundus images from public databases and then tested and retrained with a 
      carefully selected patient database. METHODS: The study's supervised deep 
      learning method was an adapted version of the ResNet-50 architecture previously 
      trained from 10,658 optic head images (glaucomatous or non-glaucomatous) from 
      seven public databases. A total of 1,158 new images labeled by experts from 616 
      patients were added. The images were categorized after clinical examination 
      including visual fields in 304 (26%) control images or those with ocular 
      hypertension and 347 (30%) images with early, 290 (25%) with moderate, and 217 
      (19%) with advanced glaucoma. The initial algorithm was tested using 30% of the 
      selected glaucoma database and then re-trained with 70% of this database and 
      tested again. RESULTS: The results in the initial sample showed an area under the 
      curve (AUC) of 76% for all images, and 66% for early, 82% for moderate, and 84% 
      for advanced glaucoma. After retraining the algorithm, the respective AUC results 
      were 82%, 72%, 89%, and 91%. CONCLUSION: Using combined data from public 
      databases and data selected and labeled by experts facilitated improvement of the 
      system's precision and identified interesting possibilities for obtaining tools 
      for automatic screening of glaucomatous eyes more affordably.

LID - 10.1159/000533901 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The last 40 years have seen a remarkable change in our understanding 
      of reflux disease. SUMMARY: These changes encompass disease definition and 
      impact, pathophysiology, diagnostic testing, regulatory oversight of clinical 
      trials, pharmacotherapy, endoscopic, and surgical treatment. We have also seen a 
      number of promising therapies fail. KEY MESSAGES: The future holds the promise of 
      further advances. Adaptive artificial intelligence will take over diagnostics in 
      manometry and pH impedance testing and patient-driven outcomes may be changed by 
      interactions with artificial intelligence rather than humans. Changes in chip 
      technology will allow higher resolution chips to be carried on smaller devices 
      making extra-esophageal areas where reflux may play a role more accessible to 
      prolonged observation and testing.

AB  - The ability to accurately locate all indicators of disease within medical images 
      is vital for comprehending the effects of the disease, as well as for 
      weakly-supervised segmentation and localization of the diagnostic correlators of 
      disease. Existing methods either use classifiers to make predictions based on 
      class-salient regions or else use adversarial learning based image-to-image 
      translation to capture such disease effects. However, the former does not capture 
      all relevant features for visual attribution (VA) and are prone to data biases; 
      the latter can generate adversarial (misleading) and inefficient solutions when 
      dealing in pixel values. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach 
      Visual Attribution using Adversarial Latent Transformations (VA2LT). Our method 
      uses adversarial learning to generate counterfactual (CF) normal images from 
      abnormal images by finding and modifying discrepancies in the latent space. We 
      use cycle consistency between the query and CF latent representations to guide 
      our training. We evaluate our method on three datasets including a synthetic 
      dataset, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and the BraTS 
      dataset. Our method outperforms baseline and related methods on all datasets.

AB  - Topologically knotted proteins have entangled structural elements within their 
      native structures that cannot be disentangled simply by pulling from the N- and 
      C-termini. Systematic surveys have identified different types of knotted protein 
      structures, constituting as much as 1% of the total entries within the Protein 
      Data Bank. Many knotted proteins rely on their knotted structural elements to 
      carry out evolutionarily conserved biological functions. Being knotted may also 
      provide mechanical stability to withstand unfolding-coupled proteolysis. 
      Reconfiguring a knotted protein topology by circular permutation or cyclization 
      provides insights into the importance of being knotted in the context of folding 
      and functions. With the explosion of predicted protein structures by artificial 
      intelligence, we are now entering a new era of exploring the entangled protein 
      universe.

TI  - Machine learning for modeling N(2)O emissions from wastewater treatment plants: 
      Aligning model performance, complexity, and interpretability.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions may account for up to 80 % of a wastewater 
      treatment plant's (WWTP) total carbon footprint. Given the complexity of the 
      pathways involved, estimating N(2)O emissions through mechanistic models still 
      often fails to precisely depict process dynamics. Alternatively, data-driven 
      methods for predicting N(2)O emissions hold substantial potential. However, so 
      far, a comprehensive approach is still overlooked, impeding the advancement of 
      full-scale application. Therefore, this study develops a comprehensive approach 
      for using machine learning to perform online process modeling of N(2)O emissions. 
      The approach is tested on a long-term N(2)O emission dataset from a full-scale 
      WWTP. Uniquely, the proposed approach emphasizes not just model accuracy, but it 
      also considers model complexity, computational speed, and interpretability, 
      equipping operators with the insights needed for informed corrective actions. 
      Algorithms with varying levels of complexity and interpretability including 
      k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), decision trees, ensemble learning models, and deep 
      neural networks (DNN) were considered. Furthermore, a parametric multivariate 
      outlier removal method was adjusted to account for data statistical 
      distributions, significantly reducing data loss. By employing an effective 
      feature selection methodology, a trade-off between data acquisition, model 
      performance, and complexity was found, reducing the number of features by 40 % 
      and decreasing data collection cost, model complexity and computational burden 
      without significant effect on modeling accuracy. The best performing models are 
      kNN (R(2) = 0.88), AdaBoost (R(2) = 0.94), and DNN (R(2) = 0.90). Feature 
      importance of models was analyzed and compared with process knowledge to test 
      interpretability, guiding N(2)O mitigation decisions.

AB  - Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) developed by the United States Environmental 
      Protection Agency (EPA) has been widely applied throughout the world for analysis 
      associated with stormwater runoff, combined sewers, and other drainage 
      facilities. To appropriately manage the runoff in urban areas, an integrated 
      system including the simulations of sewer flow, street flow, and regional channel 
      flow, called the 1D/1D SWMM model, was advocated to be performed. Nevertheless, 
      the execution efficiency of this integrated system still needs to be promoted to 
      meet the demand for real-time forecasting of urban floods. The objective of this 
      study is to seek an alternative for predicting water levels both in the sewer 
      system and on the streets within an urban district during rainstorms by utilizing 
      a dynamic neuron network model. To strengthen the physical structure of the 
      artificial intelligence (AI) model and simultaneously make up for the lack of 
      measured data, simulation results of the 1D/1D SWMM model are provided as labels 
      for the training of the proposed model. The novelty of this research is to 
      propose a new methodology to effectively train the AI model for predicting the 
      spatial distributions of depths based on the hydrologic conditions, 
      geomorphologic properties, as well as the network relation of the drainage 
      system. A two-stage training procedure is proposed in this study to consider more 
      possible inundation conditions in both sewer and street (open channel) drainage 
      networks. The research findings show that the proposed methodology is capable of 
      reaching satisfactory accuracy and assisting the numerical-based SWMM model for 
      real-time warning of drainage systems in the urban district.

AB  - Precision feeding is a strategy for supplying an amount and composition of feed 
      as close that are as possible to each animal's nutrient requirements, with the 
      aim of reducing feed costs and environmental losses. Usually, the nutrient 
      requirements of gestating sows are provided by a nutrition model that requires 
      input data such as sow and herd characteristics, but also an estimation of future 
      farrowing performances. New sensors and automatons, such as automatic feeders and 
      drinkers, have been developed on pig farms over the last decade, and have 
      produced large amounts of data. This study evaluated machine-learning methods for 
      predicting the daily nutrient requirements of gestating sows, based only on 
      sensor data, according to various configurations of digital farms. The data of 73 
      gestating sows was recorded using sensors such as electronic feeders and drinker 
      stations, connected weight scales, accelerometers, and cameras. Nine 
      machine-learning algorithms were trained on various dataset scenarios according 
      to different digital farm configurations (one or two sensors), to predict the 
      daily metabolizable energy and standardized ileal digestible lysine requirements 
      for each sow. The prediction results were compared to those predicted by the 
      InraPorc model, a mechanistic model for the precision feeding of gestating sows. 
      The scenario predictions were also evaluated with or without the housing 
      conditions and sow characteristics at artificial insemination usually integrated 
      into the InraPorc model. Adding housing and sow characteristics to sensor data 
      improved the mean average percentage error by 5.58% for lysine and by 2.22% for 
      energy. The higher correlation coefficient values for lysine (0.99) and for 
      energy (0.95) were obtained for scenarios involving an automatic feeder system 
      (daily duration and number of visits with or without consumption) only. The 
      scenarios including an automatic feeder combined with another sensor gave good 
      performance results. For the scenarios using sow and housing characteristics and 
      automatic feeder only, the root mean square error was lower with gradient tree 
      boosting (0.91 MJ/d for energy and 0.08 g/d for lysine) compared with those 
      obtained using linear regression (2.75 MJ/d and 1.07 g/d). The results of this 
      study show that the daily nutrient requirements of gestating sows can be 
      predicted accurately using data provided by sensors and machine-learning methods. 
      It paves the way for simpler solutions for precision feeding.

OAB - New technologies, such as sensors and automatons, are being developed in 
      agriculture to reduce workload or help farmers make management decisions. The 
      most common approach to the analysis of the huge amount of data generated by 
      these technologies is to use machine-learning algorithms, to detect health or 
      welfare problems for example. The hypothesis was that these automatically 
      collected data and algorithms could also serve to predict the nutrient 
      requirements of gestating sows, usually calculated based on complex models that 
      require a lot of on-farm input data. The predictions of 22 scenarios were 
      compared based on different combinations of sensor data, with the prediction of a 
      nutritional model for gestating sows. The results of nine algorithms applied to 
      the different scenarios were also compared. The results suggested that feeder 
      data, alone or in combination with another sensor, predicted nutrient 
      requirements with high accuracy. Data from other sensors combined with additional 
      information about the sow (i.e., age and body weight) also led to high prediction 
      accuracy. The difference between the algorithms evaluated was relatively 
      significant, but all showed acceptable prediction results, especially non-linear 
      algorithms. In conclusion, this work demonstrated the possibility of accurately 
      predicting daily nutrient requirements for each sow using sensor data and 
      machine-learning algorithms.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many 
      aspects of scholarly publishing. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors might use 
      AI in a variety of ways, and those uses might augment their existing work or 
      might instead be intended to replace it. We are editors of bioethics and 
      humanities journals who have been contemplating the implications of this ongoing 
      transformation. We believe that generative AI may pose a threat to the goals that 
      animate our work but could also be valuable for achieving those goals. In the 
      interests of fostering a wider conversation about how generative AI may be used, 
      we have developed a preliminary set of recommendations for its use in scholarly 
      publishing. We hope that the recommendations and rationales set out here will 
      help the scholarly community navigate toward a deeper understanding of the 
      strengths, limits, and challenges of AI for responsible scholarly work.
