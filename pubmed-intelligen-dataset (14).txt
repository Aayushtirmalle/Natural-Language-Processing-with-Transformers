TI  - Cognitive Profile in Autism and ADHD: A Meta-Analysis of Performance on the 
      WAIS-IV and WISC-V.
LID - acad073 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acad073 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has suggested that neurodevelopmental conditions may 
      be associated with distinctive cognitive profiles on the Wechsler intelligence 
      tests (of which the most recent editions are the WAIS-IV and WISC-V). However, 
      the extent to which a cognitive profile can be reliably identified for 
      individuals meeting criteria for autism or ADHD remains unclear. The present 
      review investigated this issue. METHOD: A search was conducted in PsycInfo, 
      Embase, and Medline in October 2022 for papers reporting the performance of 
      children or adults diagnosed with autism or ADHD on the WAIS-IV or the WISC-V. 
      Test scores were aggregated using meta-analysis. RESULTS: Scores were analyzed 
      from over 1,800 neurodivergent people reported across 18 data sources. Autistic 
      children and adults performed in the typical range for verbal and nonverbal 
      reasoning, but scored ~1 SD below the mean for processing speed and had slightly 
      reduced scores on working memory. This provides evidence for a "spiky" cognitive 
      profile in autism. Performance of children and adults with ADHD was mostly at 
      age-expected levels, with slightly reduced scores for working memory. CONCLUSION: 
      Although the pattern of performance on the Wechsler tests is not sufficiently 
      sensitive or specific to use for diagnostic purposes, autism appears to be 
      associated with a cognitive profile of relative strengths in verbal and nonverbal 
      reasoning and a weakness in processing speed. Attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder appears less associated with a particular cognitive profile. Autistic 
      individuals may especially benefit from a cognitive assessment to identify and 
      support with their strengths and difficulties.

TI  - Enhancing clinical reasoning with Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer: a 
      practical guide.
LID - 10.1515/dx-2023-0116 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate effective methodologies for utilizing 
      the generative artificial intelligence (AI) system, namely the Chat Generative 
      Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), in improving clinical reasoning abilities 
      among clinicians. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive exploration of the 
      capabilities of ChatGPT, emphasizing two main areas: (1) efficient utilization of 
      ChatGPT, with a focus on application and language selection, input methodology, 
      and output verification; and (2) specific strategies to bolster clinical 
      reasoning using ChatGPT, including self-learning via simulated clinical case 
      creation and engagement with published case reports. RESULTS: Effective AI-based 
      clinical reasoning development requires a clear delineation of both system roles 
      and user needs. All outputs from the system necessitate rigorous verification 
      against credible medical resources. When used in self-learning scenarios, 
      capabilities of ChatGPT in clinical case creation notably enhanced disease 
      comprehension. CONCLUSIONS: The efficient use of generative AIs, as exemplified 
      by ChatGPT, can impressively enhance clinical reasoning among medical 
      professionals. Adopting these cutting-edge tools promises a bright future for 
      continuous advancements in clinicians' diagnostic skills, heralding a 
      transformative era in digital healthcare.

TI  - MMiKG: a knowledge graph-based platform for path mining of microbiota-mental 
      diseases interactions.
LID - bbad340 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbad340 [doi]
AB  - The microbiota-gut-brain axis denotes a two-way system of interactions between 
      the gut and the brain, comprising three key components: (1) gut microbiota, (2) 
      intermediates and (3) mental ailments. These constituents communicate with one 
      another to induce changes in the host's mood, cognition and demeanor. Knowledge 
      concerning the regulation of the host central nervous system by gut microbiota is 
      fragmented and mostly confined to disorganized or semi-structured unrestricted 
      texts. Such a format hinders the exploration and comprehension of unknown 
      territories or the further advancement of artificial intelligence systems. Hence, 
      we collated crucial information by scrutinizing an extensive body of literature, 
      amalgamated the extant knowledge of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and depicted it 
      in the form of a knowledge graph named MMiKG, which can be visualized on the 
      GraphXR platform and the Neo4j database, correspondingly. By merging various 
      associated resources and deducing prospective connections between gut microbiota 
      and the central nervous system through MMiKG, users can acquire a more 
      comprehensive perception of the pathogenesis of mental disorders and generate 
      novel insights for advancing therapeutic measures. As a free and open-source 
      platform, MMiKG can be accessed at http://yangbiolab.cn:8501/ with no login 
      requirement.

TI  - Human Gait Activity Recognition Using Multimodal Sensors.
PG  - 2350058
LID - 10.1142/S0129065723500582 [doi]
AB  - Human activity recognition is an application of machine learning with the aim of 
      identifying activities from the gathered activity raw data acquired by different 
      sensors. In medicine, human gait is commonly analyzed by doctors to detect 
      abnormalities and determine possible treatments for the patient. Monitoring the 
      patient's activity is paramount in evaluating the treatment's evolution. This 
      type of classification is still not enough precise, which may lead to unfavorable 
      reactions and responses. A novel methodology that reduces the complexity of 
      extracting features from multimodal sensors is proposed to improve human activity 
      classification based on accelerometer data. A sliding window technique is used to 
      demarcate the first dominant spectral amplitude, decreasing dimensionality and 
      improving feature extraction. In this work, we compared several state-of-art 
      machine learning classifiers evaluated on the HuGaDB dataset and validated on our 
      dataset. Several configurations to reduce features and training time were 
      analyzed using multimodal sensors: all-axis spectrum, single-axis spectrum, and 
      sensor reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne diseases exert a huge impact on both animal and human 
      populations, posing substantial health risks. The behavioural and fitness traits 
      of mosquitoes, such as locomotion and fecundity, are crucial factors that 
      influence the spread of diseases. In existing egg-counting tools, each image 
      requires separate processing with adjustments to various parameters such as 
      intensity threshold and egg area size. Furthermore, accuracy decreases 
      significantly when dealing with clustered or overlapping eggs. To overcome these 
      issues, we have developed EggCountAI, a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural 
      Network (RCNN)-based free automatic egg-counting tool for Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes. METHODS: The study design involves developing EggCountAI for counting 
      mosquito eggs and comparing its performance with two commonly employed 
      tools-ICount and MECVision-using 10 microscopic and 10 macroscopic images of eggs 
      laid by females on a paper strip. The results were validated through manual egg 
      counting on the strips using ImageJ software. Two different models were trained 
      on macroscopic and microscopic images to enhance egg detection accuracy, 
      achieving mean average precision, mean average recall, and F1-scores of 0.92, 
      0.90, and 0.91 for the microscopic model, and 0.91, 0.90, and 0.90 for the 
      macroscopic model, respectively. EggCountAI automatically counts eggs in a folder 
      containing egg strip images, offering adaptable filtration for handling 
      impurities of varying sizes. RESULTS: The results obtained from EggCountAI 
      highlight its remarkable performance, achieving overall accuracy of 98.88% for 
      micro images and 96.06% for macro images. EggCountAI significantly outperformed 
      ICount and MECVision, with ICount achieving 81.71% accuracy for micro images and 
      82.22% for macro images, while MECVision achieved 68.01% accuracy for micro 
      images and 51.71% for macro images. EggCountAI also excelled in other statistical 
      parameters, with mean absolute error of 1.90 eggs for micro, 74.30 eggs for 
      macro, and a strong correlation and R-squared value (0.99) for both micro and 
      macro. The superior performance of EggCountAI was most evident when handling 
      overlapping or clustered eggs. CONCLUSION: Accurate detection and counting of 
      mosquito eggs enables the identification of preferred egg-laying sites and 
      facilitates optimal placement of oviposition traps, enhancing targeted vector 
      control efforts and disease transmission prevention. In future research, the tool 
      holds the potential to extend its application to monitor mosquito feeding 
      preferences.

AB  - The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) has been a subject of 
      performance study for artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, their 
      performance on questions involving USMLE soft skills remains unexplored. This 
      study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT and GPT-4 on USMLE questions involving 
      communication skills, ethics, empathy, and professionalism. We used 80 
      USMLE-style questions involving soft skills, taken from the USMLE website and the 
      AMBOSS question bank. A follow-up query was used to assess the models' 
      consistency. The performance of the AI models was compared to that of previous 
      AMBOSS users. GPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT, correctly answering 90% compared to 
      ChatGPT's 62.5%. GPT-4 showed more confidence, not revising any responses, while 
      ChatGPT modified its original answers 82.5% of the time. The performance of GPT-4 
      was higher than that of AMBOSS's past users. Both AI models, notably GPT-4, 
      showed capacity for empathy, indicating AI's potential to meet the complex 
      interpersonal, ethical, and professional demands intrinsic to the practice of 
      medicine.

AB  - In 2006, Japan's pharmaceutical science education was revised to a 6-year 
      enrollment course, placing greater emphasis on cultivating practical clinical 
      ability. Quality Assurance (QA) measures have been implemented including offering 
      education based on a model core curriculum and third-party assessments. In August 
      2021, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) 
      launched an investigative commission to review the above. For QA, the commission 
      summarized a comprehensive report in August 2022 for items including: modality of 
      selecting entrants; revising enrollment limits; securing education management; 
      information disclosure; corresponding to pharmaceutical education assessments. 
      For revising the model core curriculum, the commission is reviewing 
      correspondence to: demographic changes due to decreasing birthrates, an ageing 
      population, changes in the structure of diseases; rising and emerging infectious 
      diseases; utilizing Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI). As Japan's ageing 
      population is forecast to peak in 2040s, pharmacists must be fostered to provide 
      safe and quality medicine towards a drastically changing future. Medical care is 
      provided through the collaboration of various professions. In such changing 
      demographics, team medicine is crucial to provide quality medical care. Moreover, 
      towards all medical professions sharing the same vision, revisions to the model 
      core curricula for medical and dental education are also being reviewed. The 
      commission is now reviewing detailed curricula to foster pharmacists with 
      competencies to: comprehensively assess patients and ordinary citizens; utilize 
      information science and technology; professionalism. Towards securing quality 
      pharmaceutical education, pharmaceutical departments at universities must also 
      organize and implement an educational curriculum based on the Model Core 
      Curriculum for Pharmaceutical Education. This paper will introduce the 
      investigative commission's review.
