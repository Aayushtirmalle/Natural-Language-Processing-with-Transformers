TI  - Promoting Equity In Clinical Decision Making: Dismantling Race-Based Medicine.

AB  - As the use of artificial intelligence has spread rapidly throughout the US health 
      care system, concerns have been raised about racial and ethnic biases built into 
      the algorithms that often guide clinical decision making. Race-based medicine, 
      which relies on algorithms that use race as a proxy for biological differences, 
      has led to treatment patterns that are inappropriate, unjust, and harmful to 
      minoritized racial and ethnic groups. These patterns have contributed to 
      persistent disparities in health and health care. To reduce these disparities, we 
      recommend a race-aware approach to clinical decision support that considers 
      social and environmental factors such as structural racism and social 
      determinants of health. Recent policy changes in medical specialty societies and 
      innovations in algorithm development represent progress on the path to 
      dismantling race-based medicine. Success will require continued commitment and 
      sustained efforts among stakeholders in the health care, research, and technology 
      sectors. Increasing the diversity of clinical trial populations, broadening the 
      focus of precision medicine, improving education about the complex factors 
      shaping health outcomes, and developing new guidelines and policies to enable 
      culturally responsive care are important next steps.

AB  - One of the most troubling trends in criminal investigations is the growing use of 
      "black box" technology, in which law enforcement rely on artificial intelligence 
      (AI) models or algorithms that are either too complex for people to understand or 
      they simply conceal how it functions. In criminal cases, black box systems have 
      proliferated in forensic areas such as DNA mixture interpretation, facial 
      recognition, and recidivism risk assessments. The champions and critics of AI 
      argue, mistakenly, that we face a catch 22: While black box AI is not 
      understandable by people, they assume that it produces more accurate forensic 
      evidence. In this Article, we question this assertion, which has so powerfully 
      affected judges, policymakers, and academics. We describe a mature body of 
      computer science research showing how "glass box" AI-designed to be 
      interpretable-can be more accurate than black box alternatives. Indeed, black box 
      AI performs predictably worse in settings like the criminal system. Debunking the 
      black box performance myth has implications for forensic evidence, constitutional 
      criminal procedure rights, and legislative policy. Absent some compelling-or even 
      credible-government interest in keeping AI as a black box, and given the 
      constitutional rights and public safety interests at stake, we argue that a 
      substantial burden rests on the government to justify black box AI in criminal 
      cases. We conclude by calling for judicial rulings and legislation to safeguard a 
      right to interpretable forensic AI.

TI  - High-Efficiency Electromagnetic Interference Shielding from Highly Aligned MXene 
      Porous Composites via Controlled Directional Freezing.
PG  - 47566-47576
LID - 10.1021/acsami.3c10599 [doi]
AB  - Lightweight porous composite materials (PCMs) with outstanding electromagnetic 
      interference (EMI) shielding performances are ideal for aerospace, artificial 
      intelligence, military, and other fields. Herein, a three-dimensional 
      Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene/sodium alginate (SA)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (MSC) PCMs was 
      prepared by a controlled directional freezing process. This method constructs a 
      directionally ordered porous structure, which can make the incident 
      electromagnetic waves reflect and scattered several times in the PCMs. The 
      introduction of CNTs into the MSC PCMs can form three-dimensional conductive 
      networks with MXene, thus improving the conductivity and further improving the 
      electromagnetic shielding performance. Furthermore, the SA with abundant hydrogen 
      bonding can strengthen the interlayer interaction between MXene and CNTs. 
      Profiting from the controlled directional freezing and highly aligned porous 
      structure, the MSC PCMs with 75 wt % CNTs exhibit ultrahigh conductivity of 1630 
      S m(-1), an ultrahigh EMI shielding effectiveness of 48.0 dB in X-band for 
      electromagnetic waves incident perpendicular to the hole growth direction, and 
      compressive strength of 72.3 kPa. The as-prepared MSC PCMs show excellent EMI 
      shielding and mechanical properties and have significant applications in the 
      preparation of an entirely novel type of EMI shielding materials with an 
      absorption-based mechanism.

LID - e0285137
AB  - Image dehazing models are critical in improving the recognition and 
      classification capabilities of image-related artificial intelligence systems. 
      However, existing methods often ignore the limitations of receptive field size 
      during feature extraction and the loss of important information during network 
      sampling, resulting in incomplete or structurally flawed dehazing outcomes. To 
      address these challenges, we propose a multi-level perception fusion dehazing 
      network (MPFDN) that effectively integrates feature information across different 
      scales, expands the perceptual field of the network, and fully extracts the 
      spatial background information of the image. Moreover, we employ an error 
      feedback mechanism and a feature compensator to address the loss of features 
      during the image dehazing process. Finally, we subtract the original hazy image 
      from the generated residual image to obtain a high-quality dehazed image. Based 
      on extensive experimentation, our proposed method has demonstrated outstanding 
      performance not only on synthesizing dehazing datasets, but also on 
      non-homogeneous haze datasets.

TI  - XA4C: eXplainable representation learning via Autoencoders revealing Critical 
      genes.
PG  - e1011476
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011476 [doi]
LID - e1011476
AB  - Machine Learning models have been frequently used in transcriptome analyses. 
      Particularly, Representation Learning (RL), e.g., autoencoders, are effective in 
      learning critical representations in noisy data. However, learned 
      representations, e.g., the "latent variables" in an autoencoder, are difficult to 
      interpret, not to mention prioritizing essential genes for functional follow-up. 
      In contrast, in traditional analyses, one may identify important genes such as 
      Differentially Expressed (DiffEx), Differentially Co-Expressed (DiffCoEx), and 
      Hub genes. Intuitively, the complex gene-gene interactions may be beyond the 
      capture of marginal effects (DiffEx) or correlations (DiffCoEx and Hub), 
      indicating the need of powerful RL models. However, the lack of interpretability 
      and individual target genes is an obstacle for RL's broad use in practice. To 
      facilitate interpretable analysis and gene-identification using RL, we propose 
      "Critical genes", defined as genes that contribute highly to learned 
      representations (e.g., latent variables in an autoencoder). As a 
      proof-of-concept, supported by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we 
      implemented eXplainable Autoencoder for Critical genes (XA4C) that quantifies 
      each gene's contribution to latent variables, based on which Critical genes are 
      prioritized. Applying XA4C to gene expression data in six cancers showed that 
      Critical genes capture essential pathways underlying cancers. Remarkably, 
      Critical genes has little overlap with Hub or DiffEx genes, however, has a higher 
      enrichment in a comprehensive disease gene database (DisGeNET) and a 
      cancer-specific database (COSMIC), evidencing its potential to disclose massive 
      unknown biology. As an example, we discovered five Critical genes sitting in the 
      center of Lysine degradation (hsa00310) pathway, displaying distinct interaction 
      patterns in tumor and normal tissues. In conclusion, XA4C facilitates explainable 
      analysis using RL and Critical genes discovered by explainable RL empowers the 
      study of complex interactions.

TI  - Implementing Smartphone-Based Telemedicine for Cervical Cancer Screening in 
      Uganda: Qualitative Study of Stakeholders' Perceptions.
PG  - e45132
LID - 10.2196/45132 [doi]
LID - e45132
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Uganda, cervical cancer (CaCx) is the commonest cancer, accounting 
      for 35.7% of all cancer cases in women. The rates of human papillomavirus 
      vaccination and CaCx screening remain low. Digital health tools and interventions 
      have the potential to improve different aspects of CaCx screening and control in 
      Uganda. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe stakeholders' perceptions of the 
      telemedicine system we developed to improve CaCx screening in Uganda. METHODS: We 
      developed and implemented a smartphone-based telemedicine system for capturing 
      and sharing cervical images and other clinical data, as well as an artificial 
      intelligence model for automatic analysis of images. We conducted focus group 
      discussions with health workers at the screening clinics (n=27) and women 
      undergoing screening (n=15) to explore their perceptions of the system. The focus 
      group discussions were supplemented with field observations and an evaluation 
      survey of the health workers on system usability and the overall project. 
      RESULTS: In general, both patients and health workers had positive opinions about 
      the system. Highlighted benefits included better cervical visualization, the 
      ability to obtain a second opinion, improved communication between nurses and 
      patients (to explain screening findings), improved clinical data management, 
      performance monitoring and feedback, and modernization of screening service. 
      However, there were also some negative perceptions. For example, some health 
      workers felt the system is time-consuming, especially when it had just been 
      introduced, while some patients were apprehensive about cervical image capture 
      and sharing. Finally, commonplace challenges in digital health (eg, lack of 
      interoperability and problems with sustainability) and challenges in cancer 
      screening in general (eg, arduous referrals, inadequate monitoring and quality 
      control) also resurfaced. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility 
      and value of digital health tools in CaCx screening in Uganda, particularly with 
      regard to improving patient experience and the quality of screening services. It 
      also provides examples of potential limitations that must be addressed for

TI  - Accuracy and Reliability of Chatbot Responses to Physician Questions.
PG  - e2336483
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.36483 [doi]
LID - e2336483
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Natural language processing tools, such as ChatGPT (generative 
      pretrained transformer, hereafter referred to as chatbot), have the potential to 
      radically enhance the accessibility of medical information for health 
      professionals and patients. Assessing the safety and efficacy of these tools in 
      answering physician-generated questions is critical to determining their 
      suitability in clinical settings, facilitating complex decision-making, and 
      optimizing health care efficiency. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy and 
      comprehensiveness of chatbot-generated responses to physician-developed medical 
      queries, highlighting the reliability and limitations of artificial 
      intelligence-generated medical information. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Thirty-three physicians across 17 specialties generated 284 medical questions 
      that they subjectively classified as easy, medium, or hard with either binary 
      (yes or no) or descriptive answers. The physicians then graded the 
      chatbot-generated answers to these questions for accuracy (6-point Likert scale 
      with 1 being completely incorrect and 6 being completely correct) and 
      completeness (3-point Likert scale, with 1 being incomplete and 3 being complete 
      plus additional context). Scores were summarized with descriptive statistics and 
      compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. The study 
      (including data analysis) was conducted from January to May 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Accuracy, completeness, and consistency over time and between 2 
      different versions (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) of chatbot-generated medical responses. 
      RESULTS: Across all questions (n = 284) generated by 33 physicians (31 faculty 
      members and 2 recent graduates from residency or fellowship programs) across 17 
      specialties, the median accuracy score was 5.5 (IQR, 4.0-6.0) (between almost 
      completely and complete correct) with a mean (SD) score of 4.8 (1.6) (between 
      mostly and almost completely correct). The median completeness score was 3.0 
      (IQR, 2.0-3.0) (complete and comprehensive) with a mean (SD) score of 2.5 (0.7). 
      For questions rated easy, medium, and hard, the median accuracy scores were 6.0 
      (IQR, 5.0-6.0), 5.5 (IQR, 5.0-6.0), and 5.0 (IQR, 4.0-6.0), respectively (mean 
      [SD] scores were 5.0 [1.5], 4.7 [1.7], and 4.6 [1.6], respectively; P = .05). 
      Accuracy scores for binary and descriptive questions were similar (median score, 
      6.0 [IQR, 4.0-6.0] vs 5.0 [IQR, 3.4-6.0]; mean [SD] score, 4.9 [1.6] vs 4.7 
      [1.6]; P = .07). Of 36 questions with scores of 1.0 to 2.0, 34 were requeried or 
      regraded 8 to 17 days later with substantial improvement (median score 2.0 [IQR, 
      1.0-3.0] vs 4.0 [IQR, 2.0-5.3]; P < .01). A subset of questions, regardless of 
      initial scores (version 3.5), were regenerated and rescored using version 4 with 
      improvement (mean accuracy [SD] score, 5.2 [1.5] vs 5.7 [0.8]; median score, 6.0 
      [IQR, 5.0-6.0] for original and 6.0 [IQR, 6.0-6.0] for rescored; P = .002). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, chatbot generated 
      largely accurate information to diverse medical queries as judged by academic 
      physician specialists with improvement over time, although it had important 
      limitations. Further research and model development are needed to correct 
      inaccuracies and for validation.

      Linear Weight Mapping and Update in Neuromorphic Computing Systems.
PG  - 47229-47237
LID - 10.1021/acsami.3c09162 [doi]
AB  - Neuromorphic computing, an innovative technology inspired by the human brain, has 
      attracted increasing attention as a promising technology for the development of 
      artificial intelligence systems. This study proposes synaptic transistors with a 
      Li(1-x)Al(x)Ti(2-x)(PO(4))(3) (LATP) layer to analyze the conductance modulation 
      linearity, which is essential for weight mapping and updating during on-chip 
      learning processes. The high ionic conductivity of the LATP electrolyte provides 
      a large hysteresis window and enables linear weight update in synaptic devices. 
      The results demonstrate that optimizing the LATP layer thickness improves the 
      conductance modulation and linearity of synaptic transistors during potentiation 
      and degradation. A 20 nm-thick LATP layer results in the most nonlinear 
      depression (α(d) = -6.59), whereas a 100 nm-thick LATP layer results in the 
      smallest nonlinearity (α(d) = -2.22). Additionally, a device with the optimal 100 
      nm-thick LATP layer exhibits the highest average recognition accuracy of 94.8% 
      and the smallest fluctuation, indicating that the linearity characteristics of a 
      device play a crucial role in weight update during learning and can significantly 
      affect the recognition accuracy.

      Facial Reanimation Surgery: A Review.
PG  - 556-561
LID - 10.1089/fpsam.2022.0424 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Surgeons treating facial paralysis with reanimation surgery measure 
      the outcomes of surgery and adjust treatment to each patient's needs. Our 
      objective is to review the current subjective facial paralysis assessment tools 
      and the emerging computer-based objective analysis, which may involve artificial 
      intelligence. Observations: In recent years, many new automated approaches to 
      outcome measurement in facial reanimation surgery have been developed. Most of 
      these tools utilize artificial intelligence to analyze emotional expression and 
      symmetry of facial landmarks. Other tools have provided automated approaches to 
      existing clinician-guided scales. Conclusions: Newly developed computer-based 
      tools using artificial intelligence have been developed to both improve existing 
      clinician-graded scales and provide new approaches to facial symmetry and 
      emotional expressivity analysis.

AB  - Brain-inspired neuromorphic computing is currently being investigated for 
      effective artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The development of artificial 
      neurons and synapses is imperative to creating efficient computational biomimetic 
      networks. Here we propose the minimal configuration of an effective iontronic 
      spiking neuron based on a conical nanofluidic pore ionic diode. The conductance 
      is composed of a Boltzmann open channel probability and a blocking inactivation 
      function, forming the structure of a memristor. The presence of a negative 
      resistance and the combination of activation-deactivation dynamics cause a Hopf 
      bifurcation. Using the characteristic frequencies of small perturbation impedance 
      spectroscopy, we discuss the conditions of spiking, in which the system enters a 
      limit cycle oscillation. We arrive at the conclusion that an excitable 
      neuron-like system can be made with a single active channel instead of the more 
      complex combination of multiple channels that occurs in the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron 
      model.
