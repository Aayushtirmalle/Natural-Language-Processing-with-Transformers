TI  - Characterizing orthodontic tooth movement in real time using dental monitoring 
      scans: A pilot study.
PG  - 82-91
LID - 10.1111/ocr.12717 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This pilot study aimed to quantify the magnitude and type of tooth 
      movement occurring in short time intervals within the regular monthly orthodontic 
      visits for patients with fixed appliances and undergoing maxillary canine 
      retraction. Additionally, this pilot study aimed to provide a descriptive 
      evaluation for the accuracy and reliability of the Dental Monitoring 
      (DM)-captured scans to those of an iTero digital scans in an extraction space 
      closure model. SETTINGS AND SAMPLE POPULATION: 3D intraoral photographic scans 
      (DM) for 12 patients with maxillary first premolar extractions in a single-centre 
      academic institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients treated with fixed 
      appliances and undergoing space closure for maxillary premolar extraction(s) were 
      included. Nickel-titanium (200 g) closing coil springs were used for canine 
      retraction. At initiation of space closure (T1), iTero scans were acquired, and 
      patients were instructed to take DM scans every 4-5 days until their next visit 
      in 4-5 weeks (T2). At T2, a final iTero scan in addition to a DM scan was taken. 
      The number of patients who did the scans regularly as instructed declined as time 
      elapsed. Stereolithography (STL) files generated from the DM scans were 
      superimposed with the STL files from the iTero scans using GOM Inspect software 
      to determine the accuracy of the DM 3D models. To assess rate, type and direction 
      of tooth movement, each of the 3D image STL files generated from the DM scans, 
      taken every 4-5 days by each patient, was superimposed on the previously captured 
      scan. The rate of tooth movement for the maxillary molars and canines was 
      calculated in the 3 planes of space (X, Y, Z) at each time point, until the end 
      of the experiment. RESULTS: Preliminary results indicated that the maxillary 
      canines appeared to be displaced the greatest amount in the first 4-5 days with 
      initial distolateral movement. As time elapsed, the rate of tooth movement 
      decreased, and the tooth started moving distolingually. CONCLUSIONS: Dental 
      monitoring software provides a high-tech platform to monitor tooth movement in a 
      'real-time' approach. Accuracy of the photographic scans in relationship to the 
      intraoral scans appears promising. There seems to be some evidence that the 
      greatest amount of movement occurs initially in the first few days after 
      activation, dropping thereafter to become a slower constant rate of tooth 
      movement.

TI  - External validation, radiological evaluation, and development of deep learning 
      automatic lung segmentation in contrast-enhanced chest CT.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-023-10235-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is a need for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) lung segmentation 
      models. Clinical translation requires radiological evaluation of model outputs, 
      understanding of limitations, and identification of failure points. This 
      multicentre study aims to develop an accurate CTPA lung segmentation model, with 
      evaluation of outputs in two diverse patient cohorts with pulmonary hypertension 
      (PH) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). METHODS: This retrospective study 
      develops an nnU-Net-based segmentation model using data from two specialist 
      centres (UK and USA). Model was trained (n = 37), tested (n = 12), and clinically 
      evaluated (n = 176) on a diverse 'real-world' cohort of 225 PH patients with 
      volumetric CTPAs. Dice score coefficient (DSC) and normalised surface distance 
      (NSD) were used for testing. Clinical evaluation of outputs was performed by two 
      radiologists who assessed clinical significance of errors. External validation 
      was performed on heterogenous contrast and non-contrast scans from 28 ILD 
      patients. RESULTS: A total of 225 PH and 28 ILD patients with diverse demographic 
      and clinical characteristics were evaluated. Mean accuracy, DSC, and NSD scores 
      were 0.998 (95% CI 0.9976, 0.9989), 0.990 (0.9840, 0.9962), and 0.983 (0.9686, 
      0.9972) respectively. There were no segmentation failures. On radiological 
      review, 82% and 71% of internal and external cases respectively had no errors. 
      Eighteen percent and 25% respectively had clinically insignificant errors. 
      Peripheral atelectasis and consolidation were common causes for suboptimal 
      segmentation. One external case (0.5%) with patulous oesophagus had a clinically 
      significant error. CONCLUSION: State-of-the-art CTPA lung segmentation model 
      provides accurate outputs with minimal clinical errors on evaluation across two 
      diverse cohorts with PH and ILD. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical translation of 
      artificial intelligence models requires radiological review and understanding of 
      model limitations. This study develops an externally validated state-of-the-art 
      model with robust radiological review. Intended clinical use is in techniques 
      such as lung volume or parenchymal disease quantification. KEY POINTS: • 
      Accurate, externally validated CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) lung segmentation 
      model tested in two large heterogeneous clinical cohorts (pulmonary hypertension 
      and interstitial lung disease). • No segmentation failures and robust review of 
      model outputs by radiologists found 1 (0.5%) clinically significant segmentation 
      error. • Intended clinical use of this model is a necessary step in techniques 
      such as lung volume, parenchymal disease quantification, or pulmonary vessel 
      analysis.

TI  - Validation of a real-time biliopancreatic endoscopic ultrasonography analytical 
      device in China: a prospective, single-centre, randomised, controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a key procedure for the diagnosis 
      of biliopancreatic diseases. However, the performance among EUS endoscopists 
      varies greatly and leads to blind spots during the operation, which can impair 
      the health outcomes of patients. We previously developed an artificial 
      intelligence (AI) device that accurately identified EUS standard stations and 
      significantly reduced the difficulty of ultrasonography image interpretation. In 
      this study, we updated the device (named EUS-IREAD) and validated its performance 
      in improving the quality of EUS procedures. METHODS: In this single-centre, 
      randomised, controlled trial, we updated EUS-IREAD so it consisted of five 
      learning models to identify eight EUS stations and 24 anatomical structures. The 
      trial was done at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) and 
      included patients aged 18 years or older with suspected biliopancreatic (pancreas 
      and biliopancreatic duct) lesions due to clinical symptoms, radiological 
      findings, or laboratory findings, and with a high risk of pancreatic cancer. 
      Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a dedicated research assistant using a 
      computer-generated random number series (with a block size of four) to undergo 
      the EUS procedure with or without the assistance of EUS-IREAD. Endoscopists in 
      the EUS-IREAD-assisted group were required to observe all standard stations and 
      anatomical structures according to the prompts by the AI device. Data collectors, 
      the independent data anaylsis team, and patients were masked to group allocation. 
      The primary outcome was the missed scanning rate of standard stations between the 
      two groups, which was assessed in patients who underwent EUS procedure in 
      accordance with the assigned intervention (per protocol). This trial is 
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05457101. FINDINGS: Between July 9, 2022, 
      and Feb 28, 2023, 290 patients (mean age 55·93 years [SD 14·06], 152 [52%] male, 
      and 138 [48%] female) were randomly assigned and analysed, including 144 in the 
      EUS-IREAD-assisted group and 146 in the control group. The EUS-IREAD-assisted 
      group had a lower missed scanning rate of stations than the control group (4·5% 
      [SD 0·8] vs 14·3% [1·0], -9·8% [95% CI -12·2 to -7·5]; odds ratio 3·6 [95% Cl 2·6 
      to 4·9]; p<0·0001). No significant adverse event was found during the study. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our study confirms the capability of EUS-IREAD to monitor the 
      blind spots and reduce the missed rate of stations and structures during EUS 
      procedures. The EUS-IREAD has the potential to play an essential part in EUS 
      quality control. FUNDING: Innovation Team Project of Health Commission of Hubei

      Blindness! registry in Zurich were processed at baseline, and after initial 
      treatment using intravitreal anti-VEGF to predict subsequent 1-year and 4-year 
      outcomes. Intraretinal and subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment 
      volumes were segmented using a deep learning algorithm (Vienna Fluid Monitor, 
      RetInSight, Vienna, Austria). A predictive machine learning model for future 
      treatment requirements and morphological outcomes was built using the computed 
      set of quantitative features. RESULTS: Two hundred and two eyes from 158 patients 
      were evaluated. 107 eyes had a lower median (≤7) and 95 eyes had an upper median 
      (≥8) number of injections in the first year, with a mean accuracy of prediction 
      of 0.77 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.83) area under the curve (AUC). Best-corrected visual 
      acuity at baseline was the most relevant predictive factor determining final 
      visual outcomes after 1 year. Over 4 years, half of the eyes had progressed to 
      macular atrophy (MA) with the model being able to distinguish MA from non-MA eyes 
      with a mean AUC of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.79). Prediction for subretinal fibrosis 
      reached an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The regulatory 
      approved AI-based fluid monitoring allows clinicians to use automated algorithms 
      in prospectively guided patient treatment in AMD. Furthermore, retinal fluid 
      localisation and quantification can predict long-term morphological outcomes.

TI  - Comparison of humans versus mobile phone-powered artificial intelligence for the

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of skin cancer requires medical expertise, which is scarce. 
      Mobile phone-powered artificial intelligence (AI) could aid diagnosis, but it is 
      unclear how this technology performs in a clinical scenario. Our primary aim was 
      to test in the clinic whether there was equivalence between AI algorithms and 
      clinicians for the diagnosis and management of pigmented skin lesions. METHODS: 
      In this multicentre, prospective, diagnostic, clinical trial, we included 
      specialist and novice clinicians and patients from two tertiary referral centres 
      in Australia and Austria. Specialists had a specialist medical qualification 
      related to diagnosing and managing pigmented skin lesions, whereas novices were 
      dermatology junior doctors or registrars in trainee positions who had experience 
      in examining and managing these lesions. Eligible patients were aged 18-99 years 
      and had a modified Fitzpatrick I-III skin type; those in the diagnostic trial 
      were undergoing routine excision or biopsy of one or more suspicious pigmented 
      skin lesions bigger than 3 mm in the longest diameter, and those in the 
      management trial had baseline total-body photographs taken within 1-4 years. We 
      used two mobile phone-powered AI instruments incorporating a simple optical 
      attachment: a new 7-class AI algorithm and the International Skin Imaging 
      Collaboration (ISIC) AI algorithm, which was previously tested in a large online 
      reader study. The reference standard for excised lesions in the diagnostic trial 
      was histopathological examination; in the management trial, the reference 
      standard was a descending hierarchy based on histopathological examination, 
      comparison of baseline total-body photographs, digital monitoring, and 
      telediagnosis. The main outcome of this study was to compare the accuracy of 
      expert and novice diagnostic and management decisions with the two AI 
      instruments. Possible decisions in the management trial were dismissal, biopsy, 
      or 3-month monitoring. Decisions to monitor were considered equivalent to 
      dismissal (scenario A) or biopsy of malignant lesions (scenario B). The trial was 
      registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
      ACTRN12620000695909 (Universal trial number U1111-1251-8995). FINDINGS: The 
      diagnostic study included 172 suspicious pigmented lesions (84 malignant) from 
      124 patients and the management study included 5696 pigmented lesions (18 
      malignant) from the whole body of 66 high-risk patients. The diagnoses of the 
      7-class AI algorithm were equivalent to the specialists' diagnoses (absolute 
      accuracy difference 1·2% [95% CI -6·9 to 9·2]) and significantly superior to the 
      novices' ones (21·5% [13·1 to 30·0]). The diagnoses of the ISIC AI algorithm were 
      significantly inferior to the specialists' diagnoses (-11·6% [-20·3 to -3·0]) but 
      significantly superior to the novices' ones (8·7% [-0·5 to 18·0]). The best 
      7-class management AI was significantly inferior to specialists' management 
      (absolute accuracy difference in correct management decision -0·5% [95% CI -0·7 
      to -0·2] in scenario A and -0·4% [-0·8 to -0·05] in scenario B). Compared with 
      the novices' management, the 7-class management AI was significantly inferior 
      (-0·4% [-0·6 to -0·2]) in scenario A but significantly superior (0·4% [0·0 to 
      0·9]) in scenario B. INTERPRETATION: The mobile phone-powered AI technology is 
      simple, practical, and accurate for the diagnosis of suspicious pigmented skin 
      cancer in patients presenting to a specialist setting, although its usage for 
      management decisions requires more careful execution. An AI algorithm that was 
      superior in experimental studies was significantly inferior to specialists in a 
      real-world scenario, suggesting that caution is needed when extrapolating results 
      of experimental studies to clinical practice. FUNDING: MetaOptima Technology.

TI  - Automated Measurements of Interscrew Angles in Vertebral Body Tethering Patients 
      with Deep Learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebral body tethering is the most popular nonfusion 
      treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The effect of the tether cord on 
      the spine can be segmentally assessed by comparing the angle between two adjacent 
      screws (interscrew angle) over time. Tether breakage has historically been 
      assessed radiographically by a change in adjacent interscrew angle by greater 
      than 5 degrees between two sets of imaging. A threshold for growth modulation has 
      not yet been established in the literature. These angle measurements are time 
      consuming and prone to interobserver variability. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      study was to develop an automated deep learning algorithm for measuring the 
      interscrew angle following VBT surgery. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single institution 
      analysis of medical images. PATIENT SAMPLE: We analyzed 229 standing or bending 
      AP or PA radiographs from 100 patient who had undergone VBT at our institution. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Physiologic Measures: An image processing algorithm was used to 
      measure interscrew angles. METHODS: 229 standing or bending AP or PA radiographs 
      from 100 VBT patients with vertebral body tethers were identified. Vertebral body 
      screws were segmented by hand for all images and interscrew angles measured 
      manually for 60 of the included images. A U-Net deep learning model was developed 
      to automatically segment the vertebral body screws. Screw label maps were used to 
      develop and tune an image processing algorithm which measures interscrew angles. 
      Finally, the completed model and algorithm pipeline was tested on a 30-image test 
      set. Dice score and absolute error were used to measure performance. RESULTS: 
      Inter- and Intra-rater reliability for manual angle measurements were assessed 
      with ICC and were both 0.99. The segmentation model Dice score against manually 
      segmented ground truth across the 30-image test set was 0.96. The average 
      interscrew angle absolute error between the algorithm and manually measured 
      ground truth was 0.66 degrees and ranged from 0 to 2.67 degrees in 
      non-overlapping screws (N=206). The primary modes of failure for the model were 
      overlapping screws on a right thoracic/left lumbar construct with two screws in 
      one vertebra and overexposed images. An algorithm step which determines whether 
      an overlapping screw was present correctly identified all overlapping screws, 
      with no false positives. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an algorithm 
      which measures interscrew angles for radiographs of vertebral body tether 
      patients with an accuracy of within 1 degree for the majority of interscrew 
      angles. The algorithm can process 5 images per second on a standard computer, 
      leading to substantial time savings. This algorithm may be used for rapid 
      processing of large radiographic databases of tether patients and could enable 
      more rigorous definitions of growth modulation and cord breakage to be 
      established.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of cancer remains an unmet need in clinical practice, 
      and high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity biomarkers are urgently required. 
      Here, we attempted to identify secreted proteins encoded by super-enhancer 
      (SE)-driven genes as diagnostic biomarkers for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
      (ESCC). METHODS: We conducted an integrative analysis of multiple data sets 
      including ChIP-seq data, secretome data, CCLE data and GEO data to screen 
      secreted proteins encoded by SE-driven genes. Using ELISA, we further identified 
      up-regulated secreted proteins through a small size of clinical samples and 
      verified in a multi-centre validation stage (345 in test cohort and 231 in 
      validation cohort). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to 
      calculate diagnostic accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) method named gradient 
      boosting machine (GBM) were applied for model construction to enhance diagnostic 
      accuracy. RESULTS: Serum EFNA1 and MMP13 were identified, and showed 
      significantly higher levels in ESCC patients compared to normal controls. An 
      integrated Five-Biomarker Panel (iFBPanel) established by combining EFNA1, MMP13, 
      carcino-embryonic antigen, Cyfra21-1 and squmaous cell carcinoma antigen had AUCs 
      of 0.881 and 0.880 for ESCC in test and validation cohorts, respectively. 
      Importantly, the iFBPanel also exhibited good performance in detecting 
      early-stage ESCC patients (0.872 and 0.864). Furthermore, the iFBPanel was 
      further empowered by AI technology which showed excellent diagnostic performance 
      in early-stage ESCC (0.927 and 0.907). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that 
      serum EFNA1 and MMP13 could potentially assist ESCC detection, and provided an 
      easy-to-use detection model that might help the diagnosis of early-stage ESCC.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop an algorithm to predict intraoperative Red Blood Cell 
      (RBC) transfusion from preoperative variables contained in the electronic medical 
      record of our institution, with the goal of guiding type and screen ordering. 
      DESIGN: Machine Learning model development on retrospective single-center 
      hospital data. SETTING: Preoperative period and operating room. PATIENTS: The 
      study included patients ≥18 years old who underwent surgery during 2019-2022 and 
      excluded those who refused transfusion, underwent emergency surgery, or surgery 
      for organ donation after cardiac or brain death. INTERVENTION: Prediction of 
      intraoperative transfusion vs. no intraoperative transfusion. MEASUREMENTS: The 
      outcome variable was intraoperative transfusion of RBCs. Predictive variables 
      were surgery, surgeon, anesthesiologist, age, sex, body mass index, race or 
      ethnicity, preoperative hemoglobin (g/dL), partial thromboplastin time (s), 
      platelet count x 10(9) per liter, and prothrombin time. We compared the 
      performances of seven machine learning algorithms. After training and 
      optimization on the 2019-2021 dataset, model thresholds were set to the current 
      institutional performance level of sensitivity (93%). To qualify for comparison, 
      models had to maintain clinically relevant sensitivity (>90%) when predicting on 
      2022 data; overall accuracy was the comparative metric. MAIN RESULTS: Out of 
      100,813 cases that met study criteria from 2019 to 2021, intraoperative 
      transfusion occurred in 5488 (5.4%) of cases. The LightGBM model was the highest 
      performing algorithm in external temporal validity experiments, with overall 
      accuracy of (76.1%) [95% confidence interval (CI), 75.6-76.5], while maintaining 
      clinically relevant sensitivity of (91.2%) [95% CI, 89.8-92.5]. If type and 
      screens were ordered based upon the LightGBM model, the predicted type and screen 
      to transfusion ratio would improve from 8.4 to 5.1. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning 
      approaches are feasible in predicting intraoperative transfusion from 
      preoperative variables and may improve preoperative type and screen ordering 
      practices when incorporated into the electronic health record.
