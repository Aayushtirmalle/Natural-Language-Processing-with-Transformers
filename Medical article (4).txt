TI  - Children's Motor Intelligence Evaluation System Based on Multi-data Fusion.

AB  - Along with the main feedback information of early childhood education activities, 
      children's movement evaluation plays an important guiding role in early childhood 
      education activities. Teachers can teach children in accordance with their 
      aptitude according to the results of children's sports evaluation. Traditional 
      physical education overemphasizes the leading role of teachers, and young 
      children can only passively receive the education of teachers. Teachers always 
      use the same standard to evaluate each child, simply assigning a rating of 
      "strong," "moderate," and "poor" to children, ignoring the differences in 
      children's physical intelligence. The emergence of multidata fusion technology 
      can use the differences and complementarity of various data in evaluation 
      functions to make up for the insufficiency of a single exercise evaluation 
      result, purposefully choose the evaluation method flexibly according to the 
      content of the exercise and the scene of the exercise, and gradually improve the 
      level of children's exercise evaluation. This paper studied the children's motor 
      intelligence evaluation system based on multidata fusion. To this end, this paper 
      will focus on children's autonomous sports games and determine the first-level 
      indicators in the children's sports evaluation index system as four indicators: 
      classroom performance, physical fitness, motor skills, and extracurricular 
      fitness. It used the principle of multidata fusion, firstly evaluates children's 
      exercise physiology data through a fuzzy neural network algorithm, and then 
      combines the adaptive weighted data fusion algorithm with D-S evidence theory to 
      evaluate children's movement intelligence. Experiments showed that the multidata 
      evaluation system can take effective measures to intelligently evaluate 
      children's comprehensive motor ability. Compared with the traditional evaluation 
      method, the evaluation results are increased by 5%, and the children's sports 
      evaluation results are more average, which can enhance children's sports 
      confidence and promote children's effective exercise.

AB  - The potential for robots to support education is being increasingly studied and 
      rapidly realised. However, most research evaluating education robots has 
      neglected to examine the fundamental features that make them more or less 
      effective, given the needs and expectations of learners. This study explored how 
      children's perceptions, expectations and experiences are shaped by aesthetic and 
      functional features during interactions with different robot 'reading buddies'. 
      We collected a range of quantitative and qualitative measures of subjective 
      experience before and after children read a book with one of three different 
      robots. An inductive thematic analysis revealed that robots have the potential 
      offer children an engaging and non-judgemental social context to promote reading 
      engagement. This was supported by children's perceptions of robots as being 
      intelligent enough to read, listen and comprehend the story, particularly when 
      they had the capacity to talk. A key challenge in the use of robots for this 
      purpose was the unpredictable nature of robot behaviour, which remains difficult 
      to perfectly control and time using either human operators or autonomous 
      algorithms. Consequently, some children found the robots' responses distracting. 
      We provide recommendations for future research seeking to position seemingly 
      sentient and intelligent robots as an assistive tool within and beyond education 
      settings.

TI  - The role of intelligence in decision-making in early adolescence.
PG  - 101-111
LID - 10.1111/bjdp.12261 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the role of intelligence and its development across 
      childhood in decision-making in adolescence (age 11 years). The sample was 12,514 
      children from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, followed at ages 3, 5, 7, and 
      11 years. Decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making, risk 
      adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the 
      Cambridge Gambling Task. Even after adjustment for confounding, intelligence was 
      positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making in both 
      boys and girls. Furthermore, in girls risk adjustment was related positively to 
      IQ gains. Our findings suggest that there are important, substantively, 
      associations between intelligence and adapting behaviour to risk at the cusp of 
      adolescence, the period when the response to risk can shape life trajectories. 
      Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject In children, 
      intelligence and decision-making, measured with gambling tasks, are 
      inconsistently linked. This could be due to gambling tasks not separating 
      risk-taking from contingency-learning. What the present study adds This study 
      measured 11-year-olds' decision-making using a gambling task in which 
      probabilities of different outcomes are presented explicitly. IQ was positively 
      associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making. Also significant 
      were IQ gains (for risk adjustment, only in girls). There are links between 
      intelligence and adapting behaviour to statistical risk in children.

TI  - Causal associations of intelligence with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: A 
      Mendelian randomization analysis.
PG  - e61
LID - 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.2237 [doi]
LID - e61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intelligence is inversely associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 
      bipolar disorder (BD); it remains unclear whether low intelligence is a cause or 
      consequence. We investigated causal associations of intelligence with SCZ or BD 
      risk and a shared risk between SCZ and BD and SCZ-specific risk. METHODS: To 
      estimate putative causal associations, we performed multi-single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) Mendelian randomization (MR) using generalized 
      summary-data-based MR (GSMR). Summary-level datasets from five GWASs 
      (intelligence, SCZ vs. control [CON], BD vs. CON, SCZ + BD vs. CON, and SCZ vs. 
      BD; sample sizes of up to 269,867) were utilized. RESULTS: A strong bidirectional 
      association between risks for SCZ and BD was observed (odds ratio; 
      ORSCZ → BD = 1.47, p = 2.89 × 10-41, ORBD → SCZ = 1.44, p = 1.85 × 10-52). Low 
      intelligence was bidirectionally associated with a high risk for SCZ, with a 
      stronger effect of intelligence on SCZ risk (ORlower intelligence → SCZ = 1.62, 
      p = 3.23 × 10-14) than the reverse (ORSCZ → lower intelligence = 1.06, 
      p = 3.70 × 10-23). Furthermore, low intelligence affected a shared risk between 
      SCZ and BD (OR lower intelligence → SCZ + BD = 1.23, p = 3.41 × 10-5) and 
      SCZ-specific risk (ORlower intelligence → SCZvsBD = 1.64, p = 9.72 × 10-10); the 
      shared risk (ORSCZ + BD → lower intelligence = 1.04, p = 3.09 × 10-14) but not 
      SCZ-specific risk (ORSCZvsBD → lower intelligence = 1.00, p = 0.88) weakly 
      affected low intelligence. Conversely, there was no significant causal 
      association between intelligence and BD risk (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings support observational studies showing that patients with SCZ display 
      impairment in premorbid intelligence and intelligence decline. Moreover, a shared 
      factor between SCZ and BD might contribute to impairment in premorbid 
      intelligence and intelligence decline but SCZ-specific factors might be affected 
      by impairment in premorbid intelligence. We suggest that patients with these 
      genetic factors should be categorized as having a cognitive disorder SCZ or BD 
      subtype.

      Issues.
LID - 10.3390/s22186995 [doi]
LID - 6995
AB  - Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has been attracting great interest from 
      both academia and industry due to its huge potential impact on improving driving 
      experiences and enabling better transportation systems. While a large number of 
      interesting IoV applications are expected, it is more challenging to design an 
      efficient IoV system compared with conventional Internet of Things (IoT) 
      applications due to the mobility of vehicles and complex road conditions. We 
      discuss existing studies about enabling collaborative intelligence in IoV systems 
      by focusing on collaborative communications, collaborative computing, and 
      collaborative machine learning approaches. Based on comparison and discussion 
      about the advantages and disadvantages of recent studies, we point out open 
      research issues and future research directions.

AB  - Genetic quality may be expressed through many traits simultaneously, and this 
      would suggest a phenotype-wide fitness factor. In humans, intelligence has been 
      positively associated with several potential indicators of genetic quality, 
      including ejaculate quality. We conducted a conceptual replication of one such 
      study by investigating the relationship between intelligence (assessed by the 
      Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices Test-Short Form) and ejaculate quality 
      (indexed by sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility) in a sample of 
      41 men (ages ranging 18 to 33 years; M = 23.33; SD = 3.60). By self-report, 
      participants had not had a vasectomy, and had never sought infertility treatment. 
      We controlled for several covariates known to affect ejaculate quality (e.g., 
      abstinence duration before providing an ejaculate) and found no statistically 
      significant relationship between intelligence and ejaculate quality; our 
      findings, therefore, do not match those of Arden, Gottfredson, Miller et al. or 
      those of previous studies. We discuss limitations of this study and the general 
      research area and highlight the need for future research in this area, especially 
      the need for larger data sets to address questions around phenotypic quality and 
      ejaculate quality.

AB  - The relationship between humans and technology has attracted increasing attention 
      with the advent of ever stronger models of artificial intelligence. Humans and 
      technology are intertwined within multiple autopoietic loops of stress, care, and 
      intelligence. This paper suggests that technology should not be seen as a mere 
      tool serving humans' needs, but rather as a partner in a rich relationship with 
      humans. Our model for understanding autopoietic systems applies equally to 
      biological, technological, and hybrid systems. Regardless of their substrates, 
      all intelligent agents can be understood as needing to respond to a perceived 
      mismatch between what is and what should be. We take this observation, which is 
      evidence of intrinsic links between ontology and ethics, as the basis for 
      proposing a stress-care-intelligence feedback loop (SCI loop for short). We note 
      that the SCI loop provides a perspective on agency that does not require recourse 
      to explanatorily burdensome notions of permanent and singular essences. SCI loops 
      can be seen as individuals only by virtue of their dynamics, and are thus 
      intrinsically integrative and transformational. We begin by considering the 
      transition from poiesis to autopoiesis in Heidegger and the subsequent enactivist 
      tradition, and on this basis formulate and explain the SCI loop. In an 
      acknowledgment of Maturana's and Varela's project, our findings are considered 
      against the backdrop of a classic Buddhist model for the cultivation of 
      intelligence, known as the bodhisattva. We conclude by noting that SCI loops of 
      human and technological agency can be seen as mutually integrative by noticing 
      the stress-transfers between them. The loop framework thus acknowledges 
      encounters and interactions between humans and technology in a way that does not 
      relegate one to the subservience of the other (neither in ontological nor in 
      ethical terms), suggesting instead integration and mutual respect as the default 
      for their engagements. Moreover, an acknowledgment of diverse, multiscale 
      embodiments of intelligence suggests an expansive model of ethics not bound by 
      artificial, limited criteria based on privileged composition or history of an 
      agent. The implications for our journey into the future appear numerous.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies reporting that highly intelligent individuals have more 
      mental health disorders often have sampling bias, no or inadequate control 
      groups, or insufficient sample size. We addressed these caveats by examining the 
      difference in the prevalence of mental health disorders between individuals with 
      high and average general intelligence (g-factor) in the UK Biobank. METHODS: 
      Participants with g-factor scores standardized relative to the same-age UK 
      population, were divided into two groups: a high g-factor group (g-factor 2 SD 
      above the UK mean; N = 16,137) and an average g-factor group (g-factor within 2 
      SD of the UK mean; N = 236,273). Using self-report questionnaires and medical 
      diagnoses, we examined group differences in the prevalence of 32 phenotypes, 
      including mental health disorders, trauma, allergies, and other traits. RESULTS: 
      High and average g-factor groups differed across 15/32 phenotypes and did not 
      depend on sex and/or age. Individuals with high g-factors had less general 
      anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 0.69, 95% CI [0.64;0.74]) and post-traumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD; OR = 0.67, 95 %CI [0.61;0.74]), were less neurotic (β = -0.12, 
      95% CI [-0.15;-0.10]), less socially isolated (OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.80;0.90]), 
      and were less likely to have experienced childhood stressors and abuse, adulthood 
      stressors, or catastrophic trauma (OR = 0.69-0.90). However, they generally had 
      more allergies (e.g., eczema; OR = 1.13-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: The present study 
      provides robust evidence that highly intelligent individuals do not have more 
      mental health disorders than the average population. High intelligence even 
      appears as a protective factor for general anxiety and PTSD.

TI  - Emotional Intelligence and Its Relationship to Basic Psychological Needs: A 
      Structural Equation Model for Student Athletes.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191710687 [doi]
LID - 10687
AB  - This paper analyses the relationship between emotional intelligence (attention, 
      clarity and repair) and motivational mediators (relationships, autonomy and 
      perceived competence) of students of different degrees related to physical 
      activity and sports science. A structural equation model was estimated with a 
      sample of university students. The results of the model are representative of 
      this case study only and are not very generalizable due to the sample size. In 
      any case, the results obtained show that emotional intelligence predicts the 
      satisfaction of psychological needs for autonomy and competence in student 
      athletes. Therefore, these demonstrations point to a relationship between both 
      variables and highlight the importance of addressing this type of content in 
      university classrooms in order to increase the positive effects on the 
      psychosocial development and personal well-being of students.

TI  - Reinforcement Learning-Aided Edge Intelligence Framework for Delay-Sensitive 
      Industrial Applications.
LID - 10.3390/s22208001 [doi]
LID - 8001
AB  - With the advancement in next-generation communication technologies, the so-called 
      Tactile Internet is getting more attention due to its smart applications, such as 
      haptic-enabled teleoperation systems. The stringent requirements such as delay, 
      jitter, and packet loss of these delay-sensitive and loss-intolerant applications 
      make it more challenging to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of 
      Experience (QoE). In this regard, different haptic codec and control schemes were 
      proposed for QoS and QoE provisioning in the Tactile Internet. However, they 
      maximize the QoE while degrading the system's stability under varying delays and 
      high packet rates. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning-based 
      Intelligent Tactile Edge (ITE) framework to ensure both transparency and 
      stability of teleoperation systems with high packet rates and variable time delay 
      communication networks. The proposed ITE first estimates the network challenges, 
      including communication delay, jitter, and packet loss, and then utilizes a 
      Q-learning algorithm to select the optimal haptic codec scheme to reduce network 
      load. The proposed framework aims to explore the optimal relationship between QoS 
      and QoE parameters and make the tradeoff between stability and transparency 
      during teleoperations. The simulation result indicates that the proposed strategy 
      chooses the optimal scheme under different network impairments corresponding to 
      the congestion level in the communication network while improving the QoS and 
      maximizing the QoE. The end-to-end performance of throughput (1.5 Mbps) and 
      average RTT (70 ms) during haptic communication is achieved with a learning rate 
      and discounted factor value of 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. The results indicate 
      that the communication system can successfully achieve the QoS and QoE 
      requirements by employing the proposed ITE framework.
