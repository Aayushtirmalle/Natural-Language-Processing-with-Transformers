AB  - Biomicrofluidics, a subdomain of microfluidics, has been inspired by several 
      ideas from nature. However, while the basic inspiration for the same may be drawn 
      from the living world, the translation of all relevant essential functionalities 
      to an artificially engineered framework does not remain trivial. Here, we review 
      the recent progress in bio-inspired microfluidic systems via harnessing the 
      integration of experimental and simulation tools delving into the interface of 
      engineering and biology. Development of "on-chip" technologies as well as their 
      multifarious applications is subsequently discussed, accompanying the relevant 
      advancements in materials and fabrication technology. Pointers toward new 
      directions in research, including an amalgamated fusion of data-driven modeling 
      (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning) and physics-based 
      paradigm, to come up with a human physiological replica on a synthetic bio-chip 
      with due accounting of personalized features, are suggested. These are likely to 
      facilitate physiologically replicating disease modeling on an artificially 
      engineered biochip as well as advance drug development and screening in an 
      expedited route with the minimization of animal and human trials.

TI  - "Big Data" Analyses Underlie Clinical Discoveries at the Aortic Institute.
PG  - 427-440
LID - 10.59249/LNDZ2964 [doi]
AB  - This issue of the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine (YJBM) focuses on Big Data 
      and precision analytics in medical research. At the Aortic Institute at Yale New 
      Haven Hospital, the vast majority of our investigations have emanated from our 
      large, prospective clinical database of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm 
      (TAA), supplemented by ultra-large genetic sequencing files. Among the 
      fundamental clinical and scientific discoveries enabled by application of 
      advanced statistical and artificial intelligence techniques on these clinical and 
      genetic databases are the following: From analysis of Traditional "Big Data" 
      (Large data sets). 1. Ascending aortic aneurysms should be resected at 5 cm to 
      prevent dissection and rupture. 2. Indexing aortic size to height improves aortic 
      risk prognostication. 3. Aortic root dilatation is more malignant than 
      mid-ascending aortic dilatation. 4. Ascending aortic aneurysm patients with 
      bicuspid aortic valves do not carry the poorer prognosis previously postulated. 
      5. The descending and thoracoabdominal aorta are capable of rupture without 
      dissection. 6. Female patients with TAA do more poorly than male patients. 7. 
      Ascending aortic length is even better than aortic diameter at predicting 
      dissection. 8. A "silver lining" of TAA disease is the profound, lifelong 
      protection from atherosclerosis. From Modern "Big Data" Machine 
      Learning/Artificial Intelligence analysis: 1. Machine learning models for TAA: 
      outperforming traditional anatomic criteria. 2. Genetic testing for TAA and 
      dissection and discovery of novel causative genes. 3. Phenotypic genetic 
      characterization by Artificial Intelligence. 4. Panel of RNAs "detects" TAA. Such 
      findings, based on (a) long-standing application of advanced conventional 
      statistical analysis to large clinical data sets, and (b) recent application of 
      advanced machine learning/artificial intelligence to large genetic data sets at 
      the Yale Aortic Institute have advanced the diagnosis and medical and surgical 
      treatment of TAA.

TI  - ChatGPT and the Future of Journal Reviews: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 415-420
LID - 10.59249/SKDH9286 [doi]
AB  - The increasing volume of research submissions to academic journals poses a 
      significant challenge for traditional peer-review processes. To address this 
      issue, this study explores the potential of employing ChatGPT, an advanced large 
      language model (LLM), developed by OpenAI, as an artificial intelligence (AI) 
      reviewer for academic journals. By leveraging the vast knowledge and natural 
      language processing capabilities of ChatGPT, we hypothesize it may be possible to 
      enhance the efficiency, consistency, and quality of the peer-review process. This 
      research investigated key aspects of integrating ChatGPT into the journal review 
      workflow. We compared the critical analysis of ChatGPT, acting as an AI reviewer, 
      to human reviews for a single published article. Our methodological framework 
      involved subjecting ChatGPT to an intricate examination, wherein its evaluative 
      acumen was juxtaposed against human-authored reviews of a singular published 
      article. As this is a feasibility study, one article was reviewed, which was a 
      case report on scurvy. The entire article was used as an input into ChatGPT and 
      commanded it to "Please perform a review of the following article and give points 
      for revision." Since this was a case report with a limited word count the entire 
      article could fit in one chat box. The output by ChatGPT was then compared with 
      the comments by human reviewers. Key performance metrics, including precision and 
      overall agreement, were judiciously and subjectively measured to portray the 
      efficacy of ChatGPT as an AI reviewer in comparison to its human counterparts. 
      The outcomes of this rigorous analysis unveiled compelling evidence regarding 
      ChatGPT's performance as an AI reviewer. We demonstrated that ChatGPT's critical 
      analyses aligned with those of human reviewers, as evidenced by the inter-rater 
      agreement. Notably, ChatGPT exhibited commendable capability in identifying 
      methodological flaws, articulating insightful feedback on theoretical frameworks, 
      and gauging the overall contribution of the articles to their respective fields. 
      While the integration of ChatGPT showcased immense promise, certain challenges 
      and caveats surfaced. For example, ambiguities might present with complex 
      research articles, leading to nuanced discrepancies between AI and human reviews. 
      Also figures and images cannot be reviewed by ChatGPT. Lengthy articles need to 
      be reviewed in parts by ChatGPT as the entire article will not fit in one 
      chat/response. The benefits consist of reduction in time needed by journals to 
      review the articles submitted to them, as well as an AI assistant to give a 
      different perspective about the research papers other than the human reviewers. 
      In conclusion, this research contributes a groundbreaking foundation for 
      incorporating ChatGPT into the pantheon of journal reviewers. The delineated 
      guidelines distill key insights into operationalizing ChatGPT as a proficient 
      reviewer within academic journal frameworks, paving the way for a more efficient 
      and insightful review process.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence to Improve Patient Understanding of Radiology Reports.
PG  - 407-417
LID - 10.59249/NKOY5498 [doi]
AB  - Diagnostic imaging reports are generally written with a target audience of other 
      providers. As a result, the reports are written with medical jargon and technical 
      detail to ensure accurate communication. With implementation of the 21st Century 
      Cures Act, patients have greater and quicker access to their imaging reports, but 
      these reports are still written above the comprehension level of the average 
      patient. Consequently, many patients have requested reports to be conveyed in 
      language accessible to them. Numerous studies have shown that improving patient 
      understanding of their condition results in better outcomes, so driving 
      comprehension of imaging reports is essential. Summary statements, second 
      reports, and the inclusion of the radiologist's phone number have been proposed, 
      but these solutions have implications for radiologist workflow. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) has the potential to simplify imaging reports without 
      significant disruptions. Many AI technologies have been applied to radiology 
      reports in the past for various clinical and research purposes, but patient 
      focused solutions have largely been ignored. New natural language processing 
      technologies and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to improve 
      patient understanding of their imaging reports. However, LLMs are a nascent 
      technology and significant research is required before LLM-driven report 
      simplification is used in patient care.

PG  - 356-364
LID - 10.1007/s13337-023-00834-x [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by surprise and people and 
      organisations worldwide worked in some way or the other to combat the spread; 
      isolate from the infected and get back to normal life, as it was before the 
      pandemic hit. In this regard, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was at the centre of 
      control and prevention and have seen a vehement change in every aspect, 
      especially development of point-of-care testing for better and quick diagnosis. 
      Among different types of techniques developed, the most important was the RT-PCR 
      method of detection which detects nucleic acid of the virus in samples. RT-PCR is 
      a laboratory-based method requiring trained professionals and precise steps for 
      accurate testing. With the advent and spread of the pandemic, number of RT-PCR 
      diagnostic centres rose significantly, and the detection process became less 
      cumbersome, easy to use, ability to handle large volume of samples, more 
      accurate, less time-consuming, and cost-effective. Different industries developed 
      RT-PCR kits, reducing the efforts to prepare laboratory samples. Machines were 
      employed for labour-driven tasks in PCR testing. In addition, new age 
      technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, digital systems were combined 
      with RT-PCR for accurate and easy testing. In this review, point-of-care RT-PCR 
      methods, when the COVID-19 started, and the methods now, has been compared on the 
      basis of technological advancements.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving field of clinical virology, technological advancements 
      have always played a pivotal role in driving transformative changes. This 
      comprehensive review delves into the burgeoning integration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning into virological research 
      and practice. As we elucidate, these computational tools have significantly 
      enhanced diagnostic precision, therapeutic interventions, and epidemiological 
      monitoring. Through in-depth analyses of notable case studies, we showcase how 
      algorithms can optimize viral genome sequencing, accelerate drug discovery, and 
      offer predictive insights into viral outbreaks. However, with these advancements 
      come inherent challenges, particularly in data security, algorithmic biases, and 
      ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges head-on, we discuss potential 
      remedial measures and underscore the significance of interdisciplinary 
      collaboration between virologists, data scientists, and ethicists. Conclusively, 
      this review posits an outlook that anticipates a symbiotic relationship between 
      AI-driven tools and virology, heralding a new era of proactive and personalized 
      patient care.

AB  - During Basic screening, it is challenging, if not impossible to detect breast 
      cancer especially in the earliest stage of tumor development. However, measuring 
      the electrical impedance of biological tissue can detect abnormalities even 
      before being palpable. Thus, we used impedance characteristics data of various 
      breast tissue to develop a breast cancer screening tool guided and augmented by a 
      deep learning (DL). A DL algorithm was trained to ideally classify six classes of 
      breast cancer based on electrical impedance characteristics data of the breast 
      tissue. The tool correctly predicted breast cancer in data of patients whose 
      breast tissue impedance was reported to have been measured when other methods 
      detected no anomaly in the tissue. Furthermore, a DL-based approach using Long 
      Short-Term Memory (LSTM) effectively classified breast tissue with an accuracy of 
      96.67%. Thus, the DL algorithm and method we developed accurately augmented 
      breast tissue classification using electrical impedance and enhanced the ability 
      to detect and differentiate cancerous tissue in very early stages. However, more 
      data and pre-clinical is required to improve the accuracy of this early breast 
      cancer detection and differentiation tool.

TI  - AI based image analysis of red blood cells in oscillating microchannels.
PG  - 28576-28582
LID - 10.1039/d3ra04644c [doi]
AB  - The flow dynamics of red blood cells in vivo in blood capillaries and in vitro in 
      microfluidic channels is complex. Cells can obtain different shapes such as 
      discoid, parachute, slipper-like shapes and various intermediate states depending 
      on flow conditions and their viscoelastic properties. We use artificial 
      intelligence based analysis of red blood cells (RBCs) in an oscillating 
      microchannel to distinguish healthy red blood cells from red blood cells treated 
      with formaldehyde to chemically modify their viscoelastic behavior. We used 
      TensorFlow to train and validate a deep learning model and achieved a testing 
      accuracy of over 97%. This method is a first step to a non-invasive, label-free 
      characterization of diseased red blood cells and will be useful for diagnostic 
      purposes in haematology labs. This method provides quantitative data on the 
      number of affected cells based on single cell classification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A model to predict preoperative outcomes after percutaneous 
      nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with renal staghorn stones is developed to be an essential 
      preoperative consultation tool. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we constructed a 
      predictive model for one-time stone clearance after PCNL for renal staghorn 
      calculi, so as to predict the stone clearance rate of patients in one operation, 
      and provide a reference direction for patients and clinicians. METHODS: According 
      to the 175 patients with renal staghorn stones undergoing PCNL at two centers, 
      preoperative/postoperative variables were collected. After identifying 
      characteristic variables using PCA analysis to avoid overfitting. A predictive 
      model was developed for preoperative outcomes after PCNL in patients with renal 
      staghorn stones. In addition, we repeatedly cross-validated their model's 
      predictive efficacy and clinical application using data from two different 
      centers. RESULTS: The study included 175 patients from two centers treated with 
      PCNL. We used a training set and an external validation set. Radionics 
      characteristics, deep migration learning, clinical characteristics, and 
      DTL+Rad-signature were successfully constructed using machine learning based on 
      patients' pre/postoperative imaging characteristics and clinical variables using 
      minimum absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. In this study, 
      DTL-Rad signal was found to be the outstanding predictor of stone clearance in 
      patients with renal deer antler-like stones treated by PCNL. The DTL+Rad 
      signature showed good discriminatory ability in both the training and external 
      validation groups with AUC values of 0.871 (95% CI, 0.800-0.942) and 0.744 (95% 
      CI, 0.617-0.871). The decision curve demonstrated the radiographic model's 
      clinical utility and illustrated specificities of 0.935 and 0.806, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: We found a prediction model combining imaging characteristics, neural 
      networks, and clinical characteristics can be used as an effective preoperative 
      prediction method.
