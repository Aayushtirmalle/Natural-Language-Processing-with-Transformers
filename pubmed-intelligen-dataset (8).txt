TI  - Predictors and occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in children 
      undergoing noncardiac surgery: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 148-156
LID - 10.1002/ibra.12066 [doi]
AB  - In children after cardiac surgery, alterations in cognitive ability and behavior 
      are increasingly common, but whether postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) 
      occurs in children undergoing noncardiac surgery is not known. The present study 
      was performed to investigate the incidence rate and potential risk factors of 
      early neurocognitive dysfunction in children after noncardiac surgery. Two 
      hundred patients aged between 4 and 14 years old underwent elective noncardiac 
      surgery and 100 healthy age-matched controls were enrolled in this prospective 
      observational study. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence or 
      Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised were conducted 1 day before and 
      3 days after surgery. POCD was calculated and diagnosed as a combined Z score. 
      Any factors that differed between POCD and non-POCD group (p < 0.10) were tested 
      together by multivariate logistic regression analysis against the cognitive 
      outcome of patients, to find out the independent risk factors of POCD. The 
      general incidence of POCD was 15.6%. The univariate analysis revealed that POCD 
      was associated with general anesthesia, surgical and anesthesia duration, early 
      postoperative fever (EPF), and surgical history. However, only the history of 
      surgery (p = 0.029), anesthesia duration (p = 0.010), and EPF (p < 0.001) were 
      demonstrated to be independent risk factors for POCD. The occurrence rate of 
      early POCD after noncardiac surgery in children is 15.6%. Children who had 
      surgical history, longer anesthesia duration, or EPF are more prone to develop 
      POCD.

TI  - Dyslexia with and without Irlen syndrome: A study of influence on abilities and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor level.
PG  - 32-42
LID - 10.1002/ibra.12080 [doi]
AB  - The presence of comorbid Irlen syndrome (IS) in children with developmental 
      dyslexia (DD) may have an impact on their reading and cognitive abilities. 
      Furthermore, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was reported to be 
      expressed in brain areas involved in cognitive and visual processing. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate some cognitive abilities of a group of dyslexic 
      children with IS and to measure and compare the plasma BDNF level to dyslexic 
      children without IS and neurotypical (NT) children. The participants were 60 
      children with DD (30 in the DD + IS group; 30 in the DD group) and 30 NT 
      children. The Irlen reading perceptual scale, the Stanford Binet intelligence 
      scale, 4th ed, the dyslexia assessment test, and the Illinois test of 
      psycholinguistic abilities were used. The BDNF level was measured using the 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One-minute writing and visual closure deficits 
      were more prevalent, while phonemic segmentation deficits were less prevalent in 
      the DD + IS group compared to the DD group. The BDNF level in the DD groups was 
      lower than that in NT children (p < 0.001). Some reading and non-reading tasks 
      were influenced by the presence of a coexisting IS. The reduced BDNF level could 
      play a role in the deficits noticed in the abilities of children with DD.

TI  - The implementation of artificial intelligence in radiology: a narrative review of 
      patient perspectives.
PG  - 63-68
LID - 10.7861/fhj.2022-0097 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To synthesise research on the view of the public and patients of the use of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology investigations. METHODS: A literature 
      review of narrative synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies that 
      reported views of the public and patients toward the use of AI in radiology. 
      RESULTS: Only seven studies related to patient and public views were retrieved, 
      suggesting that this is an underexplored area of research. Two broad themes, of 
      confidence in the capabilities of AI, and the accountability and transparency of 
      AI, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Both optimism and concerns were expressed by 
      participants. Transparency in the implementation of AI, scientific validation, 
      clear regulation and accountability were expected. Combined human and AI 
      interpretation of imaging was strongly favoured over AI acting autonomously. The 
      review highlights the limited engagement of the public in the adoption of AI in a 
      radiology setting. Successful implementation of AI in this field will require 
      demonstrating not only adequate accuracy of the technology, but also its 
      acceptance by patients.

      promising future or a glimpse of hope?

AB  - Precision pharmacotherapy of diabetes requires judicious selection of the optimal 
      therapeutic agent for individual patients. Artificial intelligence (AI), a 
      swiftly expanding discipline, holds substantial potential to transform current 
      practices in diabetes diagnosis and management. This manuscript provides a 
      comprehensive review of contemporary research investigating drug responses in 
      patient subgroups, stratified via either supervised or unsupervised machine 
      learning approaches. The prevalent algorithmic workflow for investigating drug 
      responses using machine learning involves cohort selection, data processing, 
      predictor selection, development and validation of machine learning methods, 
      subgroup allocation, and subsequent analysis of drug response. Despite the 
      promising feature, current research does not yet provide sufficient evidence to 
      implement machine learning algorithms into routine clinical practice, due to a 
      lack of simplicity, validation, or demonstrated efficacy. Nevertheless, we 
      anticipate that the evolving evidence base will increasingly substantiate the 
      role of machine learning in molding precision pharmacotherapy for diabetes.

TI  - Leveraging machine learning to create user-friendly models to mitigate 
      appointment failure at dental school clinics.
PG  - 1735-1745
LID - 10.1002/jdd.13375 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: This study had a twofold outcome. The first aim was to 
      develop an efficient, machine learning (ML) model using data from a dental school 
      clinic (DSC) electronic health record (EHR). This model identified patients with 
      a high likelihood of failing an appointment and provided a user-friendly system 
      with a rating score that would alert clinicians and administrators of patients at 
      high risk of no-show appointments. The second aim was to identify key factors 
      with ML modeling that contributed to patient no-show appointments. METHODS: Using 
      de-identified data from a DSC EHR, eight ML algorithms were evaluated: simple 
      decision tree, bagging regressor classifier, random forest classifier, gradient 
      boosted regression, AdaBoost regression, XGBoost regression, neural network, and 
      logistic regression classifier. The performance of each model was assessed using 
      a confusion matrix with different threshold level of probability; precision, 
      recall and predicted accuracy on each threshold; receiver-operating 
      characteristic curve (ROC) and area under curve (AUC); as well as F1 score. 
      RESULTS: The ML models agreed on the threshold of probability score at 0.20-0.25 
      with Bagging classifier as the model that performed best with a F1 score of 0.41 
      and AUC of 0.76. Results showed a strong correlation between appointment failure 
      and appointment confirmation, patient's age, number of visits before the 
      appointment, total number of prior failed appointments, appointment lead time, as 
      well as the patient's total number of medical alerts. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, 
      the implementation of this user-friendly ML model can improve DSC workflow, 
      benefiting dental students learning outcomes and optimizing personalized patient 
      care.

TI  - What works in advocating for food advertising policy change across an english 
      region - a realist evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With increasing recognition of the role of commercial determinants of 
      health, local areas in England have sought to restrict the advertising of 
      products high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) on council-owned spaces, as part of 
      wider strategies to reduce obesity. While there is some evidence of the impact of 
      such policy change on behaviour, little is known about what works in the process 
      of implementing this policy change. METHODS: Guided by a realist evaluation 
      framework that explores the interaction between context, mechanism and outcomes, 
      this study aims to investigate the factors that influence the restriction of 
      outdoor advertising of HFSS products in one region in England. It refines a 
      programme theory co-produced with stakeholders from 14 local authorities within a 
      region and uses multiple data sources from each area with an in-depth examination 
      of four case study sites. Data sources include longitudinal realist interviews, 
      focus groups and surveys with policy advocates and policy stakeholders. Data were 
      analysed retroductively to understand the causal link between context, mechanism 
      and outcomes. RESULTS: Outcomes were driven by five dominant mechanisms: a 
      strategic and staggered approach to stakeholder engagement, gathering 
      intelligence, identifying policy champions, building relationships, reframing the 
      issue; and two secondary mechanisms of amplifying the issue and increasing public 
      will. These led to varied outcomes with no changes in formal policy position 
      within the evaluation period but draft policy guidance in place and changes in 
      political will demonstrated. Dominant context factors influencing change included 
      having a named and resourced policy advocate in place supported by an external 
      Community of Improvement and having existing aligned local objectives. 
      Organisational complexity and change, financial concerns, lack of local examples, 
      ideological positions and the pandemic were also influencing contextual factors. 
      CONCLUSION: Effecting policy change in this area requires the commitment of an 
      extended period and the valuing of short-term policy outcomes, such as increasing 
      political will. The importance of a resourced and well-supported policy advocate 
      to lead this work is fundamental and the commercially sensitive nature of this 
      policy change means that a complex interplay of mechanisms is required which may 
      be dominated by a strategically staggered approach to stakeholder engagement.

AB  - Digital pathology (DP) is being increasingly employed in cancer diagnostics, 
      providing additional tools for faster, higher-quality, accurate diagnosis. The 
      practice of diagnostic pathology has gone through a staggering transformation 
      wherein new tools such as digital imaging, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) 
      algorithms, and computer-aided diagnostic techniques are being used for 
      assisting, augmenting and empowering the computational histopathology and 
      AI-enabled diagnostics. This is paving the way for advancement in precision 
      medicine in cancer. Automated whole slide imaging (WSI) scanners are now 
      rendering diagnostic quality, high-resolution images of entire glass slides and 
      combining these images with innovative digital pathology tools is making it 
      possible to integrate imaging into all aspects of pathology reporting including 
      anatomical, clinical, and molecular pathology. The recent approvals of WSI 
      scanners for primary diagnosis by the FDA as well as the approval of prostate AI 
      algorithm has paved the way for starting to incorporate this exciting technology 
      for use in primary diagnosis. AI tools can provide a unique platform for 
      innovations and advances in anatomical and clinical pathology workflows. In this 
      review, we describe the milestones and landmark trials in the use of AI in 
      clinical pathology with emphasis on future directions.

TI  - Emotional intelligence, spelling performance and intelligence quotient 
      differences based on the executive function profile of schoolchildren.
PG  - 3879-3891
LID - 10.1111/ejn.16152 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of intelligence quotient 
      with spelling performance, executive functions and emotional intelligence and to 
      analyse the profiles in executive functions presented by the participants and the 
      differences at the level of intelligence quotient, spelling performance and 
      emotional intelligence. The sample consisted of 125 Spanish primary school 
      students (58 girls and 67 boys) in a rural environment, with a mean age of 10.92 
      (±.68) years. Intelligence quotient and spelling performance were measured using 
      the BADyG test; executive functions were assessed using the NIH EXAMINER battery 
      and emotional intelligence was assessed using the Bar-On questionnaire. The 
      results show a high correlation of intelligence quotient with spelling 
      performance, executive functions and two emotional intelligence dimensions 
      (adaptability and interpersonal). Two clusters were observed: a high executive 
      functions profile (n = 74, 59.7%), with high scores on all measured variables 
      (working memory, planning, cognitive flexibility, inhibition and verbal fluency), 
      and a low executive functions profile (n = 50, 40.3%) with low scores on all 
      executive functions-related variables. The multivariate analysis of variance 
      (MANCOVA) found variations between the different clusters in the intelligence 
      quotient, spelling performance and interpersonal emotional intelligence 
      variables, showing that students with a higher executive functions profile had a 
      higher intelligence quotient, spelling performance and interpersonal emotional 
      intelligence values. This study could help to better define what kind of teaching 
      methodology favours the development of academic performance in schoolchildren and 
      the connections between important educational aspects such as emotional 
      intelligence and executive functions.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have gained considerable momentum in the past 
      decade. Although at first the main task of the ANN paradigm was to tune the 
      connection weights in fixed-architecture networks, there has recently been 
      growing interest in evolving network architectures toward the goal of creating 
      artificial general intelligence. Lagging behind this trend, current ANN hardware 
      struggles for a balance between flexibility and efficiency but cannot achieve 
      both. Here, we report on a novel approach for the on-demand generation of complex 
      networks within a single memristor where multiple virtual nodes are created by 
      time multiplexing and the non-trivial topological features, such as 
      small-worldness, are generated by exploiting device dynamics with intrinsic 
      cycle-to-cycle variability. When used for reservoir computing, memristive complex 
      networks can achieve a noticeable increase in memory capacity a and respectable 
      performance boost compared to conventional reservoirs trivially implemented as 
      fully connected networks. This work expands the functionality of memristors for 
      ANN computing.
