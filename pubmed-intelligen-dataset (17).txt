TI  - 2D Materials Beyond Post-AI Era: Smart Fibers, Soft Robotics, and Single Atom 
      Catalysts.
PG  - e2307689
LID - 10.1002/adma.202307689 [doi]
AB  - Recent consecutive discoveries of various 2D materials have triggered significant 
      scientific and technological interests owing to their exceptional material 
      properties, originally stemming from 2D confined geometry. Ever-expanding library 
      of 2D materials can provide ideal solutions to critical challenges facing in 
      current technological trend of the fourth industrial revolution. Moreover, 
      chemical modification of 2D materials to customize their physical/chemical 
      properties can satisfy the broad spectrum of different specific requirements 
      across diverse application areas. This review focuses on three particular 
      emerging application areas of 2D materials: smart fibers, soft robotics, and 
      single atom catalysts (SACs), which hold immense potentials for academic and 
      technological advancements in the post-artificial intelligence (AI) era. Smart 
      fibers showcase unconventional functionalities including healthcare/environmental 
      monitoring, energy storage/harvesting, and antipathogenic protection in the forms 
      of wearable fibers and textiles. Soft robotics aligns with future trend to 
      overcome longstanding limitations of hard-material based mechanics by introducing 
      soft actuators and sensors. SACs are widely useful in energy storage/conversion 
      and environmental management, principally contributing to low carbon footprint 
      for sustainable post-AI era. Significance and unique values of 2D materials in 
      these emerging applications are highlighted, where the research group has devoted 
      research efforts for more than a decade.

TI  - A systematic review and knowledge mapping on ICT-based remote and automatic 
      COVID-19 patient monitoring and care.
PG  - 1047

AB  - BACKGROUND: e-Health has played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic in 
      primary health care. e-Health is the cost-effective and secure use of Information 
      and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support health and health-related 
      fields. Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, 
      non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange 
      of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and 
      facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This 
      study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote 
      monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of 
      COVID-19-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic literature 
      review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method 
      implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and 
      disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 
      pandemic. METHODS: The search included primary studies that were published 
      between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such 
      as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google 
      Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the 
      findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to 
      the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and 
      meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the 
      review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of 
      Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were 
      methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in 
      e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Our 
      initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for 
      eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review 
      with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following 
      eHealth methods-Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The 
      associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), 
      Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home 
      health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual 
      health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and 
      signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. 
      Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and 
      remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings 
      were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., 
      ontology model). CONCLUSIONS: Various e-Health methods, related remote monitoring 
      technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT 
      tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and 
      limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of 
      e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and 
      possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve 
      definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded 
      in contexts. Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT 
      and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social 
      informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information 
      crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible 
      information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 
      patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques.

TI  - Evaluation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in luminal breast cancer using 
      artificial intelligence.
PG  - 1747-1758
LID - 10.1038/s41416-023-02451-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a prognostic parameter in 
      triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive 
      breast cancer (BC). However, their role in luminal (oestrogen receptor positive 
      and HER2 negative (ER + /HER2-)) BC remains unclear. In this study, we used 
      artificial intelligence (AI) to assess the prognostic significance of TILs in a 
      large well-characterised cohort of luminal BC. METHODS: Supervised deep learning 
      model analysis of Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSI) 
      was applied to a cohort of 2231 luminal early-stage BC patients with long-term 
      follow-up. Stromal TILs (sTILs) and intratumoural TILs (tTILs) were quantified 
      and their spatial distribution within tumour tissue, as well as the proportion of 
      stroma involved by sTILs were assessed. The association of TILs with 
      clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome was determined. RESULTS: A 
      strong positive linear correlation was observed between sTILs and tTILs. High 
      sTILs and tTILs counts, as well as their proximity to stromal and tumour cells 
      (co-occurrence) were associated with poor clinical outcomes and unfavourable 
      clinicopathological parameters including high tumour grade, lymph node 
      metastasis, large tumour size, and young age. AI-based assessment of the 
      proportion of stroma composed of sTILs (as assessed visually in routine practice) 
      was not predictive of patient outcome. tTILs was an independent predictor of 
      worse patient outcome in multivariate Cox Regression analysis. CONCLUSION: 
      AI-based detection of TILs counts, and their spatial distribution provides 
      prognostic value in luminal early-stage BC patients. The utilisation of AI 
      algorithms could provide a comprehensive assessment of TILs as a morphological 
      variable in WSIs beyond eyeballing assessment.

AB  - The UK NHS Women's National Breast Screening programme aims to detect breast 
      cancer early. The reference standard approach requires mammograms to be 
      independently double-read by qualified radiology staff. If two readers disagree, 
      arbitration by an independent reader is undertaken. Whilst this process maximises 
      accuracy and minimises recall rates, the procedure is labour-intensive, adding 
      pressure to a system currently facing a workforce crisis. Artificial intelligence 
      technology offers an alternative to human readers. While artificial intelligence 
      has been shown to be non-inferior versus human second readers, the minimum 
      requirements needed (effectiveness, set-up costs, maintenance, etc) for such 
      technology to be cost-effective in the NHS have not been evaluated. We developed 
      a simulation model replicating NHS screening services to evaluate the potential 
      value of the technology. Our results indicate that if non-inferiority is 
      maintained, the use of artificial intelligence technology as a second reader is a 
      viable and potentially cost-effective use of NHS resources.

TI  - Protective factors of suicidal behaviors in children and adolescents/young 
      adults: A literature review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicidal behaviors present a public health challenge in children and 
      adolescents. Although the risk factors have long been well documented, protective 
      factors have only been documented for a few years, and there has not been a 
      literature review concerning the suicidal behaviors of children and adolescents 
      since 2006. METHODS: Relevant articles were collected using the Medline/PubMed, 
      Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Studies meeting the following 
      inclusion criteria were included: age of participants from 6 to 19 years, 
      qualitative and quantitative cohort or case-control studies, multivariate 
      analysis studies, and studies with significant results for at least one 
      protective factor. The methodology used in this review is based on the PRISMA 
      criteria. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in this review, which 
      highlights various individual and environmental protective factors. The results 
      were too heterogeneous to perform a meta-analysis, and therefore the discussion 
      is in the form of a narrative summary. High-quality relationships with family and 
      in the school environment were the most frequently found protective factors. The 
      presence of positive links with peers, with other adults, and with the culture of 
      origin was also noted. On an individual level, self-esteem, emotional 
      intelligence, and particular coping abilities were found to be the most important 
      protective factors. CONCLUSION: There are numerous important protective factors 
      for suicidal behaviors in children and adolescents and also for adapting care to 
      their needs. A future challenge will be to determine the best protective factors 
      to be consolidated or strengthened using self-assessment tools that are already 
      in use or being developed.

TI  - The effect of poor glycemic control on cognitive function in children and 
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus: A single-center cross-sectional study 
      (2019-2020).
PG  - 1006-1012
LID - 10.15537/smj.2023.44.20230327 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of chronic hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and 
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) on the cognitive function of children and adolescents 
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and explore whether early disease onset 
      correlated with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Children and adolescents with T1DM 
      who attended the Pediatric Diabetes Clinic between January 2019 and 2020, aged 
      between 5-14 years, with a mean of 3 glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) readings ≥7% (53 
      mmol/mol) during the study period reflecting a hyperglycemic status and who 
      agreed to participate were interviewed about their history of hypoglycemia and 
      DKA. Participants were personally interviewed by a clinical psychologist to 
      assess their cognitive function using a validated Arabic version of the 
      Stanford-Binet test. RESULTS: Higher mean HbA1c levels were associated with 
      cognitive dysfunction in three verbal domains: fluid reasoning, quantitative 
      reasoning, and working memory. Frequent hypoglycemia negatively affected verbal 
      knowledge. In contrast, significant hypoglycemia affected both verbal and 
      nonverbal domains of cognition, specifically verbal and nonverbal fluid 
      reasoning, knowledge, and working memory. Children with recurrent DKA performed 
      below average in nonverbal fluid reasoning tasks. Additionally, moderate or 
      severe DKA, regardless of its frequency, affected children's overall intelligence 
      quotient. CONCLUSION: Regardless of disease onset, exposure to glycemic 
      variability subjects children and adolescents to subtle and measurable cognitive 
      dysfunction resulting in significant morbidity.
