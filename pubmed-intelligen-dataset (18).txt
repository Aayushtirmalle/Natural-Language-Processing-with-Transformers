AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive function can decline in adults with moyamoya disease (MMD). 
      Memory, which is an essential but complex and multifaceted function, underpins 
      executive and intellectual functions. However, the relationship between memory 
      and executive or intellectual functions in adults with MMD has not been well 
      studied. The relationship between memory and cerebral blood flow has also not 
      been elucidated. This study investigated correlations between memory, executive 
      function, and intellectual function, and associations between cerebral blood flow 
      and memory in adults with MMD. METHODS: Memory, executive function, and 
      intellectual function were assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised 
      (WMS-R), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 
      (WAIS) third or fourth edition, respectively, in 31 adults with MMD. Cerebral 
      blood flow was measured with iodine (123)I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission 
      computed tomography. RESULTS: WMS-R scores correlated significantly with total 
      FAB and WAIS scores before and after revascularization. Cerebral blood flow in 
      the left posterior cerebral artery territory correlated positively with WMS-R and 
      WAIS scores pre- and postoperatively. Postoperative cerebrovascular reserves of 
      the right cerebellum, pons, and vermis were positively associated with visual 
      memory, and postoperative cerebrovascular reserve of the pons was also associated 
      with general memory. CONCLUSIONS: Memory function correlates with executive and 
      intellectual functions in adults with MMD. The FAB, which requires about 10 min 
      to administer, might be useful to screen for memory dysfunction. Memory might be 
      vulnerable to hypoperfusion in the posterior cerebral artery territory among 
      adults with MMD. Postoperative cerebrovascular reserve might help predict memory 
      dysfunction in adults with MMD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This scoping review aimed to offer researchers and practitioners an 
      understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in physical activity 
      (PA) interventions; introduce them to prevalent machine learning (ML), deep 
      learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms; and encourage the 
      adoption of AI methodologies. METHODS: A scoping review was performed in PubMed, 
      Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO focusing on AI applications for 
      promoting PA or predicting related behavioral or health outcomes. AI 
      methodologies were summarized and categorized to identify synergies, patterns, 
      and trends informing future research. Additionally, a concise primer on 
      predominant AI methodologies within the realm of PA was provided to bolster 
      understanding and broader application. RESULTS: The review included 24 studies 
      that met the predetermined eligibility criteria. AI models were found effective 
      in detecting significant patterns of PA behavior and associations between 
      specific factors and intervention outcomes. Most studies comparing AI models to 
      traditional statistical approaches reported higher prediction accuracy for AI 
      models on test data. Comparisons of different AI models yielded mixed results, 
      likely due to model performance being highly dependent on the dataset and task. 
      An increasing trend of adopting state-of-the-art DL and RL models over standard 
      ML was observed, addressing complex human-machine communication, behavior 
      modification, and decision-making tasks. Six key areas for future AI adoption in 
      PA interventions emerged: personalized PA interventions, real-time monitoring and 
      adaptation, integration of multimodal data sources, evaluation of intervention 
      effectiveness, expanding access to PA interventions, and predicting and 
      preventing injuries. CONCLUSION: The scoping review highlights the potential of 
      AI methodologies for advancing PA interventions. As the field progresses, staying 
      informed and exploring emerging AI-driven strategies is essential for achieving 
      significant improvements in PA interventions and fostering overall well-being.

TI  - Efficient improvement of the proliferation, differentiation, and anti-arthritic 
      capacity of mesenchymal stem cells by simply culturing on the immobilized FGF2 
      derived peptide, 44-ERGVVSIKGV-53.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The stem cell microenvironment has been evidenced to robustly 
      affect its biological functions and clinical grade. Natural or synthetic growth 
      factors, especially, are essential for modulating stem cell proliferation, 
      metabolism, and differentiation via the interaction with specific extracellular 
      receptors. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) possesses pleiotropic functions in 
      various tissues and organs. It interacts with the FGF receptor (FGFR) and 
      activates FGFR signaling pathways, which involve numerous biological functions, 
      such as angiogenesis, wound healing, cell proliferation, and differentiation. 
      OBJECTIVES: Here, we aim to explore the molecular functions, mode of action, and 
      therapeutic activity of yet undetermined function, FGF-2-derived peptide, FP2 
      (44-ERGVVSIKGV-53) in promoting the proliferation, differentiation, and 
      therapeutic application of human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells 
      (hWJ-MSCs) in comparison to other test peptides, canofin1 (FP1), hexafin2 (FP3), 
      and canofin3 (FP4) with known functions. METHODS: The immobilization of test 
      peptides that are fused with mussel adhesive proteins (MAP) on the culture plate 
      was carried out via EDC/NHS chemistry. Cell Proliferation assay, colony-forming 
      unit, western blotting analysis, gene expression analysis, RNA-Seq. analysis, 
      osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation capacity were applied to test the 
      activity of the test peptides. We additionally utilized three-dimensional (3D) 
      structural analysis and artificial intelligence (AI)-based AlphaFold2 and 
      CABS-dock programs for receptor interaction prediction of the peptide receptor. 
      We also verified the in vivo therapeutic capacity of FP2-cultured hWJ-MSCs using 
      an osteoarthritis mice model. RESULTS: Culture of hWJ-MSC onto an FP2-immobilized 
      culture plate showed a significant increase in cell proliferation (n = 3; 
      *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) and the colony-forming unit (n = 3; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) 
      compared with the test peptides. FP2 showed a significantly upregulated 
      phosphorylation of FRS2α and FGFR1 and activated the AKT and ERK signaling 
      pathways (n = 3; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Interestingly, we detected 
      efficient FP2 receptor binding that was predicted using AI-based tools. Treatment 
      with an AKT inhibitor significantly abrogated the FP2-mediated enhancement of 
      cell differentiation (n = 3; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). 
      Intra-articular injection of FP2-cultured MSCs significantly mitigated arthritis 
      symptoms in an osteoarthritis mouse model, as shown through the functional tests 
      (n = 10; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001), modulation of the 
      expression level of the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes, and 
      improved osteochondral regeneration as demonstrated by tissue sections. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study identified the FGF-2-derived peptide FP2 as a promising 
      candidate peptide to improve the therapeutic potential of hWJ-MSCs, especially in 
      bone and cartilage regeneration.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) meridian is 
      the key theoretical guidance of prescription against tumor in clinical practice. 
      However, there is no scientific and systematic verification of therapeutic action 
      of herbs under meridians context. Several studies have determined the Chinese 
      herbal medicine (CHM) phytochemicals for intrinsic attribute or meridians 
      classification based on artificial intelligence (AI) tools. However, it is 
      challenging to represent the complex molecular structures with large 
      heterogeneity through the current technologies. In addition, the multiple 
      correspondence between herbs and meridians has not been paid much attention. AIM 
      OF THE STUDY: We aim to develop an AI framework to classify multi-target 
      meridians through the topological structure of phytochemicals. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 354 anti-cancer herbs, their corresponding TCM meridians and 
      5471 ingredient compounds were collected from public databases of CancerHSP, 
      ETCM, and Hit 2.0. The statistical analysis of herbal and compound datasets, 
      clustering analysis of the associated cancers, and correlational analysis of 
      meridian tropism were preliminary conducted. Then a deep learning (DL) hybrid 
      model named GRMC consisting of graph convolutional network (GCN) and recurrent 
      neural network (RNN) was employed to generate the meridian multi-label sequences 
      based on molecular graph. RESULTS: The curing herbs against tumors have tight 
      relationships to lung, liver, stomach, and spleen meridians. These herbs behave 
      different properties in curing certain cancer. Certain cancer types have 
      co-occurrence such as ovarian, bladder and cervical cancer. Compounds have 
      multitarget meridians with characteristics of higher-order correlations. Compared 
      with the other state-of-the-art algorithms on the datasets and previous methods 
      dealing with conventional fixed fingerprints of herbal compounds, the proposed 
      GRMC has superior overall performance on testing dataset with the one error of 
      0.183, hamming loss of 0.112, mean averaged accuracy (MAA) of 0.855, mean 
      averaged precision (MAP) of 0.891, mean averaged recall (MAR) of 0.812, and mean 
      averaged F1 score (MAF) of 0.849. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method can predict 
      multi-targeted meridians through neural graph features in herbal compounds and 
      outperforms several comparison methods. It could provide a basis for 
      understanding the molecular scientific evidence of TCM meridians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is soaring, and the launch of 
      ChatGPT in November 2022 has accelerated this trend. This "chatbot" can generate 
      complete scientific articles, with risk of plagiarism by mining existing data or 
      downright fraud by fabricating studies with no real data at all. There are tools 
      that detect AI in publications, but to our knowledge they have not been 
      systematically assessed for publication in scientific journals. We therefore 
      conducted a retrospective study on articles published in Orthopaedics & 
      Traumatology: Surgery & Research (OTSR): firstly, to screen for AI-generated 
      content before and after the publicized launch of ChatGPT; secondly, to assess 
      whether AI was more often used in some countries than others to generate content; 
      thirdly, to determine whether plagiarism rate correlated with AI-generation, and 
      lastly, to determine whether elements other than text generation, and notably the 
      translation procedure, could raise suspicion of AI use. HYPOTHESIS: The rate of 
      AI use increased after the publicized launch of ChatGPT v3.5 in November 2022. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: In all, 425 articles published between February 2022 and 
      September 2023 (221 before and 204 after November 1, 2022) underwent ZeroGPT 
      assessment of the level of AI generation in the final English-language version 
      (abstract and body of the article). Two scores were obtained: probability of AI 
      generation, in six grades from Human to AI; and percentage AI generation. 
      Plagiarism was assessed on the Ithenticate application at submission. Articles in 
      French were assessed in their English-language version as translated by a human 
      translator, with comparison to automatic translation by Google Translate and 
      DeepL. RESULTS: AI-generated text was detected mainly in Abstracts, with a 10.1% 
      rate of AI or considerable AI generation, compared to only 1.9% for the body of 
      the article and 5.6% for the total body+abstract. Analysis for before and after 
      November 2022 found an increase in AI generation in body+abstract, from 
      10.30±15.95% (range, 0-100%) to 15.64±19.8% (range, 0-99.93) (p < 0.04; NS for 
      abstracts alone). AI scores differed between types of article: 14.9% for original 
      articles and 9.8% for reviews (p<0.01). The highest rates of probable AI 
      generation were in articles from Japan, China, South America and English-speaking 
      countries (p<0.0001). Plagiarism rates did not increase between the two study 
      periods, and were unrelated to AI rates. On the other hand, when articles were 
      classified as "suspected" of AI generation (plagiarism rate ≥ 20%) or 
      "non-suspected" (rate<20%), the "similarity" score was higher in suspect 
      articles: 25.7±13.23% (range, 10-69%) versus 16.28±10% (range, 0-79%) 
      (p < 0.001). In the body of the article, use of translation software was 
      associated with higher AI rates than with a human translator: 3.5±5% for human 
      translators, versus 18±10% and 21.9±11% respectively for Google Translate and 
      DeepL (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The present study revealed an increasing rate of 
      AI use in articles published in OTSR. AI grades differed according to type of 
      article and country of origin. Use of translation software increased the AI 
      grade. In the long run, use of ChatGPT incurs a risk of plagiarism and scientific 
      misconduct, and needs to be detected and signaled by a digital tag on any 
      robot-generated text. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III; case-control study.

AB  - Organisms control their visual worlds by moving their eyes, heads, and bodies. 
      This control of "gaze" or "looking" is key to survival and intelligence, but our 
      investigation of the underlying neural mechanisms in natural conditions is 
      hindered by technical limitations. Recent advances have enabled measurement of 
      both brain and behavior in freely moving animals in complex environments, 
      expanding on historical head-fixed laboratory investigations. We juxtapose 
      looking behavior as traditionally measured in the laboratory against looking 
      behavior in naturalistic conditions, finding that behavior changes when animals 
      are free to move or when stimuli have depth or sound. We specifically focus on 
      the brainstem circuits driving gaze shifts and gaze stabilization. The 
      overarching goal of this review is to reconcile historical understanding of the 
      differential neural circuits for different "classes" of gaze shift with two 
      inconvenient truths. (1) "classes" of gaze behavior are artificial. (2) The 
      neural circuits historically identified to control each "class" of behavior do 
      not operate in isolation during natural behavior. Instead, multiple pathways 
      combine adaptively and non-linearly depending on individual experience. While the 
      neural circuits for reflexive and voluntary gaze behaviors traverse somewhat 
      independent brainstem and spinal cord circuits, both can be modulated by 
      feedback, meaning that most gaze behaviors are learned rather than hardcoded. 
      Despite this flexibility, there are broadly enumerable neural pathways commonly 
      adopted among primate gaze systems. Parallel pathways which carry simultaneous 
      evolutionary and homeostatic drives converge in superior colliculus, a layered 
      midbrain structure which integrates and relays these volitional signals to 
      brainstem gaze-control circuits.

AB  - Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in drug design represents an advanced 
      approach for identifying targets and developing new drugs. Integrating AI 
      techniques significantly reduces the workload involved in drug development and 
      enhances the efficiency of early-stage drug discovery. This review aims to 
      present a comprehensive overview of the utilization of AI methods in the field of 
      small drug design, with a specific focus on four key areas: protein structure 
      prediction, molecular virtual screening, molecular design, and absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction. 
      Additionally, the role and limitations of AI in drug development are explored, 
      and the impact of AI on decision-making processes is studied. It is important to 
      note that while AI can bring numerous benefits to the early stage of drug 
      development, the direction and quality of decision-making should still be 
      emphasized, as AI should be considered as a tool rather than a decisive factor.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: ChatGPT has gained significant popularity as a source of healthcare 
      information among the general population. Evaluating the quality of chatbot 
      responses is crucial, requiring comprehensive and qualitative analysis. This 
      study aims to assess the answers provided by ChatGPT during hypothetical breast 
      augmentation consultations across various categories and depths. The evaluation 
      involves the utilization of validated tools and a comparison of scores between 
      plastic surgeons and laypersons. METHODS: A panel consisting of five plastic 
      surgeons and five laypersons evaluated ChatGPT's responses to 25 questions 
      spanning consultation, procedure, recovery, and sentiment categories. The DISCERN 
      and PEMAT tools were employed to assess the responses, while emotional context 
      was examined through ten specific questions. Additionally, readability was 
      measured using the Flesch Reading Ease score. Qualitative analysis was performed 
      to identify the overall strengths and weaknesses. RESULTS: Plastic surgeons 
      generally scored lower than laypersons across most domains. Scores for each 
      evaluation domain varied by category, with the consultation category 
      demonstrating lower scores in terms of DISCERN reliability, information quality, 
      and DISCERN score. Plastic surgeons assigned significantly lower overall quality 
      ratings to the procedure category compared to other question categories. They 
      also gave lower emotion scores in the procedure category compared to laypersons. 
      The depth of the questions did not impact the scoring. CONCLUSIONS: Existing 
      health information evaluation tools may not be entirely suitable for 
      comprehensively evaluating the quality of individual responses generated by 
      ChatGPT. Consequently, the development and implementation of appropriate 
      evaluation tools to assess the appropriateness and quality of AI consultations 
      are necessary.

TI  - Evaluating ChatGPT responses in the context of a 53-year-old male with a femoral 
      neck fracture: a qualitative analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00590-023-03742-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, 
      in clinical medicine and medical education has gained significant attention due 
      to their potential to support decision-making and improve patient care. However, 
      there is a need to evaluate the benefits and limitations of these tools in 
      specific clinical scenarios. METHODS: This study used a case study approach 
      within the field of orthopaedic surgery. A clinical case report featuring a 
      53-year-old male with a femoral neck fracture was used as the basis for 
      evaluation. ChatGPT, a large language model, was asked to respond to clinical 
      questions related to the case. The responses generated by ChatGPT were evaluated 
      qualitatively, considering their relevance, justification, and alignment with the 
      responses of real clinicians. Alternative dialogue protocols were also employed 
      to assess the impact of additional prompts and contextual information on ChatGPT 
      responses. RESULTS: ChatGPT generally provided clinically appropriate responses 
      to the questions posed in the clinical case report. However, the level of 
      justification and explanation varied across the generated responses. 
      Occasionally, clinically inappropriate responses and inconsistencies were 
      observed in the generated responses across different dialogue protocols and on 
      separate days. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study highlight both the 
      potential and limitations of using ChatGPT in clinical practice. While ChatGPT 
      demonstrated the ability to provide relevant clinical information, the lack of 
      consistent justification and occasional clinically inappropriate responses raise 
      concerns about its reliability. These results underscore the importance of 
      careful consideration and validation when using AI tools in healthcare. Further 
      research and clinician training are necessary to effectively integrate AI tools 
      like ChatGPT, ensuring their safe and reliable use in clinical decision-making.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome on ultrasound using 
      artificial intelligence: How does performance compare to a current screening 
      programme?
LID - 10.1002/pd.6445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve prenatal 
      detection of congenital heart disease. We analysed the performance of the current 
      national screening programme in detecting hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) 
      to compare with our own AI model. METHODS: Current screening programme 
      performance was calculated from local and national sources. AI models were 
      trained using four-chamber ultrasound views of the fetal heart, using a ResNet 
      classifier. RESULTS: Estimated current fetal screening programme sensitivity and 
      specificity for HLHS were 94.3% and 99.985%, respectively. Depending on 
      calibration, AI models to detect HLHS were either highly sensitive (sensitivity 
      100%, specificity 94.0%) or highly specific (sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 
      100%). Our analysis suggests that our highly sensitive model would generate 
      45,134 screen positive results for a gain of 14 additional HLHS cases. Our highly 
      specific model would be associated with two fewer detected HLHS cases, and 118 
      fewer false positives. CONCLUSION: If used independently, our AI model 
      performance is slightly worse than the performance level of the current screening 
      programme in detecting HLHS, and this performance is likely to deteriorate 
      further when used prospectively. This demonstrates that collaboration between 
      humans and AI will be key for effective future clinical use.
