"what safety measures were used in the development of llama 2?";"Safety measures used in the development of Llama 2 included safety-specific data annotation and tuning, conducting red-teaming, and employing iterative evaluations. These measures were implemented to increase the safety of the models and ensure responsible development of large language models (LLMs)."
"What is LLaMA 2 and how does it differ from its predecessor, LLaMA 1?";"LLaMA 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These fine-tuned LLMs, known as Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. In comparison to its predecessor LLaMA 1, Llama 2 models generally perform better than existing open-source models and are on par with some closed-source models based on human evaluations for helpfulness and safety."
