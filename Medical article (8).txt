AB  - BACKGROUND: Empathy is an essential quality for physicians and medical trainees. 
      This study aimed to examine the associations of emotional intelligence (EI) and 
      gratitude with empathy in medical students. METHODS: We conducted this 
      cross-sectional study at three medical schools in China. A pack of self-reported 
      questionnaires, consisting of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), the Trait 
      Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF), the Gratitude 
      Questionnaire-6 (GQ-6), and demographic section were distributed to the students. 
      RESULTS: A pool of 1392 students became the final participants. After adjustment 
      for the demographics, trait EI and gratitude were positively related to 
      Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern, accounting for 33.1 and 22.7% of their 
      variance, respectively. While trait EI was strongly and negatively associated 
      with Personal Distress, gratitude was modestly and positively associated with it, 
      and they collectively explained 29.1% of its variance. CONCLUSIONS: Trait EI and 
      gratitude could be vital psychological constructs for understanding empathy in 
      medical students. The positive roles they may play could be considered when 
      intervention strategies and programs are designed to enhance the professional 
      competencies in medical students.

TI  - Temporal stability of functional brain modules associated with human 
      intelligence.
PG  - 362-372
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24807 [doi]
AB  - Individual differences in general cognitive ability (i.e., intelligence) have 
      been linked to individual variations in the modular organization of functional 
      brain networks. However, these analyses have been limited to static 
      (time-averaged) connectivity, and have not yet addressed whether dynamic changes 
      in the configuration of brain networks relate to general intelligence. Here, we 
      used multiband functional MRI resting-state data (N = 281) and estimated 
      subject-specific time-varying functional connectivity networks. Modularity 
      optimization was applied to determine individual time-variant module partitions 
      and to assess fluctuations in modularity across time. We show that higher 
      intelligence, indexed by an established composite measure, the Wechsler 
      Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), is associated with higher temporal 
      stability (lower temporal variability) of brain network modularity. Post-hoc 
      analyses reveal that subjects with higher intelligence scores engage in fewer 
      periods of extremely high modularity - which are characterized by greater 
      disconnection of task-positive from task-negative networks. Further, we show that 
      brain regions of the dorsal attention network contribute most to the observed 
      effect. In sum, our study suggests that investigating the temporal dynamics of 
      functional brain network topology contributes to our understanding of the neural 
      bases of general cognitive abilities.

TI  - Application of information-intelligence technologies in pharmacy intravenous 
      admixture services in a Chinese third-class a hospital.
PG  - 1238

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacy intravenous admixture service (PIVAS) center has emerged as 
      an important department of hospital as it can improve occupational protection and 
      ensure the safety and effectiveness of intravenous infusions. However, medication 
      errors were considered to be a significant challenge in PIVAS, so 
      information-intelligence technologies were introduced to optimize the management 
      of PIVAS. Our article summarized the application of information-intelligence 
      technologies in PIVAS of a large third-class A hospital in China, and provided an 
      example for PIVAS in other hospitals at home and abroad. METHODS: 
      Prescription-reviewing rules containing intravenous medications and infusion 
      solution guideline were recorded in the database of prescription-cheking system. 
      Drugs information were recorded in the PIVAS management system with special 
      identification and warning labels to reduce intravenous infusion errors. 
      Automatic labeling device was used to label the infusion bags, and the quality 
      control program database of intelligent compounding robot for cytotoxic drugs was 
      established ingeniously. Automatic sorting devices were applied for the third 
      batch of finished infusion admixtures, and intelligent logistics robots were used 
      to transport the infusion to the ward. RESULTS: After establishing and 
      implementing of prescription-reviewing rules in the prescription-cheking system 
      database, the number of prescriptions checked by pharmacists increased from 18 to 
      43 per minute. The success rate of intervention with irrational medical orders 
      increased from 85.89% to 99.06% (P < 0.05). By introducing various intelligent 
      devices, automatic labeling significantly enhanced work efficiency and reduced 
      the error rate (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the use of intelligent intravenous 
      compounding robots significantly reduced the risk of errors (P < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The application of information-intelligence technologies in PIVAS 
      can improve work efficiency and reduce error risk. However, some intelligent 
      devices have failed to achieve the expected effect in practical use, and further 
      improvements are needed to meet the demands of PIVAS in the future.

LID - 8391
AB  - The testing and evaluation system has been the key technology and security with 
      its necessity in the development and deployment of maturing automated vehicles. 
      In this research, the physics-intelligence hybrid theory-based dynamic scenario 
      library generation method is proposed to improve system performance, in 
      particular, the testing efficiency and accuracy for automated vehicles. A general 
      framework of the dynamic scenario library generation is established. Then, the 
      parameterized scenario based on the dimension optimization method is specified to 
      obtain the effective scenario element set. Long-tail functions for performance 
      testing of specific ODD are constructed as optimization boundaries and critical 
      scenario searching methods are proposed based on the node optimization and sample 
      expansion methods for the low-dimensional scenario library generation and the 
      reinforcement learning for the high-dimensional one, respectively. The scenario 
      library generation method is evaluated with the naturalistic driving data (NDD) 
      of the intelligent electric vehicle in the field test. Results show better 
      efficient and accuracy performances compared with the ideal testing library and 
      the NDD, respectively, in both low- and high-dimensional scenarios.

AB  - An environment of physically linked, technologically networked things that can be 
      found online is known as the "Internet of Things." With the use of various 
      devices connected to a network that allows data transfer between these devices, 
      this includes the creation of intelligent communications and computational 
      environments, such as intelligent homes, smart transportation systems, and 
      intelligent FinTech. A variety of learning and optimization methods form the 
      foundation of computational intelligence. Therefore, including new learning 
      techniques such as opposition-based learning, optimization strategies, and 
      reinforcement learning is the key growing trend for the next generation of IoT 
      applications. In this study, a collaborative control system based on multiagent 
      reinforcement learning with intelligent sensors for variable-guidance sections at 
      various junctions is proposed. In the future generation of Internet of Things 
      (IoT) applications, this study provides a multi-intersection variable steering 
      lane-appropriate control approach that uses intelligent sensors to reduce traffic 
      congestion at many junctions. Since the multi-intersection scene's complicated 
      traffic flow cannot be accommodated by the conventional variable steering lane 
      management approach. The priority experience replay algorithm is also included to 
      improve the efficiency of the transition sequence's use in the experience replay 
      pool and speed up the algorithm's convergence for effective quality of service in 
      the upcoming IoT applications. The experimental investigation demonstrates that 
      the multi-intersection variable steering lane with intelligent sensors is an 
      appropriate control mechanism, successfully reducing queue length and delay time. 
      The effectiveness of waiting times and other indicators is superior to that of 
      other control methods, which efficiently coordinate the strategy switching of 
      variable steerable lanes and enhance the traffic capacity of the road network 
      under multiple intersections for effective quality of service in the upcoming IoT 
      applications.

AB  - Aiming at the limitations of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) with 
      rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), in order to improve the 
      accuracy of diagnosis, an intelligent-aided diagnosis method based on few-channel 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and time-frequency deep network is proposed for PD 
      with RBD. Firstly, in order to improve the speed of the operation and robustness 
      of the algorithm, the 6-channel scalp EEG of each subject were segmented with the 
      same time-window. Secondly, the model of time-frequency deep network was 
      constructed and trained with time-window EEG data to obtain the 
      segmentation-based classification result. Finally, the output of time-frequency 
      deep network was postprocessed to obtain the subject-based diagnosis result. 
      Polysomnography (PSG) of 60 patients, including 30 idiopathic PD and 30 PD with 
      RBD, were collected by Nanjing Brain Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical 
      University and the doctor's detection results of PSG were taken as the gold 
      standard in our study. The accuracy of the segmentation-based classification was 
      0.902 4 in the validation set. The accuracy of the subject-based classification 
      was 0.933 3 in the test set. Compared with the RBD screening questionnaire 
      (RBDSQ), the novel approach has clinical application value.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the relation and the moderating effect of the 
      organizational factors on the attitudes towards communication, empathy, and 
      emotional intelligence in the nurses. METHOD: a cross-sectional study was 
      conducted with a convenience sample of 268 nurses from Valencia, Spain. The 
      attitudes towards communication were evaluated by means of the specifically 
      designed instrument, those towards empathy with the Jefferson's Scale of Empathy 
      for Nursing Students, and those towards emotional intelligence by means of the 
      Trait Meta-Mood Scale, consisting of 24 items. The effect of the studied 
      variables was assessed by means of ANOVA, multiple linear regression models were 
      applied, and the moderating effect was analyzed using PROCESS. RESULTS: there are 
      statistically significant differences based on the type on contract (permanent); 
      and statistically significant differences were found in the cognitive dimension 
      of the attitudes towards communication. Regarding the regression models, the 
      perspective taking dimension of empathy was the main predictive variable tn the 
      dimensions of the attitudes towards communication. Finally, a moderating effect 
      of the type of contract was evidenced in the effect of emotional reparation over 
      the cognitive dimension of the attitudes towards communication. CONCLUSION: the 
      organizational factors exert an influence on the attitudes towards communication, 
      empathy, and emotional intelligence.

AB  - Human emotions affect psychological health to a great level. Positive emotions 
      relate to health improvement; whereas negative emotions may aggravate 
      psychological disorders such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Although there 
      exist several computational methods to predict psychological disorders, most of 
      them provide a black-box view of uncertainty. This research involves developing a 
      novel predictive model for multi class psychological risk recognition with an 
      accurate explainable interface. Standard questionnaires are utilized as data set 
      and a new approach called a Q-Prioritization is employed to drop insignificant 
      questions from the data set. Moreover, a novel balanced decision tree method 
      based on repetitive oversampling is applied for the training and testing of the 
      model. Predictive nature along with its contributing factors are interpreted with 
      three techniques such as permuted feature importance, contrastive explanation, 
      and counterfactual method, which together form a reasoning engine. The prediction 
      outcome generated an impressive performance with an aggregated accuracy of 
      98.25%. The mean precision, recall, and F-score metric recorded were 0.98, 0.977, 
      and 0.979, respectively. Also, it was noted that without applying 
      Q-Prioritization, the accuracy significantly drops to 90.25%. The error rate 
      observed with our model was only 0.026. The proposed multi-level psychological 
      disorder predictive model can successfully serve as an assistive deployment for 
      medical experts in the effective treatment of mental health.

      Quotient and Sub-domain Scores.
PG  - 888-900
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhz134 [doi]
AB  - Scores on intelligence tests are strongly predictive of various important life 
      outcomes. However, the gender discrepancy on intelligence quotient (IQ) 
      prediction using brain imaging variables has not been studied. To this aim, we 
      predicted individual IQ scores for males and females separately using whole-brain 
      functional connectivity (FC). Robust predictions of intellectual capabilities 
      were achieved across three independent data sets (680 subjects) and two 
      intelligence measurements (IQ and fluid intelligence) using the same model within 
      each gender. Interestingly, we found that intelligence of males and females were 
      underpinned by different neurobiological correlates, which are consistent with 
      their respective superiority in cognitive domains (visuospatial vs verbal 
      ability). In addition, the identified FC patterns are uniquely predictive on IQ 
      and its sub-domain scores only within the same gender but neither for the 
      opposite gender nor on the IQ-irrelevant measures such as temperament traits. 
      Moreover, females exhibit significantly higher IQ predictability than males in 
      the discovery cohort. This findings facilitate our understanding of the 
      biological basis of intelligence by demonstrating that intelligence is 
      underpinned by a variety of complex neural mechanisms that engage an interacting 
      network of regions-particularly prefrontal-parietal and basal ganglia-whereas the 
      network pattern differs between genders.

      also no longer simply recording the data, they process it and transform into 
      something useful before uploading to the cloud. However, building sensor networks 
      is costly and very time consuming. It is difficult to build upon other people's 
      work and there are only a few open-source solutions for integrating different 
      devices and sensing modalities. We introduce REIP, a Reconfigurable Environmental 
      Intelligence Platform for fast sensor network prototyping. REIP's first and most 
      central tool, implemented in this work, is an open-source software framework, an 
      SDK, with a flexible modular API for data collection and analysis using multiple 
      sensing modalities. REIP is developed with the aim of being user-friendly, 
      device-agnostic, and easily extensible, allowing for fast prototyping of 
      heterogeneous sensor networks. Furthermore, our software framework is implemented 
      in Python to reduce the entrance barrier for future contributions. We demonstrate 
      the potential and versatility of REIP in real world applications, along with 
      performance studies and benchmark REIP SDK against similar systems.
