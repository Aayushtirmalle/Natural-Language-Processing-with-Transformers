AB  - Integrating neural cultures developed through synthetic biology methods with 
      digital computing has enabled the early development of Synthetic Biological 
      Intelligence (SBI). Recently, key studies have emphasized the advantages of 
      biological neural systems in some information processing tasks. However, neither 
      the technology behind this early development, nor the potential ethical 
      opportunities or challenges, have been explored in detail yet. Here, we review 
      the key aspects that facilitate the development of SBI and explore potential 
      applications. Considering these foreseeable use cases, various ethical 
      implications are proposed. Ultimately, this work aims to provide a robust 
      framework to structure ethical considerations to ensure that SBI technology can 
      be both researched and applied responsibly.

TI  - Intelligent Insulin vs. Artificial Intelligence for Type 1 Diabetes: Will the 
      Real Winner Please Stand Up?
LID - 10.3390/ijms241713139 [doi]
LID - 13139
AB  - Research in the treatment of type 1 diabetes has been addressed into two main 
      areas: the development of "intelligent insulins" capable of auto-regulating their 
      own levels according to glucose concentrations, or the exploitation of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and its learning capacity, to provide decision support systems 
      to improve automated insulin therapy. This review aims to provide a synthetic 
      overview of the current state of these two research areas, providing an outline 
      of the latest development in the search for "intelligent insulins," and the 
      results of new and promising advances in the use of artificial intelligence to 
      regulate automated insulin infusion and glucose control. The future of insulin 
      treatment in type 1 diabetes appears promising with AI, with research nearly 
      reaching the possibility of finally having a "closed-loop" artificial pancreas.

TI  - Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience towards the Diagnosis of 
      Neurological Disorders-A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/s23063062 [doi]
LID - 3062
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that deals with the 
      simulation of human intelligence using machines so that such machines gain 
      problem-solving and decision-making capabilities similar to that of the human 
      brain. Neuroscience is the scientific study of the struczture and cognitive 
      functions of the brain. Neuroscience and AI are mutually interrelated. These two 
      fields help each other in their advancements. The theory of neuroscience has 
      brought many distinct improvisations into the AI field. The biological neural 
      network has led to the realization of complex deep neural network architectures 
      that are used to develop versatile applications, such as text processing, speech 
      recognition, object detection, etc. Additionally, neuroscience helps to validate 
      the existing AI-based models. Reinforcement learning in humans and animals has 
      inspired computer scientists to develop algorithms for reinforcement learning in 
      artificial systems, which enables those systems to learn complex strategies 
      without explicit instruction. Such learning helps in building complex 
      applications, like robot-based surgery, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, 
      etc. In turn, with its ability to intelligently analyze complex data and extract 
      hidden patterns, AI fits as a perfect choice for analyzing neuroscience data that 
      are very complex. Large-scale AI-based simulations help neuroscientists test 
      their hypotheses. Through an interface with the brain, an AI-based system can 
      extract the brain signals and commands that are generated according to the 
      signals. These commands are fed into devices, such as a robotic arm, which helps 
      in the movement of paralyzed muscles or other human parts. AI has several use 
      cases in analyzing neuroimaging data and reducing the workload of radiologists. 
      The study of neuroscience helps in the early detection and diagnosis of 
      neurological disorders. In the same way, AI can effectively be applied to the 
      prediction and detection of neurological disorders. Thus, in this paper, a 
      scoping review has been carried out on the mutual relationship between AI and 
      neuroscience, emphasizing the convergence between AI and neuroscience in order to 
      detect and predict various neurological disorders.

TI  - General intelligence and executive functioning are overlapping but separable at 
      genetic and molecular pathway levels: An analytical review of existing GWAS 
      findings.
PG  - e0272368

AB  - Understanding the genomic architecture and molecular mechanisms of cognitive 
      functioning in healthy individuals is critical for developing tailored 
      interventions to enhance cognitive functioning, as well as for identifying 
      targets for treating impaired cognition. There has been substantial progress in 
      uncovering the genetic composition of the general cognitive ability (g). However, 
      there is an ongoing debate whether executive functioning (EF)-another key 
      predictor of cognitive health and performance, is separable from general g. To 
      provide an analytical review on existing findings on genetic influences on the 
      relationship between g and EF, we re-analysed a subset of genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS) from the GWAS catalogue that used measures of g and EF as outcomes 
      in non-clinical populations. We identified two sets of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with g (1,372 SNPs across 12 studies), and EF 
      (300 SNPs across 5 studies) at p<5x10-6. A comparative analysis of 
      GWAS-identified g and EF SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), followed by 
      pathway enrichment analyses suggest that g and EF are overlapping but separable 
      at genetic variant and molecular pathway levels, however more evidence is 
      required to characterize the genetic overlap/distinction between the two 
      constructs. While not without limitations, these findings may have implications 
      for navigating further research towards translatable genetic findings for 
      cognitive remediation, enhancement, and augmentation.

AB  - The remarkable anatomical homeostasis exhibited by complex living organisms 
      suggests that they are inherently reprogrammable information-processing systems 
      that offer numerous interfaces to their physiological and anatomical 
      problem-solving capacities. We briefly review data suggesting that the multiscale 
      competency of living forms affords a new path for biomedicine that exploits the 
      innate collective intelligence of tissues and organs. The concept of tissue-level 
      allostatic goal-directedness is already bearing fruit in clinical practice. We 
      sketch a roadmap towards 'somatic psychiatry' by using advances in bioelectricity 
      and behavioral neuroscience to design methods that induce self-repair of 
      structure and function. Relaxing the assumption that cellular control mechanisms 
      are static, exploiting powerful concepts from cybernetics, behavioral science, 
      and developmental biology may spark definitive solutions to current biomedical 
      challenges.

AB  - Quantification of ancient human intelligence has become possible with recent 
      advances in polygenic prediction. Intelligence is a complex trait that has both 
      environmental and genetic components and high heritability. Large-scale 
      genome-wide association studies based on ~270,000 individuals have demonstrated 
      highly significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
      intelligence in present-day humans. We utilized those previously reported 12,037 
      SNPs to estimate a genetic component of intelligence in ancient Funadomari Jomon 
      individual from 3700 years BP as well as four individuals of Afanasievo nuclear 
      family from about 4100 years BP and who are considered anatomically modern 
      humans. We have demonstrated that ancient individuals could have been not 
      inferior in intelligence compared to present-day humans through assessment of the 
      genetic component of intelligence. We have also confirmed that alleles associated 
      with intelligence tend to spread equally between ancestral and derived origin 
      suggesting that intelligence may be a neutral trait in human evolution.
