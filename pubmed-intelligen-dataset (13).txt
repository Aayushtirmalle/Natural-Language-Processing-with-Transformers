      screening technologies in terms of organizational, FAIR and legal principles: 
      scoping review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the increased availability of data sources such as hospital 
      information systems, electronic health records, and health-related registries, a 
      novel approach is required to develop artificial intelligence-based decision 
      support that can assist clinicians in their diagnostic decision-making and 
      shorten rare disease patients' diagnostic odyssey. The aim is to identify key 
      challenges in the process of mapping European rare disease databases, relevant to 
      ML-based screening technologies in terms of organizational, FAIR and legal 
      principles. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on the PRISMA-ScR 
      checklist. The primary article search was conducted in three electronic databases 
      (MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and a secondary search was performed 
      in Google scholar and on the organizations' websites. Each step of this review 
      was carried out independently by two researchers. A charting form for relevant 
      study analysis was developed and used to categorize data and identify data items 
      in three domains - organizational, FAIR and legal. RESULTS: At the end of the 
      screening process, 73 studies were eligible for review based on inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria with more than 60% (n = 46) of the research published in the 
      last 5 years and originated only from EU/EEA countries. Over the ten-year period 
      (2013-2022), there is a clear cycling trend in the publications, with a peak of 
      challenges reporting every four years. Within this trend, the following dynamic 
      was identified: except for 2016, organizational challenges dominated the articles 
      published up to 2018; legal challenges were the most frequently discussed topic 
      from 2018 to 2022. The following distribution of the data items by domains was 
      observed - (1) organizational (n = 36): data accessibility and sharing (20.2%); 
      long-term sustainability (18.2%); governance, planning and design (17.2%); lack 
      of harmonization and standardization (17.2%); quality of data collection (16.2%); 
      and privacy risks and small sample size (11.1%); (2) FAIR (n = 15): findable 
      (17.9%); accessible sustainability (25.0%); interoperable (39.3%); and reusable 
      (17.9%); and (3) legal (n = 33): data protection by all means (34.4%); data 
      management and ownership (22.9%); research under GDPR and member state law 
      (20.8%); trust and transparency (13.5%); and digitalization of health (8.3%). We 
      observed a specific pattern repeated in all domains during the process of data 
      charting and data item identification - in addition to the outlined challenges, 
      good practices, guidelines, and recommendations were also discussed. The 
      proportion of publications addressing only good practices, guidelines, and 
      recommendations for overcoming challenges when mapping RD databases in at least 
      one domain was calculated to be 47.9% (n = 35). CONCLUSION: Despite the 
      opportunities provided by innovation - automation, electronic health records, 
      hospital-based information systems, biobanks, rare disease registries and 
      European Reference Networks - the results of the current scoping review 
      demonstrate a diversity of the challenges that must still be addressed, with 
      immediate actions on ensuring better governance of rare disease registries, 
      implementing FAIR principles, and enhancing the EU legal framework.

AB  - The quality and safety of edible crops are key links inseparable from human 
      health and nutrition. In the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, 
      using it to mine multi-source information on edible crops provides new 
      opportunities for industrial development and market supervision of edible crops. 
      This review comprehensively summarized the applications of multi-source data 
      combined with machine learning in the quality evaluation of edible crops. 
      Multi-source data can provide more comprehensive and rich information from a 
      single data source, as it can integrate different data information. Supervised 
      and unsupervised machine learning is applied to data analysis to achieve 
      different requirements for the quality evaluation of edible crops. Emphasized the 
      advantages and disadvantages of techniques and analysis methods, the problems 
      that need to be overcome, and promising development directions were proposed. To 
      monitor the market in real-time, the quality evaluation methods of edible crops 
      must be innovated.

AB  - PURPOSE: Artificial Intelligence (AI) imitating human-like language, such as 
      ChatGPT, has impacted lives throughout various multidisciplinary fields. However, 
      despite these innovations, it is unclear how well its implementation will assist 
      patients in clinical situations. We evaluated changes in patient perceptions 
      regarding AI before and after reading a ChatGPT-written explanation. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In total, 24 South Korean patients receiving urolithiasis treatment 
      were surveyed through questionnaires. The ChatGPT explanatory note was provided 
      between the first and second questionnaires, detailing lifestyle modifications 
      for preventing urolithiasis recurrence. The study questionnaire was the Korean 
      version of the General Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence Scale, including 
      positive and negative attitude items. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were 
      accomplished to compare questionnaire scores before and after receiving the 
      explanatory note. A linear regression analysis with stepwise elimination was used 
      to assess variable (demographic data) accuracy in predicting outcomes. RESULTS: 
      There were significant differences between total negative questionnaire scores 
      pre- and post-surveys of ChatGPT, but not in the positive scores. Among 
      variables, only education level significantly influenced mean score differences 
      in the negative questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The negative perception change among 
      urolithiasis patients after receiving the explanatory note provided by the AI 
      chatbot program was observed, evidencing that patients with lower education 
      levels expressed a more negative response. The explanatory note provided by the 
      AI chatbot program could provoke an adverse change in AI perception. Negative 
      human responses must be considered to improve and adapt new technology in health 
      care. Only through changing patient perspectives will upgraded AI technology 
      integrate into medical healthcare.

TI  - Examining the Threat of ChatGPT to the Validity of Short Answer Assessments in an 
      Undergraduate Medical Program.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model that can interpret 
      free-text prompts and return detailed, human-like responses across a wide domain 
      of subjects. This study evaluated the extent of the threat posed by ChatGPT to 
      the validity of short-answer assessment problems used to examine pre-clerkship 
      medical students in our undergraduate medical education program. METHODS: Forty 
      problems used in prior student assessments were retrieved and stratified by 
      levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Thirty of these problems were submitted to 
      ChatGPT-3.5. For the remaining 10 problems, we retrieved past minimally passing 
      student responses. Six tutors graded each of the 40 responses. Comparison of 
      performance between student-generated and ChatGPT-generated answers aggregated as 
      a whole and grouped by Bloom's levels of cognitive reasoning, was done using 
      t-tests, ANOVA, Cronbach's alpha, and Cohen's d. Scores for ChatGPT-generated 
      responses were also compared to historical class average performance. RESULTS: 
      ChatGPT-generated responses received a mean score of 3.29 out of 5 (n = 30, 95% 
      CI 2.93-3.65) compared to 2.38 for a group of students meeting minimum passing 
      marks (n = 10, 95% CI 1.94-2.82), representing higher performance (P = .008, 
      η(2) = 0.169), but was outperformed by historical class average scores on the 
      same 30 problems (mean 3.67, P = .018) when including all past responses 
      regardless of student performance level. There was no statistically significant 
      trend in performance across domains of Bloom's Taxonomy. CONCLUSION: While 
      ChatGPT was able to pass short answer assessment problems spanning the 
      pre-clerkship curriculum, it outperformed only underperforming students. We 
      remark that tutors in several cases were convinced that ChatGPT-produced 
      responses were produced by students. Risks to assessment validity include 
      uncertainty in identifying struggling students and inability to intervene in a 
      timely manner. The performance of ChatGPT on problems requiring increasing 
      demands of cognitive reasoning warrants further research.

AB  - Photodeformable polymer materials have a far influence in the fields of 
      flexibility and intelligence. The stimulation energy is converted into mechanical 
      energy through molecular synergy. Among kinds of photodeformable polymer 
      materials, liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) photodeformable materials have been a 
      hot topic in recent years. Chromophores such as azobenzene, α-cyanostilbene, and 
      9,10-dithiopheneanthracene have been widely used in LCP, which are helpful for 
      designing functional molecules to increase the penetration depth of light to 
      change physical properties. Due to the various applications of photodeformable 
      polymer materials, there are many excellent reports in intelligent field. In this 
      review, we have systematized LCP containing azobenzene into 3 categories 
      depending on the degree of crosslinking liquid crystalline elastomers, liquid 
      crystalline networks, and linear LCPs. Other structural, typical polymer 
      materials and their applications are discussed. Current issues faced and future 
      directions to be developed for photodeformable polymer materials are also 
      summarized.

PG  - 100121
LID - 10.1016/j.jacig.2023.100121 [doi]
LID - 100121
AB  - BACKGROUND: Provocation tests are widely used in allergology to objectively 
      reveal patients' sensitivity to specific allergens. The objective quantification 
      of an allergic reaction is a crucial characteristic of these tests. Because of 
      the absence of objective quantitative measurements, the conjunctival provocation 
      test (CPT) is a less frequently used method despite its sensitivity and 
      simplicity. OBJECTIVE: We developed a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
      method, called AllergoEye, for quantitative evaluation of conjunctival allergic 
      reactions and validated it in a clinical study. METHODS: AllergoEye was 
      implemented as a 2-component system. The first component is based on an Android 
      smartphone camera for screening and imaging the patient's eye, and the second is 
      personal computer-based for image analysis and quantification. For the validation 
      of AllergoEye, an open-label, prospective, monocentric study was carried out on 
      41 patients. Standardized CPT was performed with sequential titration of grass 
      allergens in 4 dilutions, with the reaction evaluated by subjective/qualitative 
      symptom scores and by quantitative AllergoEye scores. RESULTS: AllergoEye 
      demonstrated high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (90%) as compared with human 
      estimation of allergic reaction. Tuning cutoff thresholds allowed us to increase 
      the specificity of AllergoEye to 97%, at which point the correlation between 
      detected sensitivity to allergen and specific IgE carrier-polymer system class 
      becomes obvious. Strikingly, such correlation was not found with sensitivity to 
      allergen detected on the basis of subjective and qualitative symptom scores. 
      CONCLUSION: The clinical validation demonstrated that AllergoEye is a sensitive 
      and efficient instrument for objective measurement of allergic reactions in CPT 
      for clinical studies as well as for routine therapy control.
